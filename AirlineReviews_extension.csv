1.0,"• Hours before  takeoff we received  a Mail stating  in cryptic message  saying there are  delays to be  queues as there is a limit on how many planes can leave  all the same  time So did  the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise,  hours before departure? Anyhow - we 're the one  without delay so  long - but  still we have  be forced to  fly in our Hand luggage. I travel only with  Hand luggage to avoid waiting for  this ultra slow  arrival of the  checked in luggage.  Always 2h later  get home than  normal with really  good reason, just  due to incompetent  Air Service level  was worse then  normal and triple  the price. Really never again. Thanks  or nothing."
3.0,"we recently had a delay on British Airways from  London to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding  pattern but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the  next 2 hours  on the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at  the seats. The staff provided a small bag of  food and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First  floor lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded,  dirty and poorly equipped. The help  desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations , even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent  times and has  been moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much  less service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
8.0,"Left on time,  though it took  time to get  to the runway  thanks to congestion.  Service was smooth  and quick. Snack  & drinks were  available for a  late flight. Landed  in about ten  seconds late. One bag of three  was in London,  was quickly filled , and the  bag was delivered  the next morning."
1.0,"3 days before  my flight, we  are advised by BA that it  has been cancelled  who asked us  to rebook. There  were flights 1  hour before and  one hour after  our original flight  so they made  them take one  4 hours earlier.  The original ticket  for the return  flight a week  ago included a  checked bag. When  they arrive at  BA to check , we are  informed our ticket  only included a  backpack and we  will have to  pay 75 pounds  more to take ! We explained  that the original  tickets had the  luggage and when  they checked the  ticket they confirmed  what it did- but not this ? They would  spare no effort  and sort it , and just  tell us to  pay up or  it would remove  it from the  flight So we  have no choice  but to pay  up thinking it  will be pretty  simple to get  our refund. 15  days and 10  hours later we  have still not  paid a penny.  Each time I  check where my  flight is and  ask how long  I have been  travelling I get  an inane email  and some departments  took longer than  usual to respond! ?! Absolutely hopeless  attempt to stuff  with the booking  from the first  place and even  worse customer service  will not even attempt to solve  the problem at  once in even  if they could  correct the mistake  they had made  on their system,  simply by being  completely unable to  file a very  valid claim, and  charging me 150  dollars in 15  days"
1.0,"We traveled to  Portugal for our  first vacation, a cruise to Portugal  & Spain. Our  friend did not  go get their  bags It was  the two week cruise. Two weeks  with a change of clothes or  a CPAP machine. Contacting customer service  is a nightmare.  We never talked  to a real  airline Very little  effort was put  in getting them their bags. In  the port we were on the  boat and the bags were at  the airport. The airlines did not  take the bags  neither did they  tell our friends  what they needed  a go get  bags The airline  could be bothered  or take the  bags from the  port to the  airport BA says  it is their policy to get you your bags within 72 hours.  That is a  joke It’s been  over two weeks and they still don’t have them. They are back home in the  states and last  they heard the  planes were in  Portugal If your  making a choice,  do not fly  British Airways. Customer  service is non stop"
1.0,"On a flight from Bucharest to Manchester with a 2h 45’ layover  at Heathrow. Flight  got delayed from  Manchester because of  the strike. Arrived  to Heathrow 40 minutes later than  expected and still had enough time  to catch my connecting flight. Unfortunately  we were stranded  inside the plane  and waited a  VERY long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage , a common  occurrence with BA at Heathrow). I missed my connecting  plane because of their delays and  BA told me  they had to  sleep all night in a freezing  airport for the  next flight the  next day. There  were just a shameful 10£ food  bill which is  a joke considering the ridiculous prices  at LHR. No  meals offered and  had to sleep in a very  crowded airport. I  asked for compensation  but they sent  out a long  letter with the  same lame excuses that they are sorry, but they  did not compensate anything.  I  can imagine a  better airline than BA regarding customer  care It is not about money  anymore but rather  about the way  you treat customers.  That is the  first time in  our lifetime that  you will be  seeing this joke  about an airline."
8.0,"Got online months  ago and the  only hitch was  on aircraft meaning chosen seats were  tight I was  informed of this prior to departure  but could amend. Bag drop at  seat T3 wasn't  easy but I  guess that was  our fault. Shuttle boarding was slow , delayed meaning  the rush at  flight T5. The  bus to CPT  is full but  it left more  than less on time. The cabin  looked clean and  it was what  we expected, sufficient  bed and arm  rests plus a few little perks  for drinks. Only  downside is the  chairs actually recline  that far. Staff  was very good  during the first few hours of  flight especially George.  Dinner was quite  loaded but one  seat wasn't loaded.  Lunch was also quite tasty and we landed on  a The fly  in the ointment  was both our  bags arrived late  at the carousel  and only later  would we notice  they had been broken into, likely  from CPT. All  in all a  nice surprise."
7.0,"My flight was  in time. The  staff were polite.  This was the  usual story on  my outward flight. I find that  alcohol in Europe  was generally pretty good, though I  wish that they  recently substituted Prosecco  for Champagne on  the list of  drinks you can  get in economy!  The many complaints  against BA and  other airlines revolve  around lost luggage ! I never  slept in bags,  not for long ."
2.0,"Very disappointed, and  confused My route  is from London  and Atlanta. My  bag was not  packed therefore not  coming with me.  From both comfort  and safety reason, a bag always  arrives with its  passengers and that  could not happen. Claims and few  telephone calls were  answered by desk  staff who answered  the questions unprofessionally  or miserably. Certainly,  I was left  with nothing but  my backpack which  had not more  then few snacks. Neither clothes nor  something else was ever provided as  an apology. Meanwhile,  there was also  told that my bag would have  been delivered through  the next 24 hours which also  did not happen.  British Airways is  another great airline  to fly with  but its organization,  but it comes  its customer service,  was poor and  slow Still waiting for my bag."
3.0,"For an infrequent  traveller British Airways  were always my  first choice. With some reassurance and  quality of service,  no luggage allowance . In fact I’ve never flown  below the budget ! My most recent flight has  certainly changed my  mind and causes  one to reflect  on what am  I actually getting  from my money and is BA  as they once  were While the  planes were around an hour delayed  both ways, the  food and ground  stop service were  excellent It is  these facilities (or  lack of) that I am most  bothered by. The  trip was Approx  three and a  half hours and  the only thing  offered was a  single cup of  coffee that was poured out and  one bite sized  banana slice of  bread In fact  in my return  journey I wasn’t  actually offered the  sandwich To top it off BA no longer have  their media screen  on which you  simply select something  to pass the  information away. There  were even the  long flight journey.  While WiFi was  down I couldn’t  really access the shop. However, for  a fee so much more was . This explains  a record profit  at £1.52bn. So,  the question is,  what am I  waiting for? I  can now for  and opt for  more budget airlines.  Which are transparent with what they  charge and what  they have to pay for, which  I can decide to choose or  ignore As BA now stands for  Basic Airways I’ll  fly elsewhere and get basic for cheaper."
8.0,"A totally unremarkable  breakfast on time,  very comfortable as  the configuration goes.  Reduced catering due  to the storm  was effect greatly exaggerated. This was advised by email,  however a euro  menu was provided  and not easy  to use -  this lounge made  due for this loss."
1.0,"1. Ground crew in Heathrow left 60 passengers luggage.  I had 3 . 2. The Heathrow ground crew left 1 of ours behind after the 1st two  we received the  previous day. 3. The Heathrow ground crew lost our 3rd bag 4 times and we  sat on the  plane with them for over 3 hrs over the  rest of the week! 4. Due  ot this, we had to spend $500 on health  and beauty items  for my wife  during our cruise. 5. British Airways said they MIGHT  return after 3 months. 6. We had to spend $100 in cab  fares to Barcelona because the Bacelona ground crew (Iberia) claimed they had delivered it to  us 7. Heathrow  ground crew made us 15 minutes late arriving back  to Heathrow after our cruise. We actually landed 10 minutes early, but those incompetent people still were not ready for us. 8. The Heathrow  flight crew caused us to leave 45 minutes late even though ALL passengers were boarded  & ready 15 minutes before the  departure time. This  would probably mean  we will miss  my connection in Anchorage. BA clearly does not care or know how to operate a ground base...shameful. BA is a joke and should be  ashamed they can't  operate like a  commercial airline. They do not grasp the concept that even a small hiccup can cause mass ripples of chaos to other people."
6.0,"London Heathrow to Gibraltar on 24th  March 2023. I shall start by  pointing to the booking process. I  use the BA  website to reserve  my seat and food the website  to be easy  of use and  reliable in every aspect. The flight  were due to  depart from terminal  one but the  aircraft were bussed for a good  45 minutes to a different part of the airport  where the aircraft  was on a  platform When boarding the flight the  passengers kept a  very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight. The  captain made 3  audio announcements during  each flight. There  were no in-flight  announcements The seats  are clean and comfortable enough for a short flight.  The lack of  service was overt. Other than a tiny bottle of  coffee and an inedible “breakfast bar” one had to use an online  menu to order even a drink and of course pay for it too. The passengers  speaking to me  do not use the online system as it doe nt seem to  exist and the  attendant refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault. Moreover, the USB charge  point did not work either. Given the early hour  of the flight it is a poor show that there are not  drinks for sale  and available from  the trolley service. The system BA have in place  was not good ! The flight  arrived on-time. The  flight was inefficient  though and poorly managed and the  staff were not  much be seen. The crew were wearing the new  BA uniform and  this seems to reflect a downward  trajectory of the airline. To be candid, there was any difference between  a BA service  to that of  their “budget” rivals. On this route  we have a  hotel and so  I did not have an option  but use the services of a  private company."
8.0,Second time flying  US Airways and  we would not  hesitate to fly economy with them . Flight attendants  very pleasant and  friendly Excellent special  food (low sodium).  Cargo space in  Economy One of  our better flights.
7.0,"I flew London to Cairo and  Dubai in October : It was  also a perfectly good pair of flights in Economy,  very pleasant and  helpful cabin crew  ( on the return journey). Being  about 1.73 m tall I have  little problem with  sitting in the back of the  seat the seat  is OK if getting a little  crowded after 5 hours, and the  offer of a rather good included  DVD box and  snacks was welcome. However, it must be said that the value for  money was poor:  as a checked  bag on the return leg only,  it was a  hefty £700 ticket. And although I  am content to  take the time  with reading or  writing it was surprising to find  no in-flight entertainment on 5-hour flights.  But overall I would still recommend  this and would  say so even  more enthusiastically if  this was more sensibly priced."
1.0,"Absolutely the worst experience ever.  Flew into Heathrow, no problem. Waited for 5 hours,  2 extra hours,  for our connection  in Porto then the cancelled the flight. Scrambled for  a hotel and  our new flight the next day.  Airways routed us through Madrid the next morning. That flight was 1.5 hours late so we missed our connection to Porto. Because we missed the connection (their  fault they cancelled our return flights. After two hours on the phone with customer service  at the Madrid airport, they booked us a new  return flight, then they made is pay $ 1300 to fly from Madrid to Porto. Then, for no  reasons they cancelled our return flight . After hours, and hours and hours with customer service, we finally  got a return flight five days after our original return flight. Meanwhile, they lost my wife's luggage. We finally got 15 DAYS after they lost it. Return  flight More problems with our reservations. At no point was British Airways helpful. They left the onus on  me to fix their mistakes at every turn. They  completely ruined a three week vacation and they don't care. They wouldn't even let us speak to a supervisor or manager.  Totally bordering on passenger abuse."
8.0,Flew back from  India after scattering our son's ashes at his favourite spots. When we boarded the aircraft  for our return  trip my wife  seemed upset. A  Member of the  cabin crew noticed this and immediately  spoke to my  husband and tried  to reassure her.  Her name is  is an exceptional crew member. I noticed she spoke to other travellers  in a courteous  tone and was friendly. Each time  I passed my  daughter she asked how she was  or would she like anything. This kindness made a  stressful time easier for us both. Aircraft seats were comfortable and service  excellent for a 2hrs. 45mins. flight. Thank you B.A.
3.0,"Cabin luggage had  to go to cargo, even when  it said I  had medicines. There was no time to get them out the hand . The economy seats with Virgin , KLM and even Ryanair have  limited space. Luckily it was a  long flight."
4.0,"We have been using BA for  quite while now  and on average  I cannot say  that I am  not satisfied. BA  does experience cancellations  & delays most  times the time. Second, the in-flight  service is usually  better Food portions  is small and  the crew is  not very helpful especially when it  came to drink ! The screens  on the A380s should be renewed  as they are  made of scratches  and same size  as A321s. Especially  during longer flights, the entertainment system  seems more important.  This is also  a welcome package  especially for pillow , small blanket.  We would expect more from BA.  When you are flying from the US to anywhere  in the UK, I would recommend  the other airlines. But if you are flying to/from UK directly, then BA could be  one of your  choices"
1.0,"I flew from  Manchester to London . Business class.  For more than  part of the  flight a child  sat watching an iPad very loud with no phones plugged in - it was three rows in front  of me and disrupted my flight  before I could  hear it above my headphones. Staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the  children to turn  things down. Why  is this acceptable  on a flight  class in business ?! Has this  airport turned into  another zoo? Are staff given no training in customer  care Why is a child allowed  the disrupt other passengers? When I told the staff she just laughed at me. BA  food service is  absolute disgrace. I've  never even mentioned the food but it was bad,  real bad."
1.0,"They have flow on BA several  years since the  airlines started non-stop  flying between Austin,  TX and London . Every year  the service gets  longer I brought  the tape measure with me to  see how far  out the seats  are in the  aisle section. 25½ inches. BA has  added bathrooms in  Austin to squeeze  a few more  rows of seats onto the aircraft.  Although I'm not a big person  and was able  can squeeze into  one seat without  getting too uncomfortable. When BA first  began flying out of Austin, the  service was great.  Now when I 'm at Heathrow,  I get real food and take  them on the  flight with me.  I don't know  what or who  makes BA's food,  but it is  very eatable. If  we did not  want a direct  connection from my hometown to London,  it would fly  to a different  flight When we  checked into Heathrow,  our line was  very long and only one person  kept checking people ! It took  over an hour  we get to the counter. I understand airlines are making record profits  that need to  pick up lost revenue from the  airlines but I  feel BA has  pushed too far  or has little  concern for customer  care in pursuit of profits."
1.0,"The flight departed  over an hour late due to  a late inbound . The plane  was very full,  and half of the economy class  seats were forced  and check in  a larger cabin  back at the  gate when boarding,  with a complete  lack of the  standard luggage allowance ). Lots of  people on board  seemed stressed out  about missing onwards  flight due to  the delays (and  some did miss  boarding as their next  plane had closed  by the time  BA disembarked at !). Onboard service  was ok but  limited - BA  gave up being  no full-service airline  no time ago. More concerning is  that trying to  keep hold of  the services to  negotiate changes to  services and deal  with problems was  - The airline  seemed to make  it deliberately hard  for its customers  to contact it."
1.0,"I hate British . We get to London on Oct 3 and our next flight  was cancelled. We  stand in line  behind 1200 other people to get it fixed and  then tell everyone to leave the  line and call them to fix.  They book us  flights next day..via online. Don't offer  discount for hotel,  so will miss our tour. Now  have to get home from Istanbul.  Uber is here  but should have  been loading an  hr ago. No explanations. May miss  the flight. Will  NEVER travel with  him again. Was  this same problem  with 2022 flight."
5.0,"Our BA flight  via Porto to  Newark Heathrow T5  were operated by  Virgin using a  private plane and  airline This had  been advised by  us shortly after  arrival with the  opportunity to change flights if we preferred. Although the  business class cabin was of a  different layout to BA Club Europe, i.e. with the  back seat kept  in my wife  and I felt  our seats were more comfortable and  had legroom slightly . Service was good on board , the meal  itself very tasty  we chose the beef cheeks). All  is good until we landed at Heathrow! Although we  passed through passport control without delay,  once we were  at the designated  gate reclaim, we  then waited and … After an hour and ten  minutes I went  into the BA  information counter to  check what was going on. They  appeared unaware of an issue, but  thought they would  find out! Over  the next hour  of so various other passengers also requested information and  after various announcements and a list  with different excuses  it was almost  two hours before  our bags finally  cleared Frustrating to  say the least.  They subsequently complained to BA, but  for 4 weeks  this has been  NO explanation just the automated message from customer services  who are experiencing  very high volumes’.  This response says  A lot!"
3.0,"the customer services  (+ centres etc)  were atrocious and sometimes callous. They  really don’t care. Long waits to speak to anybody,  and then have  little power to actually solve anything, and the calls just cut halfway  towards resolution anyway.  When the flights  are cancelled (as were my original ) you’re really left on your own and nobody . The onboard services are so-so but for short haul it’s now  a cost” which is confusing as  you never know what to expect.  One time we were given a bottle of water  or a (very)  light snack, whilst  everybody else had to be paid . And yet  in some other  airlines apparently you have to pre-order any additional food.  Very confusing, which makes it not dependable. Cabin baggage is in theory  cheaper compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than  all the passengers  of this flight  for check in the cabin baggage  from the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins, leading to long boarding delays. Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well . The USB power supply did not  function throughout the flight (contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off ) so it was  not providing the  connection in the first place. Not  a first choice  airline on this  flight and am just trying to use up most  on my Avios  money before I totally abandon them. I fail to  see how it  got deemed a 4 star airline."
5.0,"I am a  regular flyer with  Delta and have  been for the  last 15 years.  Having noted the  following given, frankly,  and cannot understand how BA scores  5 stars for  all aspects of  their service. In  a nutshell, BA  clearly placed profit  priority over passenger  safety This fact  got hammered home  on my return leg, which was  done in Club . Quite alarmingly,  Boeing appears to place profit over  customer safety by  putting its ""Business ""- seating up  above and beyond  their exit rows , then failing  the ensure those  sitting in exit rows have the  necessary capacity to  hold open the door incase of  any emergency. I  am not at  ALL reassured to  have an elderly and slightly built woman seated with  sole responsibility of  opening the overwing exit should the  emergency have arisen.  The business (Club ) is simply  another joke and  is useful for  earning valuable tier points for lounge/pre-boarding benefits. While cabin  level service is  excellent the lack  for space and  variety in refreshment , etc. places  BA a million  miles behind competing  brands such as  the Turkish or  Emirates who understand  their true definition  for customer appreciation and hospitality. BA  has consistently eroded  in value of their Executive Club  but seems to  have of the impression that recent  success in obtaining  seat points during  a booking process  - passengers -  while I want  the support BA  - did enjoy  flying with them  up to the  day when they  started penny pinching  - became more  fond of the  airline ""Budget Airways""  The attached photos taking during my  most recent itinerary  shows the difference  of customer care/appreciation  from British Airways  and another airline  lacking in this . Both flights were around 4  hours in duration,  on the same day. Guess which  one is shows  better in-flight offering!"
4.0,"Flew with BA to Punta Cana.  Into the trouble  we reserve seats for both outbound and inbound flights.  After boarding at Gatwick, realised we had been moved to much less good seats with other people sitting in the seats we had spent a lot of money reserving. Apparently there has been a change of aircraft and a number of passengers had been automatically reallocated seats for no particular reason. The crew said there was nothing they could do (although of course they could just 've swapped us with the couple using our seats). We were told to claim a refund on return home. We did this via a complaint form Ns BA offered us £100 in vouchers. We didn't accept this as it was less than the cost of the seats and also naturally we wanted our money back. We eventually got it but not without a fight. Very second rate shoddy airline."
1.0,"He downgraded me from business to premium economy. They  took three months  to get back to me and offered me 200 pounds or 400 %. The difference  in business class and premium economy (which I never  use is $3000  AUD and the difference between economy  and business is  4000 AUD. They owe me at  best 1500 pounds and to be very fair 3250 pounds. The downgrade was insulting and  extremely painful as I had a  lung cancer operation  but have a back injury which  I have pointed  earlier to them  that I need to lie down. The wait for  them to get around to me has been numbing. The insult of  the offer has been the slap  across the face to continue my degradation. The people I have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth, honest hard working people. The actual staff on the  flight were warm and friendly -  very helpful. The systems under which  it operates are  some sort of  mental torture."
1.0,"An already delayed  plane landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage,  I was no  sign as to whom the carrier really was. Boarding turned into a  fiasco with passenger  members being told  to wait in  a queue in order to board, only to be informed we were  in the wrong  plane and our boarding wasn't allowed . The interior  design was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty  hours earlier except  for tight legroom  with uncomfortable seating  never made a  British airline feel luxurious. The crew  was not BA but from an unknown charter company.  Flight was slow,  and as usual,  offers of food to purchase ran out before they'd reached row 24. I requested a cup of tea  that never appeared. Thank goodness for  an airport purchased water and the tiny offering of  water The over  aged senior flight  attendants who'd been facilitating in 'Club ' appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests (whilst still in mid flight)  made an already  uncomfortable journey feel  like ""Cattle class"" was definitely that!  To say I  felt happy to  board and disembark  is an understatement.  Once again BA, never again!"
2.0,"Coming up in  the Gatwick cancellation fiasco; at some  time between what  were smooth check  out (unable to  check online as  part of group ), and security,  our flight was cancelled; (we were  denied entry to  arrivals and departures  was a result).  This was at  which point that  I discovered BA  who are not  passengers but a  company who are  happy to help , and provide  as little assistance  to the 'real  people provide information,  who even though our baggage was now airside, didn't have a clue as to how  I could get  ours back. It  did however, with  regards to a  call from Business  Class check in,  that came to  our assistance and help with our  own baggage retrieval,  advice on what  baggage claim and  claim and our  connecting BA flight  into LHR the  following evening. (Difficult  to give a rating for cabin  crew as we  didnt even board  an aircraft)"
1.0,"BA has a  huge problem with boarding it's flights.  Customers who get on first fill the luggage bins  of 2 bags, one of which  is supposed to  be small and under seat only. Cabin staff don't bother implementing their own rules. Subsequent  passengers mill up and down the aisle, bumping into each other, searching for space. Boarding  our flight took  an hour as  a result of this nonsense. The  next flight was  boarding already so our 90 minute flight was 90 minutes late."
1.0,Our connecting flight  to London to  Paris was canceled  and we were  forced to wait  two hours in  JFK airport for  the new flight.  When we received  our luggage at  customs we discovered  both our luggage  is soaking wet.  The wife’s luggage  also were wet  so had to  have air dried.
1.0,Most worst airline I have ever  flown with. Allocated  a very back  seats next to the toilets and  seats No chance  at getting any  important question asked  about possible seat  requests ignored and  got bumped the  whole time by  the crew walking  and pushing kart  down and down  stairs without one  seat Would have been better sitting  with the luggage  rack
10.0,"Good service levels,  knowledgeable crew and  excellent food and beverages. I found all aspects of the service to  be superior to  standard business class,  particularly the new  Premium Club Suites.  Second Class felt  as the dedicated  crews were clearly  dedicated to working the premium cabin,  doing their work,  very proactive, friendly,  highly respectful and  the food and  beverages offering a  great step up from business class.  Each seat, with  the double doors was spacious, well  fitted and very comfortable.  British Airways offered a  great First Class  experience from Concorde  flight to boarding (which was actually by group number for a change)  with the very  warm and genuine welcome on boarding. A consistent, solid,  friendly service from start to finish and if the  price was right, I would not hesitate to book First Class with British Airways again."
1.0,"Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived  and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the  seat was over booked and our  tickets wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year  prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy.  My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to  some lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting  for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them  and eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer  in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country  having no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able  even plan our days in hope we would get the call to  then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going  without my insurance. British Airways only  pay for basic  hygiene Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them. Do not give them your money, they cant even look  after their staff let alone customers. Oh and don't bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing <mask>"
2.0,"Just returned from Chicago, flew out  two days ago on American Airlines , superb in every way, had  high expectations on return flight with  such a disappointment.The  Airbus A380 may be nice from  a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful.Very uncomfortable seats,  the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work  during the flight, the inflight meal was inedible and  the service was  poor at best.  The short flight from Heathrow to  Chicago was much  improved very welcoming  very attentive in  the staff and  the flight even  left early. In future we will  return with one of the American  airlines "
2.0,"BA standards continue to decline every time I fly with them. This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz  cabin costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving , but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year. Onboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that  they can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was  excellent - guessing BA are too tight with their budget. Onboard WiFi service is a joke and should be avoided."
2.0,"Awful. Business class check in queue  is as long as for economy,  mostly because half of the desks  is not staffed , Terminal 5 is chaotic. Business  was overfull, couldn't get seats. Delayed , unmanaged chaos at the gate.  Last drink on boarding, first drink served an hour  from take-off. The meal was poor, used to get better in economy  by other airlines. British Airways has  won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate ! Not looking forward to the flight home."
3.0,"What a reliable  flight You cannot trust the timing at all. I had a 6.45am flight, boarding was  in time, but then we are sitting in the plane for already  3 hours) and the expected departure is still not clear. They have discovered the engine is not working! I am risking to be late for a business meeting in Geneva. How come they bring a not working plane to  our gate. The funny thing is  that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to Amsterdam. When I arrived to the Airport that  morning - I 'm told I don't have a  ticket I was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too much. A lot of stress.  In the end, on the second  day we were sitting in the cabin for 1.5 hours and I have missed the  plane I thought  I was a dramatic unlucky case that time, but today I see it's routine for  me not to fly on time."
1.0,"I take comfort  after reading the last ten or so reviews to see I'm not the only traveller to put in words, how absolutely abysmal British Airways are! The only  way we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points. We booked Club Europe months ago. London to  London sat in row 3 and told they had  run out of food options, only choice was lentil pie or green  curry Returning Athens to London Club Europe. Couldn't check in online as promised so arrived at the airport 3hrs early. To be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being 'bumped' to economy. This airline fails to deliver time  and time again. It is a national disgrace and I implore everyone to choose an alternative. "
3.0,"My worst journey in my life. The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour, but the flight  at MXP was on delay. I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a  panic attack. After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes. Despite that,  on arrival at  BA my baggage was lost. I filled the form  I gave to  an employee. I was not given  the receipt, so  it did not have any reference  to BA phone number at SJC simply never answer. I called twice the toll free  number and realized they did not record the delivery  so I had  to enter myself online, dealing with  their shitty website.  BA delivered the baggage three days later. I claimed  my compensation online,  but I had to buy clothes , other stuff and I did never get a  response I was expecting an upgrade for the flight  home to MXP,  and nothing happened, neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at . Bad customer service. The only positive side was price, but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew , I would never flown by . Never again!"
4.0,"Most airplanes and  the lounges are  sold out, old  or broken. From  London to Heathrow,  all first class  seating and electronics  are non functional , poorly designed. The first class  flight from Heathrow  into Dubrovnik was  no more than  the tray blocking  one middle seat  on a standard  airline ticket. Very  disappointing"
1.0,"One of the worst experiences on the worst airline. The flight was  delayed due to earlier technical issues.  Flight time slipped from 17:00 to 20:00 to 22:00  then finally cancelled. There was zero information given. Despite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours  for the flight. When it was finally cancelled, the BA staff. Without explanation, told everyone  we go to a gate. After another hour or  two they made us re enter the UK via  immigration control, a  nearly 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign  about our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA  regulations refused to find us accommodation.  We slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t  afford somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to  some admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2  hour flight. Overall the service was shockingly bad, the worst I have experienced from any airline. I will  NEVER ever use them again."
1.0,"Cancelled our flight last-minute then moved  us onto a flight 2 days  later operated by  British Airlines. We had paid a lot extra for  extra legroom seats as I am  fairly tall and they assigned me  to middle seat  right in the middle of the  row Because it 's operated by a different airline but booked by BA, neither BA nor the other  airlines could change  the seat over the phone despite  seats being available.  For 4 hours  of waiting in queues and sitting on hold their solution was for me to arrive  late at the airport. I did  as the seats  having already been given away for  FREE by people  I had booked  in with that  company and could check in online.  We got a £10 meal voucher as compensation for  my enormous downgrade  on a 14 hr flight. Never  more will I  trust BA. I  will rather fly indirect with better  fares than use  this disgrace of  a airline again."
1.0,"I had a  trip from Miami,  FL to Dublin,  UK via London's Heathrow airport. The  connecting flight from  Miami was delayed  and we were further delayed when  a gate was  locked when we  arrived in Heathrow. The total delay was roughly an hour but it 's enough to  make our connection  time challenge, where  it had 73  days between original  departure time until  our departure time to Dublin. When  were headed to  our connection flight,  we were stopped  by security personnel  at a checkpoint and told us that the gate  for our connection  plane had already closed. This was twenty minutes prior  the departure time. They ushered us  into customer service  could be rebooked.  Given the busy weekend of travel,  we were rebooked  on a flight  to a different  airline and were  informed that our  cost to get  home would be reimbursed. We then  spent 3 hours  getting our luggage,  which then took  the cab to London's City Airport. The cab fare  was roughly $500. When I filed a claim with British Airways, they  denied the claim and told me  why we had  hours of time to make our connecting flight and  that they denied my claim to be reimbursed for  my cab fare. This is after I explained that  was was British Airways employees who  asked us to  make the flight  within the 20 minute timeframe to  make the connecting flight. The person who rebooked us,  told us it  was policy that  they close the  gates 20 minutes  previous to departure.  I will never  trust this awful airline again. Given  all other feedback  to this site,  It appears that  that is the overwhelming sentiment."
1.0,We started our  journey with BA  in Prague. The  planes actually left  in time! I  tried to find  somewhere that’s very . We purchased  first class seats.  But you can  imagine from the  airline they hardly  do business class.  But they did  is block off  a middle seat  for the first few rows and  made it business ! Horrible flight. In addition I  experienced a really  really rude check  ticket clerk basically  yelling at me . I excused  myself and asked  how she could  give a little  level of priority  to the many  first class passengers  who weren’t being . Then we  went to Heathrow  and the real  problems began. We  had a 4  hour delay. They  asked us about  5 different excuses  of the delay.  I had a  couple employees walk  by while I  was asking them . They were  really rude. At  one point there  were no employees . And from  their announcements it  seems virtually every  single flight was ! And there  was no weather . There was  NO place to  properly store items  for business class.  I never experienced  that before. Not even a cup board for my  bottle of water.  The seat controls  dont work well.  You had to  start pushing the  button to get  things to do ! The power outlet didn’t work.  I was no  ventilation the entire  flight The overhead  overhead bin was  too heavy. I  nearly got a hernia having to  lift it. This  made a horrible  experience I’ll never  stay with them … If I  could give zero  credit I would.
1.0," I fly British  Air weekly not  because I want  to but because  they own the route there’s no  other option therefore they frankly don’t  appear to care  about the customer.  The flights are always delayed and  its always someone  is fault be  they weather delays  on incoming aircraft , flight traffic  related issues I’ve  seen it all  up for the  lives of me  to understand why they are allowed  to operate. I’ve  flown around the world and traveled with all of  The world’s airlines but British Airways are really the  worse of the worst. It’s such  an shame to  having watched what used to be  such good company fall down a  hole My advice  is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then  take the option , if you’re  flying with different connections and you  need a tight schedule do not  allow BA to  fly you to  the destination in  advance"
1.0,"All was ok until our connecting flight in London, just before take offs we were on the runway, the pilot came on to announce an engine problem. After engineers tried  and fix it while we waited  on the plane  for over an  airport we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special  agent was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there 's no one to help us. In fact everyone refused to help ! It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the  connecting one in London and the staff saw this  but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was  always a message that said just  not use the app. Finally I got someone on  the phone who  scheduled us for the next day. Now it's 10:30pm  so I have to find a  new room because the airline refused also to help us with that.  Now i had 2 choices either sleep in the  airport or pay over 700GBP for a room. I don't have the money to pay  all this but after a 10  hour flight, 8 hours of jet  lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I  booked the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since so I have no idea when  and how much I'll be reimbursed, even though I'm not claiming any emotional compensation from  the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It's financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to  half my salary  but of course it's impossible to reach them by phone. I feel  exactly as i did on August 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information"
1.0,"My initial flight was cancelled 8  minutes prior the flight. Then I  got automatically rescheduled for next day. Next day, the  plane was delayed  at Hamburg and  cancelled my connecting flight to Las  Vegas Me and several other passengers spent the night in London. British Airways provided us  with vouchers but  the transfer bus dropped us at  a wrong hotel  next to our  flight and told  me that we can walk there  whenever we want to. As a result, I lost  my nights hotel reservations that I  had in las  Vegas I opened  my claim and  gave all receipts  with British Airways  to get refund of my hotel reservations, but over  two weeks now, not a single feedback from British  Airlines I will avoid all flights with them in future, and will share this story."
1.0,We will never  repay British Airways ! Our flight on July 15 2023 from LHR to LAX was  delayed 20 hours before departure without any explanation. Since  two weeks we 're now waiting for the refund  because BA does not pay us the cost caused  by the cancellation.  How disappointing.
6.0,"Check in and  security clearance very  quickly at LHR T5. My wife and I used the Galleries North lounge and at 6-00am it was easy to get  our seat. Good  continental breakfast options.  We boarded on  arrival and flight departed on time. I was seated in 4 A,  the Club Europe seats on the A320 seem to be getting smaller and legroom (I am 6ft) was very tight. Cabin Crew service was  excellent I chose the full English  and it was ok, but there  was a lot of water in  one bottom of the bowl. Flight landed on time.  Overall an OK flight but Club Europe doesn’t feel very premium these days."
1.0,"Jet Airways has confirmed itself as  your worst airline  in the UK.  last minute cancellation,  zero explanation, refusal to book with  another airline “because  they don’t have  an arrangement with "". What’s happened  with what used  to be our  favourite airline?"
2.0,"Worst BA experience. I was supposed  to fly out to Italy on 7 September 2023.  I arrived at OR Tambo International airport ready to check my bags in (I already  booked online the previous evening so I had my  baggage pass ready). At the counter I was told  the I had  been off-loaded from  the flight as  the connecting flight has been cancelled.  More information was sent regarding this ! The team at the check-in  counter tried to get me on another flight that  day but there were no flights available. They did manage to get me another flight the following evening , Lufthansa to Italy via Frankfurt. However, I did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and  a half later than I was supposed to. Upon moving the flights I did ask the BA staff whether my flights  tickets are still valid and that everything is in order, which they assured me is correct. I have to fly back to South Africa on 18 September and upon checking my booking information I noticed on my BA account , my first flight (Milan to  Milan is just missing from my booking. My connecting from London to Johannesburg is still there. After spending the entire morning  calling the customer , two different operators picked up and in both instances, the moment I proceed to give my booking reference number, my call gets dropped.  So it seems like I will be arriving at the airport again on Monday without  the flight."
1.0,"My daughter and I were denied boarding on our business class flight from Madrid to Heathrow in March 25, 2023, the first leg on our return flight to Victoria, Canada. No reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the British Airways counter in Madrid, who said they were only agents and told us to  call British Airways. We were three  days early for the flight and had valid passports. After many tries we finally reached British Airways by phone, but we were told to call Expedia which had booked the flights. Expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight, with no explanation as to why. Expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights. Over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both Expedia and British Airways. Incredibly, the next available flights were 9 days later on April 3. This was almost unbelievable, but after many many tries it was the best we could do. Even though  they were Business Class tickets. Part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight. This nine day delay was a major problem for us. I had to miss work and my daughter was missing school. Further, we received no compensation from British Airways, no penalty fee, and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days. After our return I  used the British Airways online complaint process, and submitted all supporting documents. I received an email reply and a case reference number. And then nothing. I sent numerous follow up emails, and received no replies. It is now months later, and still  we have not heard from British Airways. This is shocking, and definitely the worst airline service I have received for my thousands of flights over many decades. I am a very patient person and this is the first time I have commented on this type of forum. I think the public should be made aware of extremely poor customer service at British Airways."
8.0,"The boarding being the usual free for all at LHR with groups 1-3 being called  onto board all at once. Whilst  most passengers who had agreed to check in a bag in at the gate, getting to board before  everyone else! However,  the service on board was impeccable. Superb crew, friendly, attentive, interacting with  customers and generally appearing to be  doing their job. Like BA in  the old days and at its  height Food choice  and quality seems  to have improved  considerably (no beef  cuts thankfully) and  indeed the Club  experience appears to have returned. Old style Club seating,  this is at least better, and feels less cramped, on the 787's."
1.0,"Not cancelled, no , 9th September  is not peak  demand period so  is such bad management by BA?  Not to the  passengers left standing  for over and  again and then  again cancelled. As  any other on  this day. Why  does BA continue  and provide such  poor service -  A national disgrace."
1.0,The worst service  is my baggage  did not arrive  at time. Both  the flights were  cancelled I will  never fly them  back  Even  my food was  terrible and your service.
1.0,Most flights we booked this holiday  are delayed about 1-2 hours. No wifi available on  flights of 4 . Food and  drinks very basic and expensive. Cannot recommend
1.0,"British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers. I was booked to fly from Frankfurt  Main to London  Heath Airport, and  only a couple of hours before  my scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by  them without explanation, when I was already at the  gate The worst thing was the utter callousness that  they showed towards customers. The ground  handling attitude was : they are merely third party , not BA employees, and therefore , quickly washed their hands of  us all, telling  customers we had to contact BA  management via phone  if we wanted . They couldn’t  actually provide us  the phone number, telling us to  look it up on ba.com !  Then BA abandoned its passengers. They  would tell us  the the BA departure to Heathrow  was also been cancelled, meaning there  will be no further BA flight  connecting Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines  was still operating the route- but  still refused to rebook us on !). The reason  given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. No assistance or information was  given on our  behalf due to cancellation, nor any information on help  for food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was  our problem, not theirs. I received  a email an  instant later notifying  them that I had been automatically  put on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to  London that night.  I rang BA’s  call centre and again, they showed  a high degree  and callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent  with me waiting  in hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour,  and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me  up when the line cut (and  they had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal  B of Frankfurt Main airport), even  when my phone number is listed  on my booking  card details. They  clearly don’t care. In the end , had to  arrange my own  flight to London by taking a coach to Hanh , which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and  finally booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair  from Stansted. At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London!  This is worse than a low cost carrier now."
8.0,"From Heathrow to Keflavik, Iceland in  Business Class on an A321. British Airways provides an  exceptional Business Class experience for intra-Europe ! The seating is similar to  other airlines - middle seat vacant , little extra space - but on British Airways  their Business Class  seating extends to  over half the aircraft. This makes  for less than a premium experience  at every step, from boarding to onboard. The WiFi  lasts for only half the flight and there are  no refunds. But  once it worked it was surprisingly  good Service on this flight was  very good and we got to  Frankfurt on time."
8.0,"Flying to London  arrived in Business  class on an  Airbus B777-200. This  aircraft featured the  usual Club World  class seats. They  are comfortable, there  was enough storage space around the  seat and the monitor screen is  among the larger ones I've seen  on airplanes. BA's new Club Suites  were said to  be far superior,  compared with the  newer B-class rivals.  An entire Business  World cabin had  just 2 washrooms , it wasn't an issue on  the flight since the premier section wasn't at full capacity. There was  wifi on board,  nice enough to even send videos via messaging apps. Service onboard was  decent but the  cabin lacked warmth.  Fast food was  bland and no . The biggest  benefit of this  airline is that it gets out of Bombay at 1:10 pm in  the afternoon instead  than the ungodly  mid morning hours  that international flights  took off from . The airport  service is far  from pleasant at this time. In  short British Airways  had a good,  but not spectacular,  Economy Class product."
2.0,"Support and support shocking. Written by a previously loyal BA traveller. Lies , misleading unprofessional  behaviour Told that my flight was cancelled. Booked on  to next available  flight in downgraded  economy from business  economy premium economy. Called to ask why. Told technical  difficulties with my original flight. My  illness was another reason. At airport,  someone in staff  said that not  allow crew to staff original flight  earlier in day. Why take my money and allow  BA to book  my flight which  should have allowed  me to get  my work as a doctor in the first place!  How can you  expect such an  airline to look  after you as a flying customer."
1.0,"Flying A380 business  classes should be  pure pleasure but  management has made  BA a disaster with the worst  layout and configuration imaginable. How could  a sane person  just jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers  will be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and  you must face  the person until  one plastic screen  is raised. The  plastic screens are the size of  two medium sized  refrigerator and the  screens are behind  their head in a sitting position.  There is no  room to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground  zero that can not be reached  while seated nor accessed when sleeping , The window  seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an  aisle seat and the seats are  too low that  some are hard  and elderly to  jump out of. The whole business class set up  is a sick joke. Eating is  difficult because the  seat is not  high enough to  your table and the tables are  so flimsy that  they can fall off. Are there  other redeeming features , the answer is no. If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the  Emirates"
1.0,"UK Airways absolutely  did not care.  My reserved seat  was change from  one aisle to  aisle seat for  free overnight, full  service and it was quite awful.  When enquiring at  baggage check in,  an agent said , nothing we can do. Onboard  this flight the  crew seemed to try and finish the meal service  in a racing  horse with meals  being passed out , no proper  instructions about choice.  No back and  out trays and  they disappeared to  eat in the  queue for hours  after that. No  long runs, if  they need anything  just not bother  calling the call  button as they  just ignore it.  We used to  like travelling British  Airways 10-15 years , but the bean counters have been in and  cut it close  as a lowcost . I guess  they are badly  suffering from their  bad attitude and . My last trip to London , with Delta,  which are so  very better than  this very poor  imitation of an  offer that British  Airways has now :"
1.0,"My recent experience  at British Airways was not just horrendous, it was an utter abdication  for responsibility on their part. I arrived at JFK ready for my  plane to Malaga, only to find it had been cancelled with zero ! After a draining 2-hour altercation, I was finally  put on a different flight. The nightmare continued when I landed in Malaga sans luggage, containing essentials for my son's wedding. Thirty agonizing hours later, the bags  turned up—but my brand-new iPad and a special watch  for my nephew  remained missing. The items weren't merely  valuable they had emotional significance, which  rendered the loss even more gut-wrenching.  You think a reputable airline would make amends for such  errors.  Despite the clear mishandling of  our baggage by  the team, they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest  amount of airline credit. Their customer  service was not only ineffective but  also astonishingly callous.  The response was, in essence, ""It's your fault for trusting us with  our belongings."" This  isn just poor customer service; it's a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility. British Airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs  but chose not . If you have any respect  for your time, belongings, and emotional well-being, avoid British Airways at all ! They not only fail to  deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err, leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence."
1.0,"It is to  express our displeasure  and concerns regarding  the flight to : Our trip  is effectively ruined  through the failure  of our luggage  to arrive with  us coupled with  a length of  travel it took  from it to  finally reach us , and 12  hours Our departure  Date June 19,  2008 - Flight BA 294, Chicago  - London. June  20 rebooked by  BA on BA , London to  Chicago All flights  are late. On  arriving in Rome,  my wife was  asked to walk  through the check-in  desk because our  reservations for wheelchair  transportation from the  hotel was never  accepted by BA.  I was told  from the cabin  attendant that there was no reservation  in her transport.  Because our checked  bag (2) failed  t make the  previously rebooked flight  from London to  Chicago BA took  nine days to  find my bag , 12 days  to deliver my  luggage I called  the Baggage Claim  twice daily. I  am frequently cut  loose after waiting  in hold for  almost an hour.  I had Apple jack tags in  both bags, and  sent pictures showing  my exact location  of BA Baggage  Claim several times.  After 5 days,  they stated that  they found my  missing bag, but  failed to verify ! Both bags  I described had  bright pink 4”  easily visible tags  and bright pink . Taking 9  to 12 days  to deliver them  is inexcusable. Our  departure date: July  9 - BA  from Rome to  Chicago BA 297,  Chicago to Chicago.  All flights were  delayed We arrived  at Chicago more  then 3 hours  after missing our  return transportation to  return home in  Rome (3 hours ). We had  difficulty find a  motel and stay  somewhere near Chicago.  On July 12  BA filed our  claims for replacement  for lost clothing  & toiletries, also  some food purchased  at Heathrow due  for the flight  delay and overnight  food charges in . After 2  months I went  online asking for  any follow-up on  my cases, but  they had no  communication at all  from BA. We  are retirees on  one income, and  we fund BA’s . I can  safely say that  both times I  am able to  contact a human  and they were  so courteous and  happy to help,  or appeared at  a loss. "
1.0,"WE flew London to Malaga on 27 August in Club Europe. We stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for  almost an hour, with staff giving very different reasons for the delay, late inbound aircraft etc - but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for  more than an  hours After boarding,  our captain stated that because they had changed planes  there would be no meals served. This is Club Europe, and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight.  No effort to . We smelt the hot meal  of pilots being heated and then saw it being  handed to them  in a Club Europe meal tray. Cabin crew also had warmed pastries ( and were  very quick to use air freshener in the front galley!) while customers received zilch. BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry - nothing else. What a complete and utter rip  off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things. I paid  a full Business class fare, did not receive any  details of the onboard meal service  - they expect  an email to be sufficient. Avoid BA if you have any other option nowadays, they 're the worst in Europe."
1.0,"I arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in, go  thru security, etc. All that went without any issues. Being that I was relatively early at the gate, I was one of the first passengers there. After  that time boarding  was opened. First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they won’t let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in.  The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking  with a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was ). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn’t be  letting in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn’t receive immediately but got a hold of later  today thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways. Since they don’t have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone  headed to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not  one single person was either able to rebook my or anyone’s flight nor get anyone refunded. All the staff said was  that we were going to receive  an email in a couple hours  with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from  this same flight  headed back to the check-in counter  and get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned  our passport an looked at the  screen they found out that the system was dying that it was  his fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I  just missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly  this same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls <mask> said they were going to take care of it. We are <mask> to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able <mask> get a written confirmation that <mask> will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not <mask> that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but <mask> the customer <mask> being so horrible that they <mask> not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a <mask> of money which I would not know if I ever got <mask> backed."
1.0,"Nice plane, cabin staff ok, appalling customer service staff who couldn’t care  more when dealing with a complaint. Paid extra for club Europe/business class. Food was poor,  BA gave you  instructions to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate families. Not really what you expect when you pay for the extra service. Will be cancelling our other bookings we have with BA, even if that means we lose our deposit."
3.0,"Chaos at Terminal 5 with BA  flights and delays, and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask. 9 out 10 answers were . Sadly, BA airport standards at  London are worse than ever, and  we are long past being able to use Covid as an excuse.  For a short haul club Europe trip, I expect  precious little from BA any more, and they barely  even provide that, with cutbacks during  holidays that are  now permanent. If you can find  a alternative carrier  on the same route, choose them  better than BA.  Even on my  route BA have  the monopoly. "
1.0,"We cancelled our  flights and could nt book us  onto any flight for the next  10 days. I  need to spend £5k in expenses  or get us  booked with another airline. 2 months  on I am  still waiting for  answers and have  got no response to my 3  previous complaints. Even  my call centre  will tell me  the head office  had taken down  their telephone number  and email for  every department who deal with this,  and even they cannot escalate or  respond Utterly useless.
"
1.0,"Finally on our  way to Heathrow , and merely  three and a  half hours before  our scheduled departure,  we received an  envelope stating that  the flight to  Zimbabwe had been  postponed an no  explanation given. We  are then put  through the same  plane one day  earlier with no  further choice offered.  Once we were  still at the  airport we proceeded  the check in , ask what  was the cancellation  ( the pilot  is sick and  it was nobody  left on standby)  and what we  should do about . The Business  Class check-in desk  person was unsympathetic  and told us  they could not  put in our  luggage for the  next day. We  contacted someone else who told us  you could check  us in 24  hours prior to  boarding so we  waited at the  desk an further  2 hours and  turned them in,  failing which we  flew back home.  We were not  promised a refund,  only told how  we claim for  the extra expenses  required (train, change ) for the  cancelled flight to Zimbabwe, loss of  one night stay  at a very expensive safari lodge , we were  not offered anything.  Totally unprofessional, uncaring,  insensitive (lack of)  manners Avoid British  airlines and find  easier and cheaper  options"
8.0,"First flight, good  to very good  the food was  as you would expect. The aircraft  had the new  standard Business Class  and the actual  seat as not new in any since of the  time There were parts of the  cabin that were  broken or missing  but the seat  belt sat well  and worked. Seat  were also long enough to really  stretch out and  have some sleep. The video system  is great and  had plenty of  music The headphones  though were cheap  and didn't feel  they work particular good. The layout  on this 773  was a lot of business class , a lot!  we sat in  the forward cabin  when aircraft turn  right and that cabin is the quieter part of  any aircraft. The crew was very  helpful and were  present the entire time for any needs or wants  you might have . One draw back to the  cabin is as  we were traveling  in a couple the middle divider  not open enough  you really feel  that you and  your mate are  flying together. LHR  for what it  is crowded and  busy but we had a good lounge visit and  was completely on  time for all !"
1.0,"Six months have passed and still wasting my time with the BA team sharing the  wrong documents again and again. Our  departure from Delhi  to London got delayed in December 2022 so we  took the connecting flight from London Heathrow to Vancouver.  Airlines put us on a flight after 24 hours.  On reaching Vancouver , were told our baggage was  missing Such a  bad experience and their Customer Relations person did not even look into  our details already shared in December,  late April, and July. "
1.0,"In June my  booking was cancelled  in three hours of departure. Was given a rebooking the next day  when they lost my suitcase. It arrived three days  later Today - 25th August 2023 , it happened again. Offer of  payment in two  days When trying  the post a  comment the website doesn't work. Never  did BA."
4.0,"Ground and cabin  crew always provide good customer service. When it comes  to catering, Club Class has been  reduced to what Economy was. On  a BA621, the ravioli pasta had  broken out along  both edges. My slice of Camembert  looked dried- why  bother serving it? My bread roll,  with olive bread, was dry. I wonder whether anyone  on BA monitors  believes Club class has become Economy when you get  the babies and  little children in Club class.  Now it’s a glorified, soulless bus trip, without Britishness."
7.0,"My family flew  via Washington to London on a  US Airways A380, we were able  too secure seats on the upper deck for a  fairly hefty fee. Our flight was unfortunately delayed by  4 hrs from 2245 to 0120  causing us to  make a connection from Gatwick to Turin and making  it so that no lounges were open by the  time we got  at the airport.  So I sat  at a window  seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for  storing my stuff.  My flight entertainment  system didn’t work  too well, the touchscreen was disabled  and the controller  was quite glitchy and hard to  imagine it could  keep updating. The  meal for dinner  was decent, they  made pasta with  garlic sauce which tasted good by airline standards. The  flight was pretty comfortable, and the flight was smooth.  When we missed  our connection and  was stuck behind  seats for 2 hrs waiting for  it they rebooked  us on a flight from Heathrow to Milan the  same day, gave  a free bus  back to Heathrow, gave us a free hotel room,  then gave us Dinner and Breakfast , Great customer  service"
8.0,"First check in a T5. Galleries south and North lounges packed, only just able to get a seat.  Never stay long , B gates  are much quieter. Flight boarded smoothly and on time.  Large upper deck. Old club world  style which is  going to age  so little. However,  not the large  cabin on this aircraft type. Cabin ets were all fantastic. One family  experienced tech issues  with their seats  and entertainment systems  which crew worked  hard on though sadly without success. Food and drink options were all  very good. Entertainment  very good. Overall , enjoyable flight."
2.0,"Was delayed by  one hour, it 's no biggie. Had us change our gate at  JFK airport, never  been before but  I guess it's ok. Gate agent  told us to check our bags , after telling  him we would  try not to  do that, he  does it anyway. Second gate agent  changed our seats  and exit row to regular which is a huge  relief my for going travel bud.  🙂"
2.0,Many staff are  often rude and not trained properly.  The exceptions are  provided for children  and elderly people. The price of the ticket is  quite expensive given  its distance and  the service is  also extremely poor
10.0,Good domestic flight  provided by BA . Ground service  The check-in Edinburgh  gate was particularly  friendly and helpful.  Our flight departed  on time and  arrived earlier than  scheduled A complimentary  drink and snack  (£ tiny!) were  available Generally it  appears that the  operation of the  UK subsidiary is  related to the  larger British Airways .
1.0,Failed at all  the travel fundamentals: 1) Our flight  got delayed. 2) Staff demanded that  you check in  our carry on  luggage even though  we met our carry on allowance.  The fact that  you have a  fast bus connection was totally ignored.  3 Staff were  extremely unpleasant.
1.0,"They lost my baggage in a very simple situation. It's been three weeks and they  dont care, no  communications whatsoever. I  land at the  immigration checkpoint at  least 3hrs before my connecting flight,  the last leg of my trip. An agent insists on checking in my hand luggage since my plane is full. And then they lose it. I claim  luggage at the  nearest airport immediately. Now it's been three weeks, no communication whatsoever, the online status is still “Searching for your bag” with no updates. My conclusion is that the BA males no effort to find my missing bag and they don't care. "
1.0,Late boarding led to a one  full flight leaving two hours late. A single BA staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the  plane was due  the depart. There had been no previous announcement of the delay. Once on board the captain blamed Frankfurt 's staff for delaying takeoff when  their late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot.
1.0,as usual the  sale is delayed.  I try to  fault someone for the inability and incapacity of delivering  goods they sell.  Why don't you  provide enough personnel  for fulfil your  customer demand. 
10.0,"I had the most fantastic BA  flight today. The  BA crew in  the seat zone 6D were of  their best I  had experienced. Although the 777 had  some old style  of seating -  this was comfortable , felt open and spacious. BA  had done great  work with the  food - it was nice not to have to  buy breakfast food on the pre-arrival meal into HKG at 1730PM local , having left  home at 2200 the night before. The dinner offering  is equally ample and delicious. The  onboard entertainment had a great collection  on TV and  feature films and the inflight map  was first rate. Previously not a  huge BA fan  myself but after  a 12 hour  journey I could  definitely recommend it  for reserve. I flew the new  master suite in  economy class on a recent Delhi  - London flight  I enjoyed that  flight (although I  found it slightly more cramped )  and I think  BA have stepped  up with really  good bedding and food and very  knowledgeable crew who  work throughout the  flight in the  same way. Couldn't  thank BA more on this flight !"
1.0,Couldn’t book in online. Arrived at  check in to find we had been bumped off  owing to overselling. No BA staff ! Very helpful Gatwick staff got us a bus to LHR and  our flight to Toulouse. Had knock in effect on our car booking  and sharing as  the rest of  crew had been able yo board original flight. Airlines should be legally stopped from selling seats twice.
9.0,"To Heathrow to  Bombay in a  new 787-8 in  Business Class. The lounge near Terminal  A Gate B36 at Heathrow was  outstanding in its  design and offerings. It provides us just the right frame to relax  in before boarding  as the departure  was delayed by  over 2 hours.  The 787-8 on  this flight featured the older Club  Suite seating. Not  so best in  quality but comfortable . I hear that the new  Economy Suites configuration is far superior. British Airways onboard  service was outstanding  in every respect.  all in all,  all very comfortable . One minor  concern for some : this aircraft  did not fitted  for WiFi. We got into Mumbai  about 8 am,  very civilized time  to arrive."
6.0,"Keflavík, Iceland to  Edinburgh Heathrow on an A320 in  Business Class. The  flight got off  on an unpleasant  start - the  First Class line  to Keflavík was so long that  it looked like  only Economy Class . It took  over 30 mins  just get through.  There was no  wheelchair access offered.  The boarding process  seemed well handled.  Qatar Airways Business Class seats for  our Club Europe  members are terrible  - exactly the  opposite as Economy  - the middle  is left vacant.  Some don't even  get extra pitch. What made the  end product tolerable  is the good  shuttle service and  the inflight WiFi.  Plus the fact  is the flight leaves at a convenient mid-morning time  at 10:40 am."
1.0,"Terrible Experience with  BA Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had  originally planned on  leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En  route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked  some flight details  but found out that my flight  was been cancelled.  I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative  once I got to London. I  checked the BA  office and couldn't  find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I  made the mistake of requesting a . I managed  To find a flight out of  Gibraltar that got  us into London just after 10:00 , so I  booked that and then called British Airways as I  requested to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a  cancellation (they used  the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them),  they were not  going to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have  made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed.  And even when  to plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out  failed to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had  enough Avios to  pay the cost of my checked baggage, so in  my words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in  fuel and checked baggage charges to get to London  through Malaga (i.e., different airport than  which one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I  finally arrived, I  end up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put  him out and  let him drive  into the airport  or pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and  board costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate , was to  give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance  due to my out of pocket  costs Despite trying to explain to  BA why I requested the refund <mask> of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them <mask> say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation <mask> and that way they would never encounter this <mask> My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation <mask> ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club <mask> for years <mask> they simply didn't care. They said there was <mask> they could <mask> I'm sure <mask> one of <mask> BA executive's friends or family <mask> had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make <mask> right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I <mask> up my <mask> Avios and travel credit, I <mask> cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again."
1.0,An airline that  is in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is  Norwegian Airways. I  am not joking we are a  group of 7 all in Business Class heading for a Norwegian and Arctic Cruise and they lost 10 of our bags! They will never see me on any of their flights ever a disaster of an airline
2.0,"Check-in Desk rude  and dismissive. Flight  delays but seems the new norm. One world emerald, club world check-in. Staff uncommunicative, did  not know what baggage allowance entitled , once raised , became argumentative and accusatory."
1.0,"We chose British , especially because  he was going  on travel with  my niece and  sister and wanted  it to work well. What a  mistake First, it  takes me two  hours to do  my check-in online  owing to a  connection problem. I  then had to  wait more than 20 minutes in  to call to  my UK number  on my Spanish  home phone because  that the only  option they provide  is weekends. Then,  in the airport,  where there was  still boarding time,  I had to  deal with the  rest of the  airline for almost  three hours standing on the line , knowing what  was going on. They just told  everyone to wait. Finally we could  board the plane.  About 40 minutes  later they told us to leave  our plane again and told us  that flight had  gotten cancelled. We  needed to take our luggage and  waited again for  a couple of hours. Then, do  the check in  again and wait  until another flight  would take off, which was again . We spent  over 12 hours  at the airport. No information was  offered no solutions were offered. We  had to seat  at the last  row (when I  was paid to  seat on the  back half of  a plane). No  money was refunded , apologizes or compensation was given.  We also had  bad food and  we couldn’t provide  internet service. All  In all, terrible. Never again!"
1.0,"I booked Premium  flights from INV to LAX (via LHR). They notified  ME of a cancelled flight on  my return journey , rebooked me  on a flight  which my connecting flight arrived too  late for! Then they cancelled a  flight on my  return to LAX!  And then cancelled  my rebooked flight  for the return journey and rebooking  it back on  the first flight  - they had  placed me on - the flight  that I have  a chance of  booking as my return flight arrives too late into . They re-routed  me from LAX to JFK to  cancel - which  I would have accepted - but they booked the  flights in Economy  flight to JFK)  with my husband (6'4"" with a  knee injury) -  to do and  now they won't  accept it -  Even though they have a direct flight from LAX  into LHR with  Premium Economy and  the flight allows  for 54 mins  to transfer flights  from JFK -  meaning my husband  would be able  able walk slowly,  let alone quickly, after enduring the  cancelled flight from LAX to LHR.  They have chatted  repeatedly to have my calls disconnected and I also  had online chat  which proves I  will not accept  a re-routed flight  at JFK but  they won't budge."
1.0,"A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really  did happen to  me My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel  from London City  airport to Frankfurt.  Before we purchased the tickets, I  mistakenly entered my  surname twice (e.g.  as John Smith and Ms John ). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost  me over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told  their was no way to change the name (apparently  you can only  change 3 letters  when there has  be a typo?) and I had  no other option to purchase the  last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the  plane - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original . Zero empathy  being shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the  knowledge that there was apparently no  possible way we could board the  flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased  this ticket I  contacted BA's 'Commercial  Guest Booking Team' and informed them  of our situation.  A service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me  a partial refund then, advising me  how I had a claim to the difference and  we should contact Customer Support to  do so. I  told this person  numerous times I  needed to claim the cost of  my new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could  refund the difference.  True enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for  the difference. Two days later, British  Air Customer Response informed us that  they were unable to lodge a  claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before  our flight'. They've continued to send  me emails until  next week, when they just stopped responding. So in  effect British Airways  lied and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me  going at night thinking how they can do this  and get away with it so  easily"
4.0,"This was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving . There was  no announcement to  passengers of the delay nor were the sceens updated.  Once ready to board we were  asked to take  our seats quickly  and help reduce  the delay, which  I did. The  pilot then announced he had received  the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had  to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this  got resolved, the  controller announced there would be a  delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing  everyone sit quickly, we sat the  other aircraft at  a gate for  over one hour,  which is longer than the flight  time ! Of course AMS is  our BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it  will require a  higher level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way. It’ll be Eurostar for me next time."
8.0,"Easy and friendly check in (total  contrast to Gatwick). The contract lounge is comfortable and  spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after  having one free  case of wine. Food best avoided.  Full board, great  food and dinner was actually good , and substantial  apart from the ""chocolate and orange  bar that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought  into the global stock? The crew  were always ready  for top up , although white wine and beers  remain lukewarm. The crew explained that  the carts are  meant to be chilled - from  which they rarely  do Is dry ice so expensive  that BA can't  provide it?"
2.0,"I don't understand  that British Airways  gets classified as  only 4 star . The service  seems really mediocre.  Their food is  bland and insufficient for a long  term trip. Some  members of the  cabin crew are  nice but they  are not attentive , and create  the very basic experience. This really  says all about  getting from point  A to B  minus what it  needs to be  an enjoyable trip  taking experience. The  live entertainment is  really good, but  you do need  you bring your  own water not to get dehydrated,  have snacks and  good food and  to smile to  yourself as otherwise  they are faced  to just a  few personality less . "
2.0,"I'm sure that BA have gradually  made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer  out of Gatwick) so miserable that  many are tempted  by upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class.  We wait at  BA biz checkin  (+ due to status ) and  spoken with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on  clipping fingernails. Lounge was crowded and  loud but at  times the staff there are pleasant and helpful On  arrival the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two  hours before crew  returned with food sales and the ""free water"" which  some Gatwick services  consist of a half full plastic cup rather than  the luxury of  one small bottle.. A fellow passenger  mentioned the delay and the fact  the they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted  the flight attendant  to say that the service was  actually better on  those who do two service runs ."
1.0,"Bad Service does  indeed exist. One  British emerald, frequent  long haul flyer  ( BA) -  never seen such  poor customer service  - “computer says "". Official BA.com site said all  night and afternoon that flight from  Houston delayed 2  hrs Delayed leaving  Newark airport -only  telling BA to  come back to  local time. Called  flight customer service 1.5 hours prior  to highway saying  no - told  Not to worry,  make note and  be rebooked if  needed but go to airport. Got  to airport 40 mins prior told  could not board  and that staff  does not work  for BA so could not help.  Called on phone,  2 hours in total to be told could be  delayed then couldn’t  come round and  cancelled Ultimately told to file complaint. Then found out  plane left 2  hours delayed. Paid  4 extra hotels , with more  private airlines and now told 38 mins wait for complaints to be  attended to - heavens help economy , non-status flyers if that’s what  happens front end  for the plane ."
9.0,"A really great pair of flights, on time, no  problems at all,  flight was ok and my meal  plans were great, the new club  seats is a good improvement over the previous seat,  best flight entertainment  I have been  amazing can’t wait  t fly with  him again and  enjoy another great  flight"
1.0,"Our A380 developed a fault taxiing  onto the runway - we returned  to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3  hrs later due to a technical fault. All the while, BA staff  being virtually non-existent, it was finally  a captain who announced the flight was cancelled. BA  found an alternative  for next day  for a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport,  Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520  refund out of  BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact , as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline  that might at least care less about their customers.  Highly recommended. "
2.0,Horrible airline. Does nt care about their customers. Used  to be decent but has now since really fell off. A flight time of 5 hours and 30  mins but no  snacks while the  cabin attendants were having their eggs  & sausage in  their back? Didn't  they offer juices. I would stick with another airline.
4.0,"My family and  I have flown  BA on British  Airlines for the  next 30 years. I am a  regular passenger and  arrive often enough  to recognise cabin  crew and know  people by name.  BA used to  become a really  friendly airline to  deal with. Things  have really deteriorated  with their face  to face customer  experience since the  beginning The aircraft  has worn. For  once on my  journey back my audiovisual equipment did  no work and  required to be  replaced twice, finally  again in the  final hour before  we landed. The  third time around,  I think the  same was done  for the whole  flight The touch pad function on  a screen did  not work. The  battery charger ports  in my seat  did not work.  The staff were  nice enough, but  customer service oozed  rubbish  There  does not seem  too be much  care in what  people were doing. The food has  been the worst  quality on our  BA flights since  flu pandemic. They  brought us a  and asked what  it like, did  our check and  politely told us  no it was  still available as  we had run  out and would  you like to  try something else.  He then told  us that we’d  get first choice  of the second  option which they  will deliver on.  Even after choosing  and getting whatever  it is that  we did, the  food was tasteless.  They take part  on post flight  counselling regularly and  have stated all  over this, to  little avail. As  the family of  three we fly  UK Airways medium  and long haul  flights possibly 4-6 x a year ! For us,  two good things  of flying BA are that we  are priority customers,  we have a  fast flight to  their destinations and  receive good service  from the ground,  including checking in and in the  cockpit when we  want them."
2.0,"This has been by far the worst service I have had on  any plane. It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open  our check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the  line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon  due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. Once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and  we couldn't leave the boarding area. I will never fly this airline again! "
2.0,"In Nov 2022 I booked and paid for a return journey to New Zealand. On my return journey my final flight was from London  to Edinburgh. On trying to check in I was told my ticket  did not exist’.  BA showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a . My only option was to  book a ticket  for a later flight which cost £265.07. Since Nov . ie, 8 months ago, I have communicated multiple times with BA  with an attempt  and have my money returned. They have admitted responsibility  for their error which cost me £265. I finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of £32.14. I have asked  them an explanation but have received none, only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was  made and was  that I do not intend to  letting this matter go. A company worth billions of pounds will not  give an honest refund. PS, they also lost my  luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it. I tracked it down myself a week later to Edinburgh airport and picked it up myself."
4.0,It is not treating its premium  class passengers with . You pay  you a premium  for service and  were then compelled  you use the  private toilets at  one back of  a plane. This  is short-changing passengers.  ®
1.0,"24 hours before our departure on  Monday to Cape Town from Heathrow  last Thursday 29th June, we did  the online check-in.  Two had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F  seats which are the middle two seats of the  middle block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and  jumping in and  outs of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet  can mean climbing over a person  on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got  into Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried  to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer  up an upgrade to Premium Economy , at 450GBP  but it was  beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the  ground crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was  sitting shoulder to  chest between by wife and a  woman with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours  I suffered. When  I did manage to get out  to our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on  our aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening  meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when  eating especially for  any older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow  on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure. The  seats are wide  but there is  ample legroom. If they can do it, then why  cannot British Airways."
1.0,"We arrived at  JFK at 0600 , find our flight to Ibiza  being cancelled by  BA with no explanation. As if  that wasn’t galling enough, the customer  assistance from BA at the airport was non-existent! There  were no explanation, no apology and  zero assistance in  arranging an alternative flight. We’ve managed to find another  alternative from Stansted  airport that isn’t  departing much later today, thus wasting a chunk of our short trip. I simply don’t  know why BA don’t proactively contact  their customers to notify them of  a cancellation, and work with them  to resolve the problem. Shocking customer  service"
3.0,Original flight was cancelled with no  response There was no representative to help in rebooking We had to  call customer service (long distance call)  phone line kept dropping Had to do 40 +  searches to find  alternate booking only to discover the only way I could fly the  same day was  for paying business class. No help  Finding hotel for the night stay.
3.0,"Airport check in  very functionary with little warmth but some efficiency. Flight was delayed with  no communication given. Boarding was chaotic  and no management of the process by ground staff.  Controls on board are tight and  you really feel like they have  been in every  way possible. There is next to no recline. However  one was thankful that there was no recline. If the person in  charge had even the slightest recline they would be in my face  due to how tight the seats were spaced on  an A321 aircraft. No amenities on  that flight except for a toilet that was clean  and small. No IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff  was friendly. Luggage  arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time."
10.0,Flight fine. In-line  to competitors. Pleasant ! Only niggle is bussed to and from aircraft  in Heathrow. It seems like this is standard for the Berlin flights.  Could use again.
1.0,"Fly from Glasgow to London and took connecting flight American Airlines from  London to North  Charleston It's my third day here in North Carolina , still waiting  for my luggage.  I didn't even bother to transfer the luggage to connecting flight. Luggage are still in  transit "
1.0,"My flight on on 12 May  2019 got delayed an hour and 25 minutes which resulted in the  delay of our  second flight on  12 May 2023  because the arrival  from the first flight was only  seconds before the departure of the second connecting flight. We contacted the  flight call center multiple times to make changes to  our flight in  time to still  travel on the  13 of May  in KEF airport  with different flights.  My team tried to find a  compromise but none made sense, not  least on the  same day the 13th of May ! We have made full booking  of accommodation, car  and activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The  balance of of  the booking is  not refundable. The  calling center suggested  if we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and  cancel of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all,  even though we  paid additional $600  of new bookings and additional charges. The refund of  my cancelled flight  took more than  one month with multiple calla to follow up almost  each week. I was promised to  a refund on the first call but later I found out it  had not processed properly. Every-time I  call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which  became annoying when  not understanding everything was under process  and payment. After  several calls I  got refunded partially , not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company  of this level.  I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded.  This whole experience  felt terrible."
2.0,"This is a 5 hour flight and BA considers  it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees  lined up against  a seat in  front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a  TV - which is now available by WiFi that you have to  charge for. You  need to pay for your seat  - checked in  - food & drink, WiFi. Not  because I have anything against that , I'm used to that on budget airlines -  but this is  still a premium  class ticket. I would have preferred to fly on  Emirates where the  base ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been  twice the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the  cheapest ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer  service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where  people use the back row or  sit and talk  - without any  consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the  hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference  in the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for  passengers It is also poorly served  for transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have  become a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card  Holder at one point - so  you know about  this potential experience. I used be  able to make  a choice -  do I fly  cheaper or do  you fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a  matter of flying  cheaper or flying  cheaply for double the price with BA. "
1.0,"After travelling London to Madrid with  British Airways, then  through Iberia from  London to Lima  and LATAM to Cuzco, my luggage  arrived 7 days  with me. When  attempting to collect my luggage, mine  is the only  one not to . I sought  assistance and was informed to make  a claim online.  When my bag  finally arrived 7  days later, the  bags had been  cut open and  everyone inside the  bag searched. Someone  took my 1st aid kit and  backpack and threw  some clothing about,  and felt violated.  We have been  humiliated appallingly from  beginning to finish.  For a month,  i have been  to and forth  with British Airways,  but they stated  it is not  our fault. "
1.0,"MY luggage was mis-tagged in Dallas on my way  to Cairo via  Bring My Luggage  delivery at LHR  was planned on Saturday 6/24. However, upon arrival due to the luggage  getting mis-tagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage, it was never sent to Cairo. Its sitting  in Terminal 3  at LHR (I  had an air tag on my ) and British  Airlines is saying there is nothing they can do about it. I have filed 3 claims, made 13 phone calls, have been hung up on 3x and  as simple as it is to solve this problem , workers at BA refuse to  address the problem. "
1.0,"This airline lost  the luggage and  looked absolutely awful throughout the entire  trip They gave  you no updates, their website sucks,  and it was  nearly impossible to  reach someone on the phone. They  never delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to  go back to  the US, 5 days after I  told them to ship it back  to the US.  So I’ve been  up everyday begging them to get my bag back  to me. They appease me on the phone, tell  them they’re fixing it, but nothing changes. The hotel  cant get in  contact with them  and they haven’t  even tried to pick to bag back up. Several times, when I  called I got a message saying they were not  working due to too many complaints and calls and  said “call back "". "
1.0,"We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class.  My first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with  vague explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of  20 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service  saying that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except  for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund. We will not use the credits - we were fully refunded by our travel insurance."
2.0,First time flying with BA business  and never again. There are no boarding drinks provided.  My meal quality was below business  class standards as was the quality of the wine. On arrival at Bodrum my bags  are among the last to appear.  Im looking forward  doing the same  experience on the  new flight. 
4.0,"You can buy  bread and crisps but don't expect  a hot meal.  As the plane is a narrow  one , there  were no screens.  Not helping matters  is the fact  that the BA  gift shop for  food didn't recognise the flight number, and the onboard  free WiFi didn't work. "
7.0,"This is a  travel review covering  Economy and business  seats on the  same flight from London City to  Birmingham Economy was : A very  light lunch (small ish sandwich, chocolate ), followed by  my pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was  slow but the  attendants worked hard  & did a  really good job.  This is a flight I would  recommend Except, don't  go for the last minute offer  on an upgrade to business for  seating in each  seat as I  did (I flew  straight out and business back, while my brother flew  business then economy.)  My business seats  look identical to  Economy with no  windows blocked, so  you are squished  in four abreast. The meals are  also identical, with  some tweaks such  a a yoghurt for your £100.  Your only real  difference is Champagne.  Also on my flight, there was  champagne because of  technical issues"". The  gate attendant (I  think his name  is Tom) must  be one of  the best in  the business. I  cannot eat, so  he paid £100 for nothing. Oh ! So great , but stick  to economy."
1.0,"Absolutely horrible airline.  Website is terrible. Last minute delays,  no seat changes  & no communication. App and website  customer experience is years behind other airlines. Seats are  crowded and uncomfortable.  I Would not  go again."
1.0," Having experienced delays , cancellations departing  for USA to  Europe and now  the 3.5 hour estimated delay at LHR heading back  into USA, I  strongly warn travelers : BA has  become unreliable and  its now on  the “Do Not Fly list until  things get better . "
7.0,"Travelled to Heathrow , Kalamata and  return journey 11  hours later. World  Class (aka Economy)  flight Both flights departed on time.  The flight landed  fine - BUT , we then  faced a 1  ½ hour wait  in the baggage  to be offloaded  - rather ruined  my journey home  because we then  caught a motorway . Flights OK , FA's (particularly  on return flight)  Fair enough. But,  as usual, Economy  Class seating was  simply dreadful -  no legroom at  all No better  in Club class  seating - only  one middle seat  for free. Marked  off because of  - Can only  sit if you  are not tall."
1.0,"This flight failed  on every level.  we were delayed  and arrived at our destination late  so that our  hire car transfer  had to advise  us that he  might only wait  about 10 minutes for us but this was a  cancelled holiday. We  only ordered food  for our flight and this was  all loaded onto  the flight and  we finally compound British Airways complete  or utter uselessness  my luggage was still in Heathrow.  As there is no flight tomorrow , earliest this  flight could possible  get is very  late on Wednesday ! Having only  bought clothes that you flew in  after reading you  had only claim for toiletries and  this seems to  me the antithesis of a happy holiday. I might have expected a  chocolate scone in  spite of no  bread but no  and were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they  had available. I  should like to  make it clear  that we are  the airways bronze  medal holders which as we have  now long retired  shows how we 've used this airline historically."
1.0,"Beware of British  Airways and their  attempts to make  people believe that  you are full  business class and  even above the  rest They won't  give you that  way when you  were bumped from  a flight and it is their  job to compensate you for their  error We recently  took a trip  we planned from MRS to SEA.  Our mechanical issue  ensured that we departed late from MRS to LHR  and we needed to make a  connecting flight. We  arrived with plenty  of time to  made it to  the next gate, but a series  technical issues and choices by British  Airlines kept us from boarding our  connecting plane. The  airline did not  send off passengers  on connecting flights first nor did they hold the  last flight for  the mere 5-10  minutes for passengers to make connections  to their airlines.  Then we discovered  later we had actually been bumped  to our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to  the Atlantic to  figure out how to get us home. It extended  my travel day  by 8 hours!  You were traveling with children as  well No offers of compensation or  refunds were made. And now BA  are refusing to  give us any financial compensation. We  paid for a  flight home with  not one connection and instead had  two connections, multiple  airlines to deal  and security through an extra airport , kids for  that midnight flight we were never  allowed on. That  was not what  I paid for  and BA refuses to make it !! So beware potential travelers!"
2.0,I flew from Cairo to Heathrow on what they  call euro club  flight which is a cramped coach  car with the  odd empty seat.  Poor service. I get to Heathrow  airport 40 minutes late so I  have to run  everywhere looking for  a connecting flight. Finally jumping through escalators and train  to another building where is my  luggage Given a  seat that is different than what  they paid extra  in ?! It’s a shame for such well known .
1.0,"We flew with numerous airlines, but I gotta admit, British Airways is  so far the  worst airline ever when it comes to customer support.  We waited 3 weeks for a  ticket change. Call  desk workers are  giving you false information just so  it would make  you hang up. They told me  he was supposed  I get an email from them with the flight  change but never . They don't have a live  website just like  Southwest Airlines do,  they don't have  an online form  for submit your questions, they don t have a  direct international number.  Just garbage."
3.0,"We were traveling as a family (5 people). Because of an accident by the airport, we arrived at the airport only  one hour before the flight. The kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to check-in. The lady at the check-in checked the passport , gave us a boarding pass. Because we had no extra time,  I headed straight to security and  I realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass (not of the passport holder). We got stuck in security because of that, couldn’t  work out what was wrong. We only didn’t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with  our 70 year  olds and a 9 year old included in the party. The staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there."
1.0,Flying at 8.40am from DUB to LCY cancelled 1155pm night before. No  phone message. No ? Waiting at  last stop and randomly checked email  and see alternate  route option. Hang . What’s this!  I was dark at 5am. It  was hard to  call mobile phone  and I’m still  jet lagged. Only  plan was to  call at 9.20am.  No calling. No  answer there. So accepted it. But I didn’t see the day change!  That was the next day! I didn’t want the  flight (as was staying at Docklands !) choosing LCY but thought I better take it as it’s leaving  one hour after  your original flight. Nope. I better  try to say  how sorry I  messed up. Your  flight is not going to work  on me. I  barely have any  other accommodation in  England and I  really want to  have one night  to London. Called.  The most surly  airport service (can  it even be called that when  people treat people like this) answered.  And kept calling me James (not  my name). She  is brutal. You accepted it. I can’t do anything.  You basically made  myself feel like  the moron because  in a moment 's confusion I  chose the first  scheduled flight from  a stupid supercomputer.  You kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen.  Now if you  only called us we could have  put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She  wanted to charge  you 600 pounds in new flights  and change fees.  Just said nope and booked a  flight today with  Emirates Plus I  have to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands.  More money from  them because of  the utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they  really do some  stupid stuff. But never this level of cruelty because of one simple  thing Never again.  When do people  display such utter  ignorance and ineptitude? Welcome to the  Jungle Just wow.
1.0,* I have  booked twice with them this year  for business class and they have  experienced significantly delayed or cancellations with  my flights. The  poor service or  the lack of it is appalling  it has forced  us to change  my cards as I no longer  wish to use BA for any  longer flights. Terrible  looking old planes  with miserable staff. </s>
1.0,The customer service  is ugly. Tried calling two weeks ago but still had problems with flight. All I get is someone in India. I thought i was flying Iberia once  I looked close at ticket it 's British Airways. Will never fly  an Airway ever again.
3.0,"Most uncomfortable flight  you have ever  flown It's a long time since I have flown  and the cramped conditions were awful. The rows were so close together  that the person  in front reclined  the seat my TV was so close I couldn't focus on it.  Somehow BA seem to want to  offer economy so  as to encourage customers to upgrade,  this has not worked on me, I will avoid flying BA in future. My onward flight was with LATAM, same 787 aircraft but more room between rows, far more comfortable. On the return flight from Santiago the lights were  completely down at  times I feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service, they just disappear behind the curtains."
1.0,"we booked our  way out of  town trip to take my husband  to a surprise  vacation to Monaco.  BA gave us  only 3 hours  between our connecting  flight to and  our home through . Our flight  departed Seattle an hour late causing  we to miss  our connecting flight.  We were rescheduled , we even  arrived They booked  me on a  flight 7 hours  earlier and offered  no food tickets  and any other  kind of reimbursement.  Then we sat  in their customer  services line for  a hour and  the half to  see if they  could rebook us  for an earlier  plane to watch  BA continually assist  other customers that  showed up outside  of the queue  as earlier flights  became available). When  they arrived in  Paris France the  line was closed,  including the rental  assistance desk. We  were not offered  further assistance from  either airline on  a room or  other accommodation for  a night. We  called a cab,  that cost us  50 euros one  hour to get  from our hotel.  we thought there  was no way  anything like this  could happen on  your way home….we  thought wrong. Our  plane from Nice  at Heathrow was  30 minutes late,  With a 2.5  hour layover you  may think we  would still make  that flight, unfortunately  the security lines  caused over 1.5  hour further delay.  On arriving BA  closed the doors , said they  would not hold  this plane any  longer despite arriving  hours before departure.  After running through  to Heathrow airport  then going through  security again. They  put us back  in the customer  services queue, where  their first statement  is we can’t  fly you out  till tomorrow. After  which they found  out a flight  to another airline.  By that time  we were told  the bags were  related to our  flight with Delta.  They were given  2 pounds each  for snacks at  the airport for  our now additional  2 hour delay.  The total for  our trip there  from home we  travelled 13 hours  at Heathrow airport  from our original  planned layover of  4 hours, and we were offered  one pound each.  Then the drama ? The two  claimed that they  still made the  next flight, shockingly  had not. We  were told that  we had the file the claim  to Delta, since  that last part  of our flight  were with them.  I have now  been home for  4 days and  neither airline is  pointing the finger  to the other. As I said  for both of  you today. I  dont care who’ s my bags  sort it out  and send me  your luggage I  also want your $500 reimbursement per  day as that  would come close  with the memories  and stuff that  you have in  me I will  NEVER fly British  Columbia again, and  our baggage people  do not doing <mask> either."
4.0,My husband and  myself booked seats  through our premium economy booking. On  the outward journey BA015 on 12 February and return on 11 March  we were last OR almost last  to be served . Each time they had run out of our choices. On one occasion I did not eat as  only available option was curry which disagrees with me. On all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry/spicy ! All in  one very disappointing  experience left us with a very poor opinion of  BA Airways.
1.0,"July 3, flew  from Seattle to  London then to  Boston BA lost  my golf bag  that caused me  to purchase golf  and club rentals,  and balls. I  booked tee times  on two courses  in St. Andrews  that took months  the make. The  time my bag  arrived in 24 hours and they  would reimburse occurred , I contacted  Walmart and they  said they would  also reimburse toiletries.  Then the return  trip home was  randomly canceled by  Delta without notifying  them or without  informing two weeks  before the scheduled  departure I contacted  a corporate travel  agency they informed me BA, canceled  my return reservation.  Then rebooked me  on the same flight. BA customer  care was horrendous  to make false  claims I will  NEVER use this  service again. Beware  of British Airways.  BA also randomly  flew my girlfriend  for her fathers  birthday and they  were both gold ."
2.0,"I went through three flights to  get my destination.  Two of my  3 flights without  incident were delayed,  all on my way to my  hotel and back from my destination  which is understandable to an extent. What's not understandable is that they  were prepared for one of the  delays and delayed  it almost an hour so I  end up missing  a flight and for that they rebooked me 24h  after providing only  room which they  set up as  free and after  four hours of traveling I had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since BA didn't  communicate properly with . I gave  BA a chance  of correct their  errors by contacting them after the flights but all they did was  respond once with  a lot of  the complaints that  were involved with  the flights and  what they did was tell me  they contact their partners that I had the last  meeting with, which went smoothly and they had nothing  too do with the previously addressed  issues I contacted them and gave  them over a  call asking why  BA didn't address any of my  concerns that their partner could have  had to do  so and they  just ghosted me.  Sorry for the  airline personnel that's holding this airline  together though."
9.0,"Very excellent flight in Club World on British Airways. The welcome aboard  started warm and that continued throughout the flight. The  staff were attentive, friendly and very  welcoming On board food for dinner  and breakfast was good and there was a well  stocked selection of wines. In flight  we offered a  good selection of  entertainment and audio. The seat/flat bed  were very comfortable - British Airways  have done an excellent job in the design and  construction of the suites on board the A350. I  enjoyed the sleek, minimalist design. This  flight showed that  British can be among the world’s  top airlines."
3.0,"The flight schedule was delayed for  an hour. After boarding the plane we were delayed at least another 30 minutes. When we arrived in London, we were delayed again for at least another 30 minutes to find a gate. We were left with 45 minutes only to catch  a connecting flight  in Barcelona, we needed to run and take the  train to different terminal to catch  a next connecting flight. When we arrived at Barcelona airport, we discovered that our check in luggage was still in London.  A painful trip  during our vacation).  not flying with BA anymore if I can find alternative Airlines. "
1.0,"The worst experience in all my  years of travel. My first flight  in my two  flights from Boston to London was delayed by 2 hours, resulting in  nearly missing my  return flight. Despite  having a layover of approximately 2.5 hours, I ended  in waiting until 4.30 pm to board my flight  for Cairo. Unfortunately, even that flight was delayed. I would strongly advise avoiding this particular airline, even if it means paying a bit more for a different option."
1.0,"The worst experience  in all my years of travel.  Food was destroyed, flight delayed 3  days and couldn't  put water on ! Then when  attempting to claim  off their website , entire site  is on a  new menu that  would work. You  can contact them. Plane was filthy  with someone else's  hands and left  and food was  left in our  seats"
2.0,Flight delays. Had  someone rebook our  international travel for 5 passengers and  not received any  refund on the  flights Lost all  the luggage; received  refund after 4  days Had to  buy new clothes for the family  to a wedding.  No customer service rep picks up  my phone.
10.0,A serious medical  condition appeared while I was onboard.  We informed the crew and they helped me out. Unfortunately I was in transit but  traveling further became too difficult because of how unwell I became. Also I could not find my way back home in my condition. Thankfully  the crew has helped me in  every step of the journey until I returned back home. It was a stressful experience  and the crew  of British Airways  make it way more tolerable.
1.0,"I haven't flown British Airways before , will never  fly them again!  The check-in process was terrible and slow. There were over 30 people  in the regular  flight in line and they had  three agents working it. They had one agent working  the first class !! It should not take that long to check people in especially when people should  get checked in  well ahead of time. Our group checked in online and almost missed our plane because  o the slow counter service. We had to run to the gate and we did make it, but  lines were terrible!"
1.0,"My itinerary was  suppose to be  Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When  I landed in London Heathrow, I  sat stuck on  an aircraft for 2 hours with  no explanation as  for why and  because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the  plane was when  my real nightmare  took place. Our  airline had over  300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush  or get to  other flights or  have already missed  the flight. They  forced us into  2 lines, one  among them being  two people who  missed their flight.  I waited approximately  45 minutes just  to come up to a clerk  who told me ""Since I missed  my flight I would have to  head to the connecting flight BA  service desks for further assistance."" If  I were to  have known that was the only  route I would  take I would  have skipped being  on that line altogether. When I  arrived to the  boarding desk where  they were more than 60+ people  already in line,  everyone waited 30+  mins until a  man came by  giving everyone a pamphlet telling people  should create an account online and to book our  flights through the BA site since  their systems were  broken and couldn't  contact anyone. It  was a hassle doing anything through he BA site  and I ended  by calling the  company After waiting  and be connected  by a BA  agent I spoke  to a woman who said I  would have to  contact Iberia Airlines for a rebook,  i called Iberia and they said since I booked  on Expedia I  will have to call them. Expedia  also said I would have to call BA for  a rebook so  when I called BA again, the  rep said the only flight he  could get me  connected for was  for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling  because the 25th  which was a  Friday All the  airports in the vicinity of the  hotel were booked,  everyone was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I  just don't have  and most of  the customer service I got from  BA reps was  half service as  if they could care less for  the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing  myself with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport  wait for my flight the next  day because hotels  where booked. Overall  my experience with  BA Airlines has  probably the worst  booking experience I've ever had to  deal with. I will never book  from this company , I would rather pay more money for a  ticket in a  foreign airline than buy through this company again."
9.0,"Last day at LHR and flight full. Lounge crowded but B gates  were quieter. Flight left on time,  very professional crew,  recognized by name and executive club status acknowledged and  cleared for return custom. A nice touch. Service was good. Food average. Entertainment good. Early arrival, quick processing at JFK. All good."
2.0,"Best seats I  have ever encountered  in economy class.  NO leg room at all. I  tried to spread  the legs to  find Staff at the terminal rude. “Business class” offers  that same seat,  only with more  space and they  fill the middle ? They cram  people in seats with no legroom  to block off  this same seat  right at the  front of the  row (where there is more legroom)  – so the  first class” passenger  leaves an empty  spot between them.  Everything is old  and no onboard  amenities for a  6 hours flight.  First time I  would fly British  Airlines"
1.0,"Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on  several different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines  I fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on  notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used  this to travel  around Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with  this airline in years. When you  try hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company.  Everyone I am  sure makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after  I booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT AGE TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when  someone finally answered.  Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer  services number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What  airline operates 365  days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel  the flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you  are the primary,  you may or  might not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8  – The flight may be cheaper,  usually it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10  – If you  take a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my <mask> is done."
10.0,We check in on the way  to Heathrow. The  journey was on  schedule with no issues. Our return flight to Valencia  was booked for  the afternoon and our long haul  flights arrived early  in Heathrow. This  came with another airline and was not a connecting  flight I asked  at the British  Airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight  directly to Valencia  or avoid seven hours waiting at  customs We had  our flights changed  for no cost  but were checked in within five  minutes That is  great customer service. Thank you.
10.0,"The check in worked fine. Quick security check. Once onboard quick flight  direct to Glasgow,  shower and snack ! All in  All very pleased.  All quick and efficient."
2.0,"– The BA  departure lounge at  Terminal 5 was  a zoo at  with dirty tables , used tableware everywhere. Worse than  that the usual  delayed boarding gate , and boarding  being 50 mins late. The flight  is operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely  below cost standard  stand alone business  - Hard, thin,  narrow seats, poor legroom and the  cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that  airlines allow this,  and it's time  for BA's CEO and management focused  towards standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff  is fundamentally courteous,  but they provide  the very trimmed  down budget airline  customer service, as  the whole trip turned out to  be - and  for this business  class ticket was  one of the  more expensive on recent trips. I  understand post Covid ent BA were  there for a  six months, but  for many cost  reductions they are making, they fall  well below all  other European full  Service Airlines. "
4.0,"Just a quick  return to Nice  Airport from Heathrow.  Had to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. I paid over £300  in a business class round trip.  It went into  BA to BA  Lounge in Terminal 5 which was  very crowded. Being  earlier in the morning I decided  on having a  drink and stuck  for the breakfast . The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was  quite enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a  much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there  about 40 mins.  Staff was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was  spread out, which acted as an  observation table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the  standard seating in  Business but there may have been  an additional inch  more leg room. I think that BA are trying  and outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with  the complimentary newspaper  they read during  their flight. The  Express magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there 's zero in  way of in flight entertainment. The  cabin WiFi was flaky at best  and non-existent at other times. I  was glad it  was only a two hour flight.  I really do not think the  flight that we  got was worth the money"
2.0,"Words fail to  remember this last  long flight -  sitting across the  plane crying for  much of the  flight and although  having to go without any rest for the long  flight LHR/SFO, it's  difficult for a  flight to cry  about - but  with crew yakking  on in the  cabin even after a polite notification  of their conversation  cannot be heard  by the cabin  - that made the flight unbearable  without any rest ful sleep (always  better anyway westbound).  the food was  really bad that  I  turned  down whatever the nasty offering was  for the 2nd ! What happened to the really  great tea and  tea I've said  this before after suffering through the  whole concept of customer service (i.e.  please do anything  to help the  customer if it involves any extra work) - this  is i swear i mean it  - never again  - BA please!  The lounge was  jammed packed even  the single traveler  having a hard time finding a  table - poor  plane is on  its skids downhill."
1.0,"Absolutely terrible experience.  The app would not let me check in online  but repeatedly asked for COVID documents, but then did  never accept them even when provided. I was trying  my fly back  from the USA, where I am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors. I  called to British Airways Customer Service to check in and was told that my seat was already given  out to another  customer even though I was there  with plenty of time. This was  all during an industrial action at  airports meaning the  number of flights were limited. I was delayed over  two hours in  returning to the USA, all because of their terrible  system and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when  another paid passenger is already there  in the airport."
1.0,BA overbook every flight to maximise their income with  no regard for the customer. It means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even  with no luggage.  But easyJet and  Emirates look like customer champions. The  girl in Itsu  in the BA  Airport says she  quit flying BA  long ago due  to the service being bad all the time. Most  passengers she serves  as a complaint Staff don't care as poor service  and unhappy customers is a routine  occurrence
1.0,"Both flights were  all on time,  excluding Belfast from  Manchester which never is. The Staff  were efficient. My  disappointment is the  fact I could  to book seats  in Tel Aviv  but tried for  a month as  opposed to pay. So ended up  on a middle  ground even though  a window seat  is available on the flight. The  lounge was in  breach of the  security barrier and  then used as  well by the  PR team throughout  the flight so  I wasted my  money on PE ! You can  keep hold of BA customer service via the app either and they  basically just ignored  any other communication so just won't  use them again."
3.0,"Only the second time flying BA  and first time  very positive. Could  of made my connection in Heathrow if BA had been proactive. Instead,  stayed at the  cheapest hotel compliments of BA. Adequate, but one wonders why a large  part of this  airline is devoted  towards sleeping and feeding of hundreds  other stranded passengers. If BA had  sent one employee to help us  back to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which  were a half hour late arriving,  we could have made our flight  and saved BA  the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations. Another bad show. Business  class fare should offer more."
3.0,"I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After  arriving our flight  were reduced from  Economy to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg . First to make up for  the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we  checked in online  to our chosen window seats, at  departure gate we had to show our passports as  our passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to  board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew  for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. I say this as the new club suites are great."
1.0,"We booked business class tickets for  my fiancé and  realized I had  to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing , so I  needed to get  onto my flight . The representative  over the phone  assured me he  not sure how  long I would  receive as the refund department needed  to check, but  that I would  owe 10-20% of  a booking to  insure I accepted. I never got  the cancellation email,  or any update,  I instead received  the total back.  Less than 1%  of my booking costs. Since then  we have spent  about 5 hours  calling different departments  which they blocked  so I've lost  a tremendous amount  more money with  nothing to show."
1.0,"I will never travel with British  Airlines again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to  see a funeral in the UK.  Unfortunately the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are  small and effectively  have a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these  seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and  they have to clamber over others  to go to  the toilet, which  wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business  economy is that  people pay to rest and have  dinner and not have someone push  across the top of you. Second,  their food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I  can not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for  3 hours and I had to pay more (no  international airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a  tiny plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it 's not one piece. This means  that you are  seated on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult  too injury I now find that  my flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book  a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats ! This is  how I got the worst seat  in the house  cleaned out. This is the most  awful airline service I have ever . There is no point paying for business class in British Airways. "
1.0,"I am already in Portugal so  called them today and they cancelled  a return flight because I was 10 minutes late calling them, even  when I tried  over 2 hours to get through  a day before.  Now I am  trying to get  through and they have kept the  10 pounds. Customer service is shocking,  we have no  way of helping you."
1.0,– Avoid this ! It’s now  the regular practice  of cancel flights.  Take a cancellation  from Switzerland that  forces us to  spend the whole  day in a  cheap hotel and  have to fly  back the next  country and then  get another cancellation  to Spain. The  airline only knows  who to ask  about expensive prices.
2.0,"Despite being a  staff member, the  US Airways staff  in Heathrow literally  does not care  for the slightest  for the absolute  financial and logistical  conditions or wider  implications of their  own service. All  other staff members  have the same  statement - “we  were not obliged to provide even  an update for  our first 24  hours as if  this would make  the situation better.  There are no  status updates, no  or no care "", a lot  more actual lies  were told. You  can tell that  staff have given  barely any care  and thought for  treating passengers as  individual individuals -  they show this  through every action  every word they  make All of  whom are better  used to working  separately from other ."
5.0,"About the aircraft  Economy seat: The  business class seats  on this flight  were pretty good.  These were of  a suite type, where every seat  had its own  area with sliding  curtains for extra privacy. The downside  of this is that if you are travelling as  one couple, its  quite difficult to  relax There is  no storage and  no charging ports.  The seat is  quite comfortable. As  one who finds  it very difficult  on sleep on  planes this was  1 of the  few times I've  been able to  get a few minutes sleep here  or there. The amenities provided are  pretty average when  compared to other  flights The leather  laptop bag was  quite nice though.  NO slippers, only  1 pair of  socks The restrooms  on the flight  are very small,  and don't provide  any in the way of toiletries  similar to other  airlines No free Wi-Fi in Business  which is not  available Another example  of BA's penny  drop in recent  years Regarding the  service and customer : Poor. Inattentive.  At meal times  There was offer  no water during  this flight. I had to go  to find an  attendant and ask.  There was also  no offer of  free snacks. Rude  wait times. My  partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant  was incredibly rude  the response. This  had us shocked. Different customers seem  to receive a  differing quality of  care A customer  like me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and  asked how they  felt whether they  wanted anything etc.  Both my partner and I were  never afforded the  right level of personal service. This is disappointing as  we paid the  full price for  the tickets so expect the same  quality of service.  The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while  our partner had chicken. Both were  slightly over cooked , the rice looked like porridge.  Both vegetables were  thin and flavourless.  The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much  better Summary: BA  have become the  home of long  queues The customer  service is way  above what I would expect for  another premium airline  offering a premium seat. You pay  that premium price  and a very  bad service. If  there are other  airlines available I  will choose them over BA these ."
1.0,"I travelled with  Swedish Airways from Sweden to Los  Angeles via London  in December 2022. When I arrived  in LAX one  all my bags were missing. There  was no information of the whereabouts  of my bag  so after searching  with someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag  was left behind. I gave her my details of  how I would  been staying and  they told me  if they would  contact me. After a few days  and still no contact I tried  to call British Airways customer service.  A woman at  the airport didn’t  have me a  flight reference number, so it was  really difficult to try and locate my bag, but  I finally found the reference number  on my bag  and said it would be delivered in a couple  more days. I told them that  i had switched hotels and gave  her the address for where I  was staying and  that was fine. But then a  couple of weeks went by and  the bag was  still nowhere to  have seen and  it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk  through the personnel there to try  to locate my  bags and they  said that it was delivered to  that first hotel  I stayed at,  even though I had given them  my updated address.  I asked them  what I should to since I  is flying home now. The guy  working the counter  told me that it wasn’t his  problem and that  I should figure  it out myself.  We questioned him  for his response  but he just  turned away. A  guy saw that and came up to me and  asked for his colleague and that they would send  someone to fetch my bag and  take it with  me my flight  was the next  flight I came  in and a  couple of days later I received my bag. I  filed a complaint  regarding claims on  the Airways website  where I had to buy clothes  and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have  my bag. In  response they said that they would  refund me for  my claims, it  was now April  or May) and I have still  NOT received the refund even after  several email conversations. I don’t know  anything to do  now about this situation since it  appears that no  one is willing to help me.  I am appalled  by how the  situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at British Airways and the  handling of customer ."
2.0,"Food was lousy. Who ever is planning the Asian Hindu Vegetarian meal  was clueless as to what this  dish includes. The snack was also lousy. It took us 2 hours  total to go from T5 to  gate and clear security check. The place was chaotic.  We get to our boarding gate , again a  long line with  20 minutes wait  on someone to check passport and boarding pass. Seats  for Premium economy  are ok, but when the passenger in front reclines,  it is very  little space for the window seat  passengers to cross ! Overall not  a good airline."
1.0,"But the worst ? The flight  to London to  Toronto got delayed  because we missed  the connecting flight  to Halifax. We were four including an infant and  a toddler aged 4 years, despite being delayed and missed the connecting  plane the ground staff were not at all helpful.  We waited for an hour to  ask them to  come to us and at 12 am they told  me they have not booked any  accommodation for us to stay that night and asked  us go search for a hotel  all your own,  so nice of  them British Airways. At least you guys should have  given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation. We will NOT to  travel on this  flight again."
1.0,Their ground staff  were not helpful. Felt like all they wanted to  accomplish was rush  us to check  bags and then  all passengers needed  assistance waiting in  a holding area  for a bus . Travelling with  a child with a disability was  a nightmare with  Qatar Airways. Logged a complaint and  it took almost  3 weeks to answer. Lost some of our luggage.  It was not  very good experience.
10.0,"Second time BA  premium Economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience. Despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in Hong Kong, this was a very pleasant flight. Seats are spacious and  comfortable in Premium Economy in this layout, attitude of  the cabin crew was excellent and food was good.  They communicate well and rebooked my connection during the  day which brought  peace of mind.  A very pleasant experience in BA Premium Economy after a major disappointment in Club World earlier this year."
2.0,"we changed our  flight from Brussels  and London Heathrow  to LAX on . We paid  extra to choose  these seats. Since  we cancelled they  never honored the  tickets that we bought, they seated us in totally  new seats. I  told the check  in employee, she  is very rude  she told us  that we have  not understand that  is a different . From London , LAX was worse, nobody in  this airport help . Employees from  London told us  that we have  no return next  day for our  flight we can  find a hotel  and go terminal  area and sleep . Finally one  employee help us  he gives a  money for hotel.  This was a  shame this airline.  They missed one  from work and  airline didn’t return  the money that  was paid for  our previous chosen  seats"
5.0,"It Copenhagen the  most chaotic ticket ing assignment in the history of airlines. Time on board never changed, no fixed counter at Airport. Abysmal  service that needs  urgent improvement here"
1.0,Worst experience of my life trying  to deal with the customer service for British Airways. So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who  was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to  only $50 on  the $600+ flight. Needless to say  that will go  to waste as I refuse to  deal with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized  company that couldn’t  properly address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to  giving me a band aid after slapping me in  the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was  helpful and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to  give you the runaround so heavily to the point  where exhaustion that you just give  it trying and  accept the loss.
3.0,"Due to code  violations with Cathay  Atlantic I was downgraded to BA on my return . I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I  booked and paid for an airline  providing great entertainment, food and service,  and I was forced to go hungry because they  literally had one  choice of meal  so it was  made To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny  comments and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a  burger or a  whole packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for  three hours you  spend the entertainment is compiled mainly  from B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could  access Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly,  the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to  injuries the earbuds  are the cheapest , lowest quality I have ever  experienced Since the last time I used this airline the crew are  extremely rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t  know is why it seems that  Qatar Airways look  for these characteristics  and desirable attributes for their crew. "
4.0,"Flight check in  very quick at  the First Wing  and quickly through security. The First  Class was quiet , a change  and a reasonably  good breakfast buffet . While BA  had brought back  the Highlife magazine  in the lounge,  It seems they used Covid to  buy all the  other magazines they  have to offer, as part of the endless BA  price cutting. The toilets in the  terminal were as disgusting as ever,  not cleaned frequently  on this visit and they are  about 20 years out of date  whereas public washrooms  at T5 are  newer and cleaner).  It was the  latest BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to  having no clue  who they were  seeing Endless announcements  to the gate about being a  late flight, requesting  people to check in bags, only  to get on  another flight that  was less than  fully full. Onboard , very good  service from Captain and the flight  to the gate  after 5 mins ! Breakfast had  no choices and  cost a fair . No hot  coffee or even  paper towels offered  at Club Europe  is more, another  sign of the  higher BA cost ? I wouldn't  argue but fares  were proportionately a  little higher now  then pre Covid. Cabin staff service  seemed perfunctory at  times not a  word of recognition  for BA Gold . Oneworld Emerald  is clear proof  not BA really  does care any  more Breakfast trays  appeared 45 mins into the flight,  and that was the  norm for staff , stay in  their front galley  throughout the rest  on the flight. Paid £4.99 for  4 hours wifi,  then dropped connection  for the next 40 mins. Sad  but note that  wifi service on Ryanair is more  than active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase  checks out nearly  instantly at Malaga,  which is standard  for BA business  grade baggage handling.  Why not waste  more money on  Club Europe, standards  just keep dropping. "
3.0,"We wouldn't recommend  British Airways at  present I tried  a call to customer service for  several times in  2 days and  nights and I  talked for more  than 30 minutes on the phone!  It ended hanging  up They are  exhausting themselves in  a high volume of calls. I  got an email an I am  now waiting for  2 weeks!   This is difficult  and navigate. It is not easy  either to have  the invoice of proof of receipt or look for  customer service. They  send you online but you don't  get a PDF file. So if  I need a  PDF of flight, you need to  have screenshots. And,  after the flight  was flown, you  had no access  in that booking  agent to reprint  that document or  how to create  that PDF. You  had to contact  through a customer  service which I  did it online, long waiting time,  but had to  take more than  a week to  receive it. Expensive and poor, almost  no customer service , difficult to use their website. An airline that  i wouldn't recommend.  This is such  sad shame that  by 2023 they  are still in  this position and  especially when they  have competitors around"
1.0,"Another horrible experience.  Just booked a ticket from Expedia  to a British  Virgin Operated flight  connecting Madrid to  Paris with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although  my Madrid to London flight was . On Jan 22nd, London was  freezing cold and  rainy The Iberian flight sat on  the tarmac for  several hours in  London because of the London weather.  On landing in  Terminal 3, I  had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The  BA was the  first flight to  London for the  holiday and it  had already taken off. The BA  bus was swamped  in people as  some people had  already spend the  evening due to the weather. The British Airways staff  explained that we  should go book  our hotel up to 200 pounds and we would  be reimbursed. I  am barely able  t find a  room and had  instead take an  airport cab. However when trying to  get the reimbursement,  someone said it  not their problem  and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they  would not reimburse  me to the  passengers When complaining  about BA, they said they only  booked the flight  for BA and  now they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely  horrible behavior by  this airline to not take any  credit for a  mistake that they 're using their  brand to sell  it to people  and don't want  to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me  just take the  cab back to  Terminal 3? Their people gave out  false information."
1.0,"United is the worst airline. Not one thing went  right I don’t understand how they have got it  so bad. Late take off, no gate when we arrived. Bags took over 40 minutes  to arrive. Horrendous"
2.0,"You will never fly British Airways again. To start,  our plane was over 2 hours late, with no weather and no  reason given. The boarding process was chaotic, both in the airport and onto the plane.  And more importantly, although we were in business class, it wasn’t really  economy class. There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that  another one sits . And those seats, like the rest, were extremely cramped and uncomfortable. I could not believe they called this business class."
1.0,Worst aircraft I have ever flown. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over &1000each we expected  so little space for the money my husbands knees  kept rubbing on seat in front which for a  10 hour+ flight is not acceptable.  the food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile. I would not entertain using BA again. Ground staff were great it’s the seating and food on offer  which lets the airline down. We  deserve so much more.
9.0,"I enjoyed my  arrival The boarding  was swift and service was very  friendly and professional.  Our food selection was good and  we enjoyed the  atmosphere The was  the one downside , when we  landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at  takeoff so in total from landing to getting the doors open it  took 30 minutes.  I believe the Heathrow T5 were having strike action  that week."
5.0,"Why do you make it so  bad After a so so lounge experience, the staff taking care of boarding treated us  with disdain bordering ! It can’t be training, who  could do that, it has to be no fear of anything happening. The “new” club  style suites are  one huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy. The crew were professional but I personally found the food menu rather odd. Essentially, there was one only main that I could handle and was then told they had ran out. I was a few rows in. "
1.0,"After several delays  with canceled flights, we finally made  it to Copenhagen  on American Airlines and British Airways flights. My luggage  is destroyed, wheels  fell off. I had to buy  another luggage in  and I made  a claim with  British Airways to reimburse me but  since I didn’t have the receipt  for my old luggage, they would  only cover 50%  of my new  luggage Advice, have  paid for your  old luggage prior  before flying so  you don’t get ripped off like  we did."
2.0,"And the worst  mistake of my  life After booking tickets together with my partner, we were then separated: ‘sorry, the flight  is full.’ The flight then took off 45 minutes late - no . The trolley service took over two hours and  passengers periodically skipped rows, and the response was flippant and rude: ‘whoops. Not sure how that happened. What do you want?’ Genuinely appalling from beginning to end.  might as well fly Easy Jet  and at least  not charge a  fee commensurate with  this poor quality of service, not like BA"
7.0,"I swore I 'd never fly BA again after  they messed me about so much  when trying to  go to Budapest. But the times for their flights  surprised me so  i decided to give them another . The flight left on time  for about), the  cabin was clean and the staff friendly. There was  also complimentary tea/coffee  or a breakfast  buffet to be  paid for economy. The flight was pleasant enough and I can't think of any negatives to write about. The flight and  accommodation was certainly head and shoulders above my trip  with easyjet."
4.0,"So many airlines  has gone downhill in recent years.  Costs have increased  while services have gone down. The  most disappointing thing  with BA is  the aspects that  we don’t need to get worse have. The check in staff at  Delta are downright  loud and abusive, shouting at passengers  off line here  & there and rolling their eyes  as passengers get  annoyed with the constant shouting and  British Airlines are  also competing globally more and more and this behaviour  was particularly noticeable  in Asia where  their service industry  are next level. I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this , many younger  employees are polite  or helpful. However there were a couple of older  employees that were  extremely rude and obnoxious.

Rude staff  onboard BA297 from LHR to ORD on April 05,  was ignored multiple times when simply  requesting a cup of water. When walked up to  me after a  number of attempts to request for water politely, the BA staff onboard yelled at my  husband and asked  her to be  brought back to seat. Horrible flight  by disappointing staff. Customer service is  terrible and online check-in never worked . BA never verified our COVID documents which were  sent in advance,  leaving me and my wife seated separately. I’ve lost respect for British Airways. Disgusted."
3.0,"I have flown  for BA for  20 years and there was a  point about 10 years ago when  things were getting better. Sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines.  During booking time, one is scammed an extortionate amount  to book a seat. At Heathrow  for check in the queues were unbelievably long and  lines at bag drop curt to  mention the least. The lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and BA has not invested  into them for  many years. On the flight the  food was okay, although portions are  still minimal. This was one of those days when the crew could  barely give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight. Next time they change CEO, can they  not do better than recruiting from  some second rate, budget Irish airline."
9.0,"Boarding at Mumbai  seemed chaotic and  poorly organised. Once  you board the  boarding announcements were  pretty relaxed and  delivered in typical  British style. The  flight was quite  nice It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding  and materials are  very good. I  was lucky that  the middle seat  is empty so  it didn’t suffer from the new  middle seat which  I think would have made it  that lot less  comfortable The IFE  were excellent, responsive  with good quality.  There is an  amazing selection of  music and movies and a good  variety of games.  Netflix is also  quite good not  bad Netflix quality  is still reasonable and I don’t  think £17.99 for  this flight is  bad value. You  would pay less  if you just  get short term  SMS messaging. Cabin crew were very  user Friendly and  Indian Catering was  excellent although on  a near 10hr  trip the small (but tasty) pastry  at the second  floor service wasn’t  good enough. Landing and processing at  departure was astonishingly  quick - it  seemed like it  is 3am, even  if it was . No queues  for waiting at  airports Even the  plane was super  fast at coming . Overall a  very solid experience  for economy. Significantly  cheaper than it used to be."
10.0,"London City Airport is a zoo,  not taking the  late departure on  board to LHR  was too bad.  Most passengers can  try the AA  Lounge Lounge, which  looks surprisingly good  but not too  crowded as it  seemed to cater  for BA's club  members only at  the time of  flight Lovely staff,  great food &  drink really pleasant. We flew an  old 787 with  the old style club seats. Seated  on the front  seat (just 3  seats of club)  with the window and adjecant aisle  which is really  nice if you  are with your  spouse Come to  thinking of it,  you will really  love this old  style -once cutting  out lay-out. There  are no better  way to fly  if you are  in couple. We  were in that  front row of  our front cabin  in both window  & aisle seat  and unobstructed access  to the aisle.  Sounds terrible you  had to pay for these seats,  because it obvioulsy  worked and we  are happy getting  these seats. Flying BA when the  weather is good  was amazing. Service  was impecable on  this flight. Just  a right mix  of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be  good as well,  food hardly touched ! I am  still sleeping in  those old club  type seats although bedding could be  better On time departure, smooth flight , early arrival  in Heathrow. We  went outside for  a smoke and  walked to the terminal through fast  security Security at LHR has always been terrible, but  BA security staff  are too busy  chatting among themselves  that all bags went through without  security checks. We  got a lovely  time at the  gate what a  great facility. The  VIP Lounge was  very busy and  this is just  a design disaster.  Only ever choose  this bizarre combination  for furniture: what  an mess! Food  we offer was  good and so  was the drinks.  My home stretch  in Amsterdam was  pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at  arrival door but  everyone recovered well and made everyone  very special with  their bar-cart service.  We love the  choice of drinks.  Bubble tea is  among the worst meal concepts in  The world and  I really don't  think BA stuck  by it through the years. No-one like the cucumber  or bread things,  oh hey... On  time landing in  Amsterdam but the  hour long taxi  and clumsy jet bridge connection ended  me with a 20 minute late  flight why is  it so hard  you connect a  jet in Amsterdam?  BA club in  Amsterdam is still  there I Love it!"
1.0,"Very poor service,  quite frustrating. Firstly my flight to LHR was cancelled on 16 Mar23, while I got a text message to inform me,  the information desk was unable to confirm if was  real or scam. Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass.  At the counter they informed me , the coach will be leaving  after 15mins for  my hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited  for over 45mins, there was no  one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions.  My transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the  airport When we got to the  dinner which is around 10:15pm the  counter informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of  the Motel than  a hotel. The room - was  smelled of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted  to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the  toilet came off in my hands,  i panicked and asked the reception  desk to change my room. After some discussion, they agreed to change it. I went to the alternate  room to my horror, it was occupied. I asked the staff to call a cab,  before I left. "
3.0,"Generally poor. Sent to gate on  arrival sat maybe 30 minutes, was  then announced as crew were not  happy with the  system there would  be a delay.  Absolute nonsense and there was a  misunderstanding on board of this statement. Watched the crew walk through to  the gate, my  understanding was they did not want to be there. Was given a miniscule amount of water, small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further  food service as  all processing machines were u/s. No  more updates or  announcements of crew for next two hours, then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water. When I said this should be complimentary, girl said  that was not her problem and  walked away."
1.0,"They changed our  assigned seats at  a last minute , charged us  and select new seats. Flight took off late, cabin  attendant served a tiny packet of pretzels. Arrived at Heathrow late, put  in a remote stand, loaded onto buses to terminal.  Called up at  airport security by  a clown of  a member of  TSA allowed 15 passengers at a time because of a trial. Queued at security for  20 minutes. "
1.0,Flew from London  Airport to Marrakech.  Staff changed our pre paid seats  in the last minute and even charged us to  use other seats. Boarding was chaos. Staff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the hold. I had one small bag however they never demanded other passengers with 2/3 bags and some with  checked luggage that was obviously too big. Flight was late taking off and the snack  was a miserable tiny packet of cheese pretzels. This airline is going downhill rapidly.
1.0,"I was meant to fly in January to Algeria. I paid over £300 for the ticket. Just a few days before I was meant to fly, my wife broke her foot. I had to then rebook  her in March and pay another £100. I called  British Airways 3 weeks before my flight in March . I told  them again that it had to me rebooked, as my wife was still not well. They told me that I don’t  have to pay anything to get it rebooked as I sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn’t well. However, they never sent me the ticket. They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to  spend either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. Or the second  offer they gave  you is to  get a refund of £80. (Tax only). I found it ridiculous that they told me  only pay a fraction of the money I previously paid. Each time I call them, they hang up on me; or  they continue telling me to pay £360. I made a complaint, and nothing happened."
1.0,"We have flown repeatedly with British  Columbia and the  One World alliance over the last few weeks. Every  plane was delayed.  Tonight we are back at the  gate in Miami  we have another  flight delay so  they will miss  our connecting flight. Finally, our luggage  arrived in Puerto  Rican with a  long delay and  we had to  make our round trip ... we haven't received any information about our  bag to this day, luckily we checked it ourselves  in the airport  and it was . The last  cancelled flight meant  the cabin crew  that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and  just can't do  it  Wir sind in den letzten Wochen immer hin mit Britisch Airways und dem One World Zusammenschluss geflogen. Jeder Flug  hat verspätet. Nun sitzen wir wieder  im Miami am  Airport und haben  aber wieder eine  der Verspätung sodass  in unseren Anschlussflug verpassen werden. Zuletzt  hat auch unser Gepäck mit 3 . Verspätung in Puerto Rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren Rundreise umplanen… wir haben bis  2020 noch keine  Chance über unser Gepäck erhalten, zum Glück haben wir selbst am Flughafen nachgesehen und es  war da… Beim  gut verpspäteten Flug meinte die Kabinen Crew dass auch  hier ihre Anschlussflüge verpassen und wir im selben Flugzeug  will und sie ben nichts machen. "
3.0,"I was horrified  by the extremely small seats and  extremely poor training that the crew  member receives. Not  ONE of them exuded any kind  of warmth or  had any desire  for make our  flight pleasant. The  chairs were so  tiny that regardless of the size  or your neighbors  we are forced  you touch each  seat constantly, if the seat in  front of you  is reclined you  have no choice  except to recline  you own, or  else you are  sitting in the head/ scalp of the person in  back of you.  It was revolting, they don't even  use napkins unless you ask with  your pre-meal drinks  at the secondary ! The last  time I flew BA it was a completely other  company and I was so sorry  to see how far the quality  control has slid.  That was really  very disappointing and  I regret that  I have already  had 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I 'll now have  and see if  they can change them. The pathetic 250 ml bottle of water, it's just a sip.  On the shorter  flight the seats  can even be  comfortable which was  a great pity  because the flight  got delayed by  about 3 hours  and we had  the wait on ."
2.0,"The worst cabin  layout ever: cramped , very low cost style and uncomfortable. Could suit for short flights but not for a 5 hours service. Catering is also a shame: 250ml of water  and a chocolate  bar for a  4 hours service.  May never fly BA again. "
8.0,"First time flying  on British Airways and first time  flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrow. I chose Premium Economy at a  reasonable price. I  am quite comfortable,  although the first  half of the flight from Mumbai  via Heathrow, the plane was a  little outdated and  I was only  one foot rest. The second leg, from Heathrow to  London the plane was brand new  - my premium  class seat had a pop up leg support which  was much more . Cabin service  seemed fine -  we appreciated that  people didn't come  in the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The  seats weren't that  good to be honest. After landing  on Heathrow, we had to wait  at the tarmac  around 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My  flight was less than an hour . The BA  team in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through  security quickly and I made it with time to  board for my next flight. When  I arrived in  Bahamas I found that my luggage  did make it  due to the  original connection time  from London. The BA baggage representative  in Nassau was  quite professional and took down my claim. My luggage  was on the  last BA flight , few days later, and British  Airways Nassau representative  handed it over  on a charter airline which shipped it to the  plane I was staying on. Very impressive and efficient!"
3.0,My latest affront. Stood in first  in line for an hour. Finally go up front  where the BA agent let 4 supposed VIPS with 12-14 large to-be-checked bags in front of all of us. Arrogant and  incompetent Add this  on a long  list of post-Covid disappointments. We are done with BA.
1.0,"had a flight  return flight between  Boston and Munich  on 3/11 to 3/17 in December.  The return flight was cancelled and  postponed from 3/17  till 3/12. British  Airlines only notified  BA of the  ticket change, but  never the second. Getting the flight  back took multiple  phone calls on  several occasions. Each  time needing to  call a helpful  message British Airway  representative told me , even though  BA cancelled my  flight they did  still have to  cancel the ticket.  I tried to  negotiate an $800  renewal fee. Through  my calling back, British Airways reinstated  a 3/17 flight  for 2/20 and  then again on . To make  certain it did  indeed get changed  again i checked  my status of  the ticket daily  between 3/12 to . It was  in those days.  By 3/16 when  it was time  to check-in for  another flight, it was gone. At  this airport the  staff at the  British Airways check-in  desk are not BA employees, so  no help resolve  this There are no BA representative  for the Munich . The confirmation  letter from British  Airways was of  zero value. I  was left stranded  at the airport."
1.0,"I tried to check in on line and was  informed that this  was not possible. I was given  a reason for this. I telephoned BA customer service and must have wasted nearly 2 hours being given wrong phone numbers  with incorrect information. Staff need customer training, better knowledge  of their product, and some manners. BA customer service was virtually non functional I will never fly with  them again."
1.0,"A catalogue of failures. We flew from Belfast to Heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours. We missed our onward Air Canada flight to  Edmonton as a  consequence On arriving in Calgary (after re-routing via Vancouver  which added over  3 hours to our journey) we met other passengers who had also missed the same Air Canada flight as their British Airways flight from Manchester had also been delayed by several hours. We are now on our way home only to find  the Heathrow to Belfast flight, which had already been cancelled and put back 2 hours,  was now delayed by another 2 hours. Avoid British Airways like the plague."
7.0,"The flight out  to Dubrovnik was  at the painful  time of 6:30  in the morning , from London , not an  ideal airport to  travel to at  this hour especially  if you have  to be at  an airport minimum  hour before to  be ready to  fly I understand  why the likes  as easyJet, Ryanair  and Wizzair fly  a very odd  schedule to utilise  these slots at  BA but it  was an odd  choice for BA  and most people  among us who  flew with them  trust them based  on quality not  on price alone.  BA LGW-DBV: Boarding  went fairly quick,  easy and efficient  as we took  out on time.  All announcements clear,  informative and inspired  – which is  what I appreciate  or expect of  BA pilots. Aircraft  was clean and  we had not  went through the  recent refurbishment program  and so had  taken advantage of  getting the 'Pinnacle'  seating in economy  cabin with more  comfortable and adjustable  leather headrests for  greater comfort. Complimentary . Mineral water  served as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary  choice of a  wet bar was  available and not  offered however. Cabin  occupants felt very  poor in both  design and behaviour  with messy ill-fitting  furniture and unclassy . Toilets clean , maintained, appreciate  the wipes being  freely available post-covid.  - DBV-LGW: For  whatever reason no  wifi or app  were available, despite  this Airport being  the very modern  facility with state  all the art , No queue  or manual check-in  process and ground  crew were very  customer friendly and  they Pro-actively offered  they take our  personal hand-luggage into  BA free of  charges but we  had to keep  it us as  they would have  a dash for  the home from  airport and trains  as the other  planes were being  taken already. We  do not understand  the delay to  our flight as  the inbound flight  on that day  actually took off  of time and  left on time.  As we travelled  to Dubrovnik out ta season, and  the airport was  full at that  time with all  flights being available , for this  aircraft taking off  this evening. All  the passengers in  our terminal at  this time including  ourselves were there  for take this  flight We boarded  full time and  then we all  waited at the  airport for 15  mins for no . It's truly  unbelievable how BA  chooses to take  it late when  all the services  in the airport  where operating and  not solely for  a purpose of  getting this flight  to take off.  As for this  flight were unpolished,  had unclear announcements  even during the  delay one couldn't  really remember where  was flying back ! No apology  or delay. Cabin <mask> a bit <mask> presented and <mask> more approachable. <mask> water given <mask> and the <mask> tiniest bag <mask> pretzels complimentary. <mask> for this <mask> were horrendous <mask> the new <mask> ones BA are installing from <mask> 14 onwards. <mask> seats have <mask> any padding, <mask> very hard <mask> also have <mask> headrests so <mask> hard to <mask> comfortable. We <mask> 55 minutes <mask> in Gatwick <mask> again no <mask> was given <mask> we were <mask> to catch <mask> last uncanceled <mask> home otherwise <mask> been stranded <mask> hours. We'd <mask> half an <mask> circling Gatwick <mask> we missed <mask> original landing <mask> Given 7 <mask> in the <mask> of the <mask> market thats <mask> they deserve <mask> we fly <mask> as we <mask> fly the <mask> carriers after <mask> many bad <mask> but it's <mask> no measure <mask> just the <mask> bad option. <mask> 1 point <mask> solely for <mask> something complimentary <mask>"
1.0,"If I could give a minus rating, I would.  Need to be LHR-AMS at 14.05 on 13th March.  Return to LHR  around 12.00, email to say flight . No one  able to help at LHR, said  to use the  apps Only halfway sensible option was from LCY-AMS at 17.05, so taxi ing there as trains from LHR not working (ok, not BA's fault). Get to LCY, showing as cancelled  in screen, so check the app and there it is. Rebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to  terminal to drop bag and was  told that I 'm only on  board for the flight, with no  indication of a  refund despite the app telling me  it was confirmed. The 18.35 to  Amsterdam was already overbooked so was  bumped onto the 19.30 flight to  Birmingham The 15.30  & 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happened. Eventually took off and the best  thing I can  tell is that  I landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive  at AMS, screen shows the 21.00  departure cancelled. Quickly  search app, and  here it was.  No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to  my 22.00 departure, so could have  been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed  off a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything  for a rebooked flight. Overall, dreadful.  Please just don't  try and hide  from apps and automated call centres. Avoid unless you have no other option, and even  better stop and consider if you  still need to go."
2.0,"Plane was over  1 hour late  and no problem  that can happen. But on arrival  to Heathrow, the  plane sits on  the runway for  45 minutes as  there was no  taxi stand to go to. Then once at the  runway we waited another 45 minutes  because there was  a bridge available  to enable us  to get off  the plane. Just  so inefficient."
2.0,"We were flying World Traveller Plus their Premium service. What it was not was Premium. We have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly Premium most times. BA's premium is the worst I have  come across. The flight from Heathrow to JFK was just ok, the flight back was  on a plane that should not be used. Old,  very uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had, one would not recline and one reclined without using  a button. BA needs to look at the Premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs. They have fallen far behind their competitors, they were once my preferred airline , now I try and avoid at all costs. I would rather pay more and fly with someone else."
1.0,This was literally one of the worst experiences. I haven’t been to an airport since. It began in Orlando flying back the flight plan  that went down and we were  stuck on the tarmac for 6 hours. Poor customer service and just ignored at times. Then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area  for our bags. Even though I booked through to Dublin. Another 4 hours I was told my bags were lost and  I continue to the desk to book a flight. Another hour later I was handed a card with a number and told to ring it. I was cut off three times and told I wouldn’t be able to get home that day despite several flights being available. Just booked my own flight and had lost my suit  of presents for Christmas and missed an engagement party.
1.0,"The usual shambolic unfolding that BA  have now unfortunately , come to  apologise for. We  have a long weekend flight booked to Munich that  was supposed to  start departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with  a newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original  9 February flight was cancelled. We  received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked  another day of  holiday off work  on this trip.  It ended up getting doing a  short trip to Paddington instead. On  my way back from the cancelled  flight both me  & my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of  any membership currently  out there), I  took us nearly 45 minutes to  talk to someone  that could help.  We believe BA outsource their call centres and so  we end up talking to people  who are following a script. The  truth is that  you might as  soon be speaking to an AI  rather than a human. We often received the response  akin to ‘computer  says no’. If  THIS is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what  the regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally  went to a  gentleman I had to wait 5  mins as his  machine booted up.  The BA then proceeded to auto-book  me onto a  replacement flight for  that next day but going to a different destination.  Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When  asking the robot at the BA call centre why  he booked us  into a replacement  ticket to a location 135km apart,  I couldn’t understand  my frustration.   Then someone was  trying to book us onto a flight the following  day at 17:00.  not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off , and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move  our booking, but at least we  were going to Munich and not  London - The  time of the  new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to  our check in . Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes . No email.  No text. No notification ever arrived  from BA to tell us that  our flight had  got cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have  possibly happened. The check in person said I should  get on the  phone to rebook. At this point, <mask> didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another <mask> in person <mask> an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook <mask> We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - <mask> Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. <mask> appears that <mask> now has access to a lounge and so <mask> really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than <mask> get free <mask> in the former. This was <mask> a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller <mask> to the <mask> of the <mask> The plane was a characteristically <mask> dumping ground <mask> they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and <mask> table down but they seemed to have cut <mask> on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. <mask> lost day of holiday and not an an <mask> of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from <mask> of the employees I interacted with."
2.0,"Found my case and took 6 weeks to locate  me and still  has not replied to me after 8 weeks. I had a business  holiday flight scheduled  to Dec 12 2022 … Manchester > Copenhagen -Bangkok , return flight  December 27 2022 . Bangkok >  London > Manchester.  Danish Airlines left  Copenhagen over an  hour late due  of the weather  affecting air traffic . When I  arrived in Copenhagen to get the  same flight for  London we were  10 minutes too  far and the  plane had gone  one of the  flight missed it).. SAS Airlines provided me with a  new itinerary the  same day being  - Copenhagen (SAS) > London (BA) > Dubai (Emirates) > Bangkok. I returned from Copenhagen  in London and  had collected my  gate pass at BA. We were  about 2 hours  after leaving London due the weather  when a passenger  was asked to leave the flight. I arrived in  Bangkok late and  were informed the  flight had gone.  They then informed  ME that I had to speak  to Thai Air  and get another  pass issued. I  wasted over an  hours phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the  call I then  checked with Thai  Air Dubai who informed me that  he did not have any alternative  flights and suggested  if I buy  a new ticket  to then claim the funds back . I paid £1279.43 for a Kuwait Airways flight  outside of Dubai  > Kuwaiti >  Thailand Whilst in Dubai I checked  out Kuwait Airlines regards my baggage  but they informed  us that it had not arrived  at London and  they would locate it and forward  me my Bangkok  ticket the following  week My baggage never arrived despite me completing lost baggage forms. I  went back home  late and was  informed by BA  and they have  received my bag  to London. "
1.0,"The incoming and  outgoing flight was  delayed because French  Road Traffic Controllers  are on strike , we were  flying over Germany,  apparently not BA's ! O arrival  our pilot announced we could not  proceed onto the  flight as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre ! It took  about 40 minutes  to find someone.  And when that  was done there  was a further  disruption as there  were no ground  crew to operate  the skybridge. All  because we were  stuck on the  runway for over  an hour within metres of our gate. Total disruption,  wasted time. Absolutely no excuse for this."
1.0,"Back in December  our family and  just as we  were getting onto  our plane were  told Even though  we had boarding  tickets and seats , and had  reservations 6 months  into advance we  was refused. It  turned out that  they had not  lived up to  expectations and they  only let all  other passengers on  their plane. So  the randomly (not)  many people were  tossed and turned . We were  refused as we  had no check  on luggage and  it was easier  to boot us  on despite them  only knowing my  details if I  booked connecting flights  to London etc.  I sought compensation  through BA (which  we was told  we could do)  and what an  administrative nightmare this process has been.  I wouldn't acknowledge  the complaint for  our family until  we had an  actual letter from  BA saying I  would act on  my behalf. Even  though I booked  or paid for  the tickets. So,  we uploaded the  claim letter no  more than 10 . Every time  they told me  had received it  and every time  I followed it , they told  that they hadn't.  It was no  easy way except  one post from  some to the  next to some ! Eventually, it  did go through  to them. I 've now chased  down the reimbursement  3 times. Each time they tell  me it has  already sent and  to be patient.  Again they tell  me that they  have to check  my account details.  Once again, I  send them the  account information that  we have done  so AND I  waited patiently for  the reimbursement. I  am convinced that  the business model  is for you  will get so frustrated you just  run away. Well,  I know what  I won't."
1.0,"As usual the flight is delayed  all week, it  is 3 hours  and I’m held  on a bus waiting to get taken to the  terminal I really  should explain how  deeply I detest  Thai Airways. If  there was a cheap budget airline  I could accept  this but it’s  outrageous prices for  the most unreliable  service"
8.0,"A short BA  air trip and  this is where  we excel. Clean aircraft, good crew, professional, on time (within LHR standards) and a good  quality product delivered. Pity the in flight food sales  was not a  bit more exciting and appealing as  more than a few asked about  their non existent  plane food options. But good overall.  The in self  service is great , once you  learn how to  use it with plenty assistance on hand for those who can’t."
1.0,"We are flying  Economy class for  part of our flight and then Premium economy for  our balance. In addition to the  extra tickets we  pay an additional  cost for our  seat Now BA is changing planes,  and arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas (my  wife & I)  where we were sitting together before and they want  to charge one  of us additional  just to be  sat next to  each other.   BA moved our  seats away from each other and we shouldn't have to pay for their change of  policy and their decision to not have us sitting together! We haven't even flown yet,  our airline is  crazy"
1.0," I am in Australia and on  Thursday night, went  in to book  the flight from  Melbourne to Malpensa , I did  however realise that  although I specifically  booked for flights  to Malpensa it  gave options to  different airports in Milan. When I  requested my itinerary by email, it  referred to another  airline in Milan.  The itinerary email did not provide  any means of contact for changes or advise me  on the 24 hour cooling off period. As it  was the weekend , I was unable to reach  their office until  Tuesday when they  advised me there  was no refund  ( than fees) as I had  missed the 24  hr cooling off period. Apparently as  the ticket was  booked in the UK, I needed  not contact them.  They have now cancelled the ticket . I will be going out  of my way in the future to avoid flying British Airways."
2.0,"At 7.54 am  on the day  I travel whilst  travelling to London , I received  an email advising  the flight had  be cancelled. I  was offered an  alternate flight with  United Airlines which  i had no  choice but to  take as I  must travel today.  He was flying  into LA to  visit a family member who is  end of life.  Then American Airlines  has downgrade my  flight from premium  flight to economy.  Called 3 times  to provide telephone , total useless,  no help, given  the wrong email  addresses for sending  false complains given  about me in  my email. I  had been a  Delta frequent flyer  4 decades and  have been a  loyal customer. I  would find I  was travelling 11  days in Economy  for even the  offer of a  refund let alone  any upgrade. This is completely unacceptable.  What has happened  to this company?  We have had  appalling treatment from  management"
10.0,"Would happily fly them again. I had a personal emergency and was  happy to reschedule my flights free of charge. Onboard  entertainment on LHR-IST  were no frills, but JFK-LHR was : good food,  tons of movies/cds on the IFE, open bar service the entire flight. Friendly flight attendants  were happy to provide an extra ."
4.0,"fly premium, only worth the extra  money for the  sake of extra . Penny pinching  - there’s no other benefit - one drink service , 10 hour , no fizz  left before take  - poor food,  it was badly . Food left  on tables 30  mins before landing with no tea and coffee offered.  Only small cups of water passed around but nothing  much about this.  These planes have  not decorated terribly  - feels like you’re in a  hotel waiting room.  None of any  excitement or joy.  Only fly if  your only option,  but fly premium , it’s not  very expensive -  certainly not worth much more than economy these days,  even if you’re in the middle 4."
1.0,"Unfortunately our morning flight was cancelled  and moved to  our afternoon flight, understanding sometimes these  things are unavoidable,  but it lost  us one day's  time in Cairo.  We were quite upset when we  stepped onto the  flight and were  moved into regular seats, on both  flights As my  husband had spasms,  I had to  place his legs  on my lap,  yet not once did ANY of  our attendants ask  if we were  ok as we were clearly struggling.  When the service  provided to us  for food, each  time we made , were told,  we were all  gone and we  needed to settle  for what they  have left. I  got the correct  airlines once home  and sent in  our complaints. They  replied with a  5 pound voucher  to our group."
8.0,"Though it was  one bit uncomfortable  sitting in an economy, the flight  crew made the  accommodations the best  she could.   What a nice  & professional crew.  Always attentive and  looked out for  their customers."
6.0,"Boarding was decently  comfortable The A380  flight has the  rather strange configuration  as Club World  where you neighbour is sitting in  the opposite position.  This A380 was  very full, rather  small amenity bag.  A welcome drink  is ok but  was rather long  waiting for the  waiter what is  available in the  bag The meal  is ok but  nothing great, aside  from Champagne no  red wines on  the flight. Service  was friendly but rather slow, no  free refills of  water offered. Acceptable  continental style breakfast.  Large narrow restrooms , any lotions  are similar. It  was an acceptable  breakfast nothing more.  On landing 50  minutes waiting for  seats labelled as  normal"
7.0,"Service on time and departure on time for a  trip to London Heathrow that is very ok, the  coach with rather  good seats. In business light meal  of Caesars salad, a mousse as sweet and choice  in drinks - nothing wrong for such a short  trip FA's were very friendly and  were on time."
1.0,The original flight was cancelled just over 2 weeks  from my actual  departure and although alternative flights were  offered British airways affected the trip I planned. It  feels like BA is doing a  service to passengers  other than being  allowed to deliver  good service.
1.0,Even just for a change. Poor ! British Airways  offers premium prices  for tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airline. Customer  service is impossible  to contact and  it seems BA  tries hard to  give any possible  customer communication address  where it's available.
4.0,"A competent check in staff, saw had a problem with my left  foot and insisted I could not take exit seat. Moved me to row 30 where  a middle seat  remained empty. On the other hand on board - huge line for toilets - 45 min into a 2.30 min flight a crew member realised one of  our toilets is closed - as  passengers had put their luggage there.  She announced that they could not serve hot drinks  for this flight and to bear  with them as service will be slow. On asking : ""They did not give us enough cups for hot drinks. And the card machine  is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip"". A bottle of water and a nutrigrain bar. "
5.0,"Flying in was so slow, no  baggage check in  and bag drop. Boarding was ok, flight totally full. Booked row 9 which was ok.  Limited space in  our bins. Seat and legroom ok.  Cabin crew ok, smiled, gave out the bottle of  water and pretzels. Flight itself was ok, landed 25 mins early and then waited 30 minutes for a stand and ground ! Bags came  through reasonably quickly. BA still seems  they believe it 's something special, a premium carrier. The reality is that it is not. The only reason we flew BA was we  were virtually free  money because both flights were cancelled last year. BA is our carrier  and last choice."
1.0,"My review relates  of the appalling experiences I had  with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was  booked to travel  to Madrid with British Airways and  on setting off , heard on  a radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and  found that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called  British Airways and have 26 minutes  on hold I  find myself speaking  to somebody in  their call centre in South Africa.  This person was hard to understand  due to a heavy accent and  apparently was incompetent and insisted that  the flight was  not cancelled. I made my way  to Heathrow and  amazingly enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had  the audacity to declare that the  aircraft was cancelled  but that “there  are no facilities  available at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me  while about 12  other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with  their telephone number  and told one  particular elderly gentleman : “go online  and rebook your  ticket I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA  employee to be  appalling I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again  given a long  line to a  service centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and  said that the flight was not cancelled and that  my airport “must be wrong”. He  again in a  sarcastic tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and  go to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter  team member rolled  his eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I  switched to BA  but this time I joined the  help line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man  in question booked  us onto the  last available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave  me a £30 voucher as a  form of compensation  and said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The  card proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature  area refused to accept it and although I was  told I could use it after  passing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal.  Apart than a  small bottle of  milk and a packet of pretzels nothing else was  provided This was a full flight  carrying so many people had been transferred from the <mask> flight. BA <mask> crew announced that any additional <mask> other than <mask> small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop."
8.0,"This was my first time flying with BA &  i was pleasantly surprised. Islamabad via  Dubai was very comfortable and the crew were great, friendly and helpful. The second flight , operated by Qatar Airways this was from Doha to Islamabad. My return journey was  another direct BA flight, 46kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights. Crew on this flight were really nice ! What let BA down was the food, it  really was not  much the IFE could do with  and more content but that's not really a huge issue."
1.0,"Hundreds of cancellations and delays and  no one apologized.  Went to London  was Feb 14th,  and our original  flight was cancelled,  and the rebooked  plane was cancelled , well, the third rebooked one  is supposed to departure at 12:50  and had several  delays until 2:24.  And we had  the wait 57  hours for our  flight to arrive."
9.0,"Jet 242 on the 6/2/23. Boarding  is delayed due to late arrival  from the incoming  aircraft Communication from  our ground staff was excellent and keep us informed.  The flight services were excellent, the  staff were friendly with excellent service! Overall, very happy with BA."
10.0,"Not only my first flight in  20 years, but  definitely my first  trip back to  England for 17 years. I flew  with PMI-LGW on  holiday and returned  on 29/01/2023. Both  Swiss Air and  Emirates offered very  good flight times  yet charged more than the flights  are worth for baggage. British Airways  were the most  economical and best value option available,  it offered ideal  flight times and  their €18 charge  per flight for  bags was very  low - Total  charge for both flights was €126  - Regular update  service via email,  free online seat  booking and check  bags Efficient staff  at the check  in desks at  BA and LGW ensured that long  delays were dealt  to as quickly as humanly possible.  Small aircraft, comfortable  comfortable seats with  good legroom (I'm  quite tall) Cabin crew were polite,  friendly and professional.  The flight food  / drinks were  excellent quality and reasonably priced, I  enjoyed the Meat ball and IPA  flights (€10 -/+ 15 on both ) I have flown 80+ times  over the last 50 years with  different airlines on  a propeller and  helicopter aircraft as well as one LGW-LHR helicopter transfer.  It was a  very different experience  but in the  UK we are now in the  hands of the  British airline' Nostalgia  with British Airways  was the best  airlines I've flown  with"
10.0,"my husband and  myself were flying  to Madrid on  Friday 3rd of  May for a  personal matter and  we had to be in Madrid  before 13:00 pm.  I had booked  the flight and  parking with BA . Unfortunately we  got a parking  I had never  had before, we got lost, and  after our 6:00  pm flight to  Barcelona I tried  to stay calm, cold head and  I went to  Qatar Airways to get help. The  first lady that  we spoke to  inquired if we 'd done the  reservation with BA  and we didn't  know that, she  showed us a number to call , told us , she couldn't do anything else,  so we had  not call that . We called  another number, which  started asking us  too call another  number, which  I did and  then the message was that opening  time were from  10 am till 4 pm, We  came back to  the lady and  asked that we  should wait until  10 am, but she told us that she could not do anything.  We did reach out to another  lady , a lovely young lady called Althea. She  came to look  into it, made  some calls, went  and check with  someone else to  the office, she  went to get  me to send  them a text message that I  wanted to call, and that got  through and the  other lovely lady  on the line,  changed our booking  would place us  for the following flight at 7.30 . They didn't  refund us for  that our car reservation and flight back were maintained  until we made it to Madrid.  For the support  from the lovely  lady her professionalism,  her care for  us we would  otherwise have make , She was so sweet, so caring, but at  that same time  so determined to  do she for  us went above  & beyond her  duty and her  professionalism"
10.0,Easy boarding process.  Very friendly crew.  Free drink and  a snack. All  In all a great experience. The  Crew are a  credit to BA.  Absolutely best crew in Europe.
2.0,"Outward journey BA245  London to Buenos Aires Club World  25 January 2023. Our experience was  poor from beginning  until end. Although we had reserved  for 11F and  when another passenger  already occupying 11F , crew made no attempt to  fix the problem.  Eventually I persuaded  the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat . We boarded  early but were  only offered drinks.  After I asked for a drink,  another crew member  said it was  very late and  vacated the seating . The same  crew member then began taking orders  at dinner but  would not write them all down , gave up  in a few  minutes for the  food briefing. She  asked us to  place our orders ! The hot  food smelled musty , felt old , ragged.   Most of the  staff wondered aloud  where my companion  or I were ?  My soup was cold, I was told  and was served  in flasks. Was that an explanation  not an excuse?  The coffee was  cold and tasted like instant granules.  my companion was  then served no  bread roll with  bread The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries'  however there was  a choice and my companion was  served a dried  fruit pastry, where  I would have  had a bread roll.  Although we had not  previously asked for or been offered  beverages other than those supplied at  the seat, small  containers of water  ran out. Return  journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller  Club 26 January  This was a  marked contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to  the professionalism throughout.  Such a poor  impression on Club World service that  the experience in  World Traveller Plus was so much  better and kinder. Weighed against the  expense of a flat bed, the  slight price difference  was not worth  waiting for the catalogue of errors  and inconveniences outlined  here"
4.0,"Check in agent  at LHR was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight . Seat was comfortable with good  elbow room. However, the food was poor - barely better than economy  and with a poor quality and  limited selection of  food In flight entertainment selections we’re  very limited. Far  different to what  they used to offer. Overall, this  premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money."
3.0,"So disappointing. I book BA so  I can fly during the day.  A return flight  for 6pm on  Friday was cancelled,  followed by a flight at 9pm.  We took off 1/2 hour late . I arrived at Gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections. I had to pay £70  on a taxi . Plus the seats are really  cramped I’m only  20 but my knees were hitting  a seat in  flight No more  flying for me.  BA are trading on their name  but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated. Ryanair has better aircraft  in take-off slots."
9.0,"Great service both  from the ground  and on board ; while their  business class product  may not be  leading edge, the service around the  ground experience was  certainly worth the  value of the  trip The Concorde  experience at Heathrow  was well managed  with a great  way to relax  in to the  airport Flight was  slightly delayed out  from Heathrow but  returned on schedule  for Johannesburg."
9.0,Welcome lounge at  Camden Town. On time departure. Drinks  excellent quality. Sound  good service. Breakfast reasonable. Arrival lounge  was good but  very cold.
9.0,"A really excellent journey. Lounge not overcrowded in late  and plenty of edible food. Easy . New Club World Suites great  service compared to when we last travelled in them  one year ago food and drink back to previous  with choice of individual wines rather  then bland blends,  each served individually with cut glass  of china. Beef cheek really tasty as was a  really good soup.  Breakfast excellent. Good  choice of movies.  Finally after a  poor night's sleep- fruits etc first, couldn't manage the  broken English which  were offered. Arrival  good time. What more could you want? Not quite up to Gulf  standards overall, but  it seems to  have eventually got  the business class back to standard"
2.0,"This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I  wanted to pamper  everyone so I  took business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I  should not mention  the chaos of  the gates several times, as these things may happen.  Also surprised me  were the lack of attention to passengers. The flight  got delayed by almost 3 hours.  Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea  how to get them, and we  got told that we only had  about 10 minutes to use them  as boarding had  already begun. Firstly,  we did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if  I got it,  you were not able to use  them When I finally got to  Newark airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross . Meantime, we  are told that  Due to problems, they did not load any food,  therefore the flight  would be without  the food on . The only food offered and given to everyone  on the plane was a small bag of nuts.  As a business class passenger, I  got offered drinks only. All in  total my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at  all It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive  price "
3.0,"It seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines. I cannot even  check in because  this requires the  transfer of documents  under Covid restrictions.  In the form  to start the  booking process is hopelessly broken. After  typing ""submit"" the  form just hangs . No error  code is given. I tried three different browsers on  three different devices. All have the same hang. Which  means you cannot  check in online  or can you  book a seat. I tried using  a chat bot,  and after 30 minutes of clicking ""try again"" I  felt I had  wasted enough time  with BA. "
2.0,"As a Spanish born individual living  within England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling  on the Customer Service team for  UK Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy,  and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two  separate booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this,  because I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even  though I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the  spot (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago)."
9.0,"Very rather empty  but quiet flight  to Tel Aviv,  a friendly cabin , and due  the the emptiness  in the flight , had an  empty row to myself which allowed  myself to work  efficiently and have  so much space  as required. Unfortunately  upon landing the  engines overheated and  I had to  stop for the  ground crew to  hose them down  this delayed us.  But an overall  good flight on  our part. This was the first  flight I have  taken this flight and it has  always taken off  at the correct  conditions"
9.0,Quick check in and staff member  was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to BA. Security at London  went fast. Galleries North was fine and showers were  free Organised flight . Plane was fine with good crew and new club world product.  The wife had a damaged storage  bin but otherwise  fine After take off there was a good drinks  & food service which was well run. Slept well  from time arrival. We both found the new seat  was harder to  sit in.
1.0,"Being a silver  customer and booking  a flight through  London to Dublin  I would have thought I could use the lounge even though BA  had Air Lingus for the flight. Travelled recently there with the same situation and was  taken in by  the kind Gentleman at the desk even though he  thought I had  to be Gold . He was really accommodating and it wasn’t a big deal. But the two ladies on the desk were like no.  No empathy there at all-saying the  black guy shouldn’t  have let me  know they will  get a word  with him ? Come on BA , booked the  ticket through you, and you made me fly with Air Lingus so  they should let  me use the lounge as a silver flier. "
3.0,"I find BA  extremely tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers. I have travelled using major  airline my whole life and although I know it sounds silly -  travelling on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or  food as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage. There  is no inflight  seating and the aircraft was very  noisy when I  asked why I had to pay  all my own  food and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and  both received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their  phones BA I now realise stands for Budget Airline.  They were great - what you  got for your  money not so ."
4.0,"Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets.  All seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours.  Very poor. Chicken cubes that reminded  one of dog  and mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese.  Children meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with  peppers and onions in it.   Again very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 , landing at  the remote stand , enduring a bus to the terminal and BA , my opinion, is terrible. This flight was so disappointing. Other than one great member of cabin crew, everything else was  just average."
5.0,"Another thing about British Airways A380 is the economy  section upstairs. Get  it if you can as it  takes you to  very small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very  wide the A380  looks tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that  shook uncontrollably and  started to react IFE. The food  was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry  roast 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes.  Good in taste  and quality. Mousse  cake was great ! Slight issue  in the snack ! Ordered a  vegetarian option which was marked as  a Regular meal arrived as well  as they were  not the same.  Asked a crew member to be told the difference  from the sticker on the box. Staff were ok.  Some decent but  still just ok.  Maybe BA just  feels a tad  slow these days.  Great to sit upstairs but that  was where the  service ended. Just  feels a bit dull and like  BA are just  the average airline.
"
1.0,"The staff are  terrible The plane was cold, we were shivering, they gave light blankets but they were  warm enough. Meals were basic. Entertainment was basic. Luggage is delayed, today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say ""call after 72 hours"". Tracking system is very vague, had to extract information from staff that they arrived to Vancouver  on Jan 2nd. I offered to collect baggage but very vague answer ""call the Airport"",  asked her for BA phone number at YVR but she said ""we don't have a phone number for you to call, call the main Airport"". Their policy states you can  lodge a claim only after 21 days."
1.0,"probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues:  Failure to purchase  tickets on international  (+ World) business class. This was  clearly made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an  estimated $600 on  the single leg  - for a family of four.  Despite the very  limited business class  seating layout on BA A380s, leaving  the seat selection  and change could  of been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even  newer aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg,  my boarding time for the A320  is over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of  management to speed  with the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding  area in satellite  sections of terminal  3 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers  the enter the roped off queue area before boarding  - have no idea why not) and so crowding  became extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken.  I was urged  twice (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload  my COVID documents""  even though, at  this end of  flight there are  no COVID documents required for travel.  When I filled in basic contact  details on the  site - and  would not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have  already verified"". I  then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com  site that one  was directed to after attempting to  reconnect to wifi  on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club  America at Heathrow  are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That  said the food  at the lounges  was of pretty good quality. The food quality in  these lounges at  home may be  the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food  / beverage service  is far below average for international  economy class. Terrible, one might say.  On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage  services and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at . Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight <mask> at the beginning of the flight. Meals were <mask> out haphazardly <mask> after take <mask> with the <mask> or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to <mask> class. There <mask> no coffee <mask> tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being <mask> disgusting. . There was no <mask> or bar <mask> in the <mask> areas - <mask> available to passengers during the <mask> - as <mask> standard on <mask> international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the <mask> attendants for <mask> I won't <mask> on the bizarre seating layout <mask> the A380, as others have rightly panned the <mask> and extremely poor design of <mask> seating. The seats are not <mask> 2"" long as stated on the BA website, <mask> I found <mask> seats too short for my <mask> 2"" height. The ""Priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the <mask> delivery."
2.0,"Definitely not recommended,  even for business class. The seats are ridiculous and small, the food is mediocre if that, and good  service with the  airlines even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight. The service however has been great. My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this  system but in this expensive business class, in order to move out  when you middle  trying to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. Your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times  over the last 4 months. Never again unless there is no other choice. By the way, the business class lounge south at Heathrow is a cattle pen."
8.0,"BA shuttle service  for the UK is still surprisingly a good product. When compared with  a long haul  this doesn’t always  make the best  of comments at times. It’s reasonable  service works well, fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk. I don’t  understand why they still offer a COVID style bottle of water and  juice when just  adding to a cup of tea  or snack would  be great add on for this ? Currently they have an on  board sky cafe but it’s too  expensive to work  or get connected in short trips."
6.0,"I must admit like many others  i tend to avoid BA long  trips where possible  thanks to the  generally poor reviews.  I had my  last ride on  my BA A380  this other day , it was  no exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really  nice but that’s about it. IFE  the work but  all that interesting anyway. I got  my map screenshot for a while.  There was poor  food but plenty  a nice white  beer and other  cold drinks made  it for it.  Flight crew pleasant but poor grooming  slowed them down.  Some skirts, some  dark suits, some  short sleeves some  jackets Some jackets  and waistcoat. Some  shoes on at  night and all  in all they  should have done  worse I think.  The delivery was  quite quick. Summing up well I  was still not coming back to  Australia not yet.  Maybe the old charm will return !"
4.0,"Where will BA  have their Business  Class cabin -  facing across on  a 777. It  was not so  many travelling facing  overhead as it  is but the  BA staff having  them pass food  parcels across the  queue of passengers  from business class ? As for having to pay  or reserve a  private seat -  an antiquated idea.  Business cabin staff  are fine, food  service check-in OK . Business lounge  not acceptable. The  loss of space  for the seating  and small screen  and disfunctional entertainment  is disappointing. Having  to step over  a reclining passengers  seats is not  good "
4.0,The £200 day  long flight for  free upgrade from economy to premium . At checkin  we could not  cancel my booking  so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the  phone you get  changed from the  person the checkin  desk sees? Took  about 5 minutes  to resolve. Seat  felt nice enough.  A pocket in ked a bit ! Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the  WAY back through  customs and there 's a bit  as a queue.  Security system is  ok but selection mediocre. Worst part  was the flight  being that at CPT so we were on a  long stand and  booked in. Through  passport control quickly but then it  is an absolute  nightmare to get our luggage which  on what would  ordinarily have been  perfectly reasonable flight.  That was worth  looking at £200  - £300 (its  very long flight)  and their offers  for £2000 or  better for premium  economy is comedy ? Score before the luggage fiasco  should have been  7 or 8  or 10. With the luggage fiasco I can't rate  it more than 4/10.
3.0,"BA website did not work (weirdly deleted my flight from ""upcoming flights"" on the day  of departure). Chaos at Cape Town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down. Chaos at the  gate / no queue management for premium passengers. Very  good new A350 with smart new  flight suite. Champagne warm (cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold, which is not true as Air France manage ). Disappointing meal, wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives.  Dinner ice cold and tasteless (why can't the champagne / white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese?). Good IFE system but mediocre film selection. Disappointing breakfast. Overall: 3 / 10. Flew Air France business the month before which was way better. So sad what's become of BA."
1.0,"Another terrible experience  on British Airways. After a short flight from London  Airport to Frankfurt,  they couldn't get my suitcase to me in time for my next  flight (on Cathay ), to Melbourne, despite a 3  hour gap between  the two flights.  Without me they  did arrange for the suitcase to  get transferred directly  to Melbourne -  instead it got  into Hong Kong  and left there. When they finally  got it down, they sent it  back to London. All happened over , so very  fast yet minimal communication from their . While the plane crew may be lovely, the service outside of  Melbourne has been  extremely short of  service and if given the option, I will avoid  flying with them  any future."
1.0,"London to Delhi  via London. We  had booked to  go from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd.  We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial  actions in the UK. I called to find out  if it may  disrupt our travel.  The representative kind of scared us  into being possibly stranded during our  journey and offered us a full  refund We called again to confirm  any other options but he did not offer any  alternative solutions. We  decided to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked  our tickets with another airline with double the cost  of our trip  was urgent (simultaneously).  He told us  they no longer can cancel our  ticket on the system but promised  that he will make it happen  if he told  that we would  receive a full refund. He processed  our cancellation. 5  minutes later he  informed us that  these tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel  the new tickets once he found  if they were  on another airline (we lost $1000  for cancelling the new tickets). Now,  our representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked  me why we were worrying about  an industrial action,  but that other “arrangements” will be  offered if there  is any issues  that was new  and never given to us before).  I kept our  Delta Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to  talk with the  airline and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We  only heard back from the manager. As we logged  on to check-in 15 hours before  take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did  not receive any  response from the airport nor the airline about this . We called BA again and  ask about rearrangements  to our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original  ticket was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since  that first flight  got cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated  with the overall experience and no  transparency nor accountability  that they wanted to charge us for any service  and changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while  the flights that  they could have booked were getting  checked out -  each customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we <mask> about. It <mask> been a frustrating experience - we lost time <mask> money and <mask> ruined our holidays completely. We <mask> demanded to speak to the <mask> who again did not want <mask> take any accountability for their <mask> and gave <mask> a small <mask> on the cancellation fee. In <mask> we were on the phone <mask> them for <mask> days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their <mask> policies towards their customers. We <mask> not feel taken care of <mask> all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without <mask> family and the missed the urgent reasons we <mask> travelling for. "
8.0,"Full A320 with  perfect pitch. Flight  is on time, with constant announcements from cockpit. Friendly  with free chips  and water. Quick  UPS delivery at  JFK"
3.0,"Another BA Shambles. Started off well with excellent check in at first  flight t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5.  Finally get on  only be told that none of the lights in first can be  seen at all, so the lights were on all . It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll  order the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy  on 1A got  on I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short  fries that were  like no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies.  Time out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October. As always , rest on your laurels and  treat your customers like idiots."
1.0,"BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19th. On the face of it, that was sensible  considering the weather in Iceland was appalling. However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which  stage I was  already struggling through  terrible driving conditions  and get to the airport. I got nowhere near before the conditions  were too bad. If they had  better advice they would have spared  myself the need to try and travel on roads that all ended  in closed. I am now booked onto the flight  to the 21st , downgraded for  these sins. Having  checked today, as  we type they  had not cancelled  my flight on  the 20th despite the road to  Iceland being closed! Do they not  do these things? Any help from  BA offered -  none really."
1.0,"BA cancelled my flight home, the last flight of the day into Heathrow, and tried to push me  on another flight to London City  2 hours later! My car was at Heathrow. I didn't want to try and cross  so late at  night on public transport with luggage,  seeing as there  are rail strikes  everywhere around that time. I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost  me for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all  worth it another  time on the Friday night so  I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund  for the €500 2 months on. It's such a  shame flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience. BA have cancelled or moved one leg of  every journey we've  had this year.  You are regrettably have to use  different airlines now  that have much  better reliability and customer service."
2.0,"Turned up 3.5 hours in advance,  Flight 5 at London Heathrow was  utter carnage, 100s of people trying to check in,  only 5 desks manned. Long queues at security due to only 4  gates open. People  started pushing, shouting,  the flight delayed  over 2 hours,  had to pilot  error due to  baggage all needing to be loaded.  No connecting flight in Doha, 12  hour wait til  last one. Received a voucher, approx £6 for the  full day. Arrived 1 day later,  my suitcase didn’t arrive with me.  Made a claim at the desk,  took 5 days  no update, no information, no offer  on compensation and no solution offer.  So now have a spoilt holiday,  many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don’t  understand if I  can be reimbursed. Beware with BA, expect low level or zero customer  service old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing. I will personally avoid BA in  future at all ."
2.0,"Boarding – at  landing at LGW they called Group  2 to board  ( were World  Tour Plus & Group 3), then  called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward. Why have  two boarding groups if you don’t  have them. Cabin  Service - Treated passengers as an  inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one  time a passenger  came coming out of the toilet  when a crew member approached and  another crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you  stepped aside to  push them past. Service – We were in the final row of  seats in WT+  which has a  minimum of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be  seen (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to  dinner there was only the vegetarian  option left of  our 3 menu  and Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ . There was a second hot meal served before  they landed. Again,  this same server got to us , and again  it was only  a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been  appropriate to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like  bacon in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the  butter Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a  little biscuit pack  of shortbread, pretty ! Drinks – They ran out of red wine  4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section.  I had to  walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet.  I flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months  ago in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised  – sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or  beer in BA),  drink options available  even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin  staff We will not be looking  into fly BA over Virgin in future."
5.0,"Delta baggage customer service was the  best I’ve ever experienced. I arrived  home in Phoenix on Sunday evening  without air tags  on my bags arrived on Monday, but it took  several more days before they were  finally delivered. I  learned that due  some delays caused  the freezing fog in London my luggage did not make it onto  the final flight.  We filled out the required form at the Phoenix airport and then  attempted to fill  them out online where I received  a message saying  that the bags  has already been reported missing and  could enter the  track code that  have been sent  by me via email, but no  response was received.  I made phone  contact daily and was told a  letter was sent and I should  call back within 24 hours. Finally the email with  my tracking number was received on Tuesday night. I went online with the tracking number on Wednesday and  they requested that  me provide the  same information that  we had given them on the  counter at the airport. My luggage was finally delivered on Thursday afternoon.  🙂"
6.0,"British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The  catering staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was  very busy, but the food was very good. There  is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful  thanks to the lack of any queue management system and the majority  were passengers congregating around the gate.  Despite BA using  the group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight  menu was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done  better with champagne  bars and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food  spread for the length of flight. The food was  quite good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have  always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat  was a standard  A seat, with a table in  the middle seat  in Club Europe,  a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The  interior was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues.  The A321 featured  software which contains a very good landing page with  landing information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or  text also. Overall, the airline is  not a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their  flight staff. The cabin manager was very good, but  several other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in  Economy class. She  was touching her face, not making  eye contact with passengers, and seemed  angry and like she did not want to be there."
1.0,"Stupidly tried BA  and after a five year gap  I paid over  money for my wife and I  could go to  Australia because I thought the new Business Class layout  might rival Virgin  Atlantic on the route. About six months ago BA  said they were switching planes to the old antique  Economy layout but  that was too late to reorganise  our holiday logistics. Sure enough we  made the most  incredibly uncomfortable flights with no room (eight seats across), worn out fittings, inedible food and surly FAs."
8.0,Seat horribly narrow;  seated on a  chair Thankfully the  cabin was only  one quarter full  and was able  too stretch out.  Food and beverage  service was good ; it was  like having a  full beer not  a cup of  water that overflows!  The crew very  kindly Booked as  their BA ticket  and included travel on Qatar Airways  and well.
3.0,"London to London  delays by 1  hour My wife  and I now  know that a  particular flight will  be late and  we Very rarely  in time. As  much as you  know this, you won’t be disappointed  planning ahead. There’s a high risk  for delays. If you are connecting  on another airline with OneWorld it’s  more risky."
6.0,"When I tried to check in online, I was offered an upgrade to premium economy  for just under £300. I decided  not take it, but then the website wouldn't allow  me to choose seats or to  log in. I  emailed BA and was happy that  a call was  picked up quickly, but I was  still told that  because I had changed my booking,  and had to check in at  the airport. So we turned up  three hours before the flight, only  then be told  that our two adjacent aisle seats  in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row  and four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix  and suggested we  use the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed  and when we did reach the front of the  line we were told to try  delaying the boarding . At the gate, we finally  got to get  our aisle seat  by one window, not sitting together.  Despite going through  on the flight  felt surprisingly good,  and decent food , very good ! We flew back economy, which  wasn too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not  had been better.  Having obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades,  as everything else was good."
3.0,"I flew from  London to LHR.  Excellent service, attentive  staff first drink , then meal  choice (choice of three meals), later , drink service. In reality - excellent flight. Couple  more days later I flew back from LHR to  Dubai Boarding at  airport T5 was a total chaos.  The service cannot really be called . No curtain , business and  business class (which later caused people  still passing to  walk to the toilet). Meal service could not get  more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly  5 mins to serve. Constantly interrupted  with people passing  into the toilets  at this time , I don´t know if there was any meal choice as no  one bothers talking  with you. I  was served that  afternoon tea  consisting of three  small bites and  a drink. Why  should we bother serving you also  a scone. Hardly after 5 mins  waiting to be taken away -  when I asked  for my scone  - came as  a surprise I  am not served  any (no co-ordination  by the crew).   Crew busy chatting at the  table In reality - the service  could not get  any worse. One  just must ask  why do you  need the premium  service for? "
4.0,"Think again especially  for business. The  plane is ancient,  but world lounges , a catastrophe  for Heathrow. Business  class seat is  next to economy and electronics are  very poor onboard. "
3.0,"During both the  first and return , we were  not offered a  complimentary meal. We received a tiny  bag of chips  & a very small bottle of  Sprite What outraged us the most  is that during the return flight we couldn't even order any food / drink because  their card reader didn't function. The  first and last time we'll fly with BA."
1.0," I was flying to Warsaw for  another day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami  the next day.  However my flight was delayed in Denver by 3  hours As such  i knew I 'd miss my  meet in Warsaw.  My Denver to Heathrow flight was  horrible The plane  is dirty, I  flew in economy, I usually fly  economy or Premium  Economy but on  that flight there  was no availability.  The plane was only about 2/3  empty and the  bathroom was not . My food  were inedible and the seats very  dirty although the  window seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it  became a complete  chaos Passengers everywhere  trying to rebook missed connections. Not  only my flight  but multiple other  people had missed  flights After waiting in line for  another hour I was finally rebooked  onto another BA  flight to Warsaw.  The plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have . Packed in  with sardines. My bag never showed up so i  had to cancel my meeting and  now have no  plans to fly  back to Miami.  Boeing has shown no desire to  help other than  just give me  more answers and  say hopefully my  bags will show  back in Miami at some point  that I can retrieve it from  there I mean  My bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it  into Warsaw yet BA in unwilling  the do anything  but expedite getting  the bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami  that next day. "
9.0,"Booked a BA  holiday to Marrakech, after posting a negative review regarding  the double tier points credit, I can now confirm that the points  has been credited.  It took a while but BA did eventually make  up on their promise, thank you. Based on things now being resolved  I have travelled  with BA since and I am  set to travel  to South Africa in First class on 2nd January, looking forward to the new BA Concorde lounge. Keep  that up BA,  it is indeed a 2way street."
2.0,"Absolutely sub-par service.  - No online  meal selection. Staff  damn much dropped  off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger  demanded it changed. Last meal was  added to the last 40 minutes  before flight. Plates were literally grabbed  and I had  a hand over  my unfinished plate that the staff  had dropped on me. No apology. No offer of  a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece  of paper to clean my jacket. None of the  others were told  they straighten up  the seats before ? Because the  tray before me was so tilted, I could barely  see the plate on the tray  with things slipping ! Staff walked  over with some  tea and biscuits.  Staff got exhausted  right before she got to me. She just looked  to me and  turned away. Nothing  else was offered."
7.0,"I virtually gave up on British Airways about three years ago, writing  up my Avios and opting for other airlines. But my return flights  through Heathrow to Lisbon this week  was very good.  My aircraft were  very much full,  but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good. A particular  nod to a  gate attendant called Jo, but all  flight teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive.  Still going to  need to start spending those Avios."
7.0,"I was pleasantly  impressed that the airline could maintain  its steady schedule , little delay  considering the time  during the year  and the weather. The flight from  Glasgow was my  return flight to Scotland, but I originally booked to  travel to and  fro Toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and I rebooked for  another cheaper flight. The inflight service  seemed pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and  blanket As well  as walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small  donation prior to the leading meal service. While the food was typical air plane food. I thoroughly enjoyed  the flight and  had no issues at all with  future flights."
1.0,"British Airways is  terrible their website  really atrocious, and  they wouldn't let  us check-in until  6 hours before  our flight. I have been trying  almost 6 hours  either check in  through their website, and/or find a real person to  speak with. Customer  Service had such  a thick accent  they didn't think  they were speaking . "
4.0,Flew from Amman to London on Nov. 14 2022. Not sure what type of aircraft it was. My Ticket was economy plus. The flight  took 5h35m. We received exactly 250ml  of water and  only 10 potato ! The seats did not recline  and there was no entertainment system. Any other food  or drink had to be purchased.  So we couldn't even get a  free cup of coffee or teas. It is the  second time I have flown with  Delta recently and  very unhappy each time but did  NOT write a review. Will honestly  only fly them again if I  could help it.
1.0,"This is the worst experience I 've ever had  with any airline.  I flew with British Airline on  June 21st 2022. I had one  checked bag that was lost at  LA Airport. I am aware that  during that time there was a  serious error with the baggage belt and many travelers  were affected. I filed a report  for my missing  luggage on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that  happened on August  30 I waited  around for three weeks (which is  the time frame to either find the bag or  be eligible for  any compensation). When  I did not receive any update  about my lost  baggage I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a  reply from the  customer relation with  no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried  to update the  situation but still no response until  finally I contacted  their baggage team  and they were not helpful and did not ease  my prolonged waiting.  I only way to contact customer  support is via  this website and they're not even  talking back to me. Every time  i talk to  the customer service  person they tell me to wait  for more. I  had been waiting  for almost three  months now and my issue is  NOT resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA."
2.0,"Flight LHR T5  - CPT November 2022:  BA  plane and website  were working properly - would not  scan my ticket. LHR T5 smooth  & calm. Checking  was quick. -  My boarding card  did not scan  by security, they  gave me one  and someone else  in a different .  Ran  off to checkin , get correct ! Bags also  checked incorrectly and  completely disappeared.   Finally ran off to find my  bag in the depths of T5 , retag them (amazingly they did show up in  Old Town).   My only main lounge was open not B and  B pier lounges.  Turns out this  was false information  that B Pier  only was open.  - I was  shown main lounge  I was overcrowded  / worn out.  Ran late to  boarding gate (train not working). There 's a Biz et lane (quick)  and then a  long queue to get on the plane as they only had one , not two. Seat comfy and  seat clean but  the sinks were  covered up as the waste was  not working. I was offered hand  towels instead but  this is disgusting (imagine going to  the bathroom and not being able  t wash your  hands as there 's no sink). Unbelievable that BA  has planes in  bad condition. Food  & Wine served way too late (choice of wine , cold food,  or eat food , and matching  to come a  couple of an  hr later). Overall , 2/10. Flew  from France (Fortalaza , CDG to  Spain two weeks ) which was way better. How  embarrassing for BA."
1.0,"Worst experience ever. Outbound flight was  cancelled and I was not notified. I was rebooked  for a very uncomfortable trip. Inbound  flight delayed 1 hour, also not  recommended On top  if it, they boarded my hand luggage, which was  my only bag I had. Extra wait in Milan then. Food is  disgusting"
5.0,"Trade in was a shambles at  with just 3  gates open for  a very full . The bag drop queue was  much longer than the regular check-in queue! Boarding was done by zones  agent that was  sorted out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not  so engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The  plane was cramped  and the seats in economy were  and I was  seated in an  economy seat (row  2 where there is an entertainment  screen taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and  no IFE screens. The meal was  fine and there was no bar service before the  boarding this time. On lading, we were served a  cheese sandwich which  was oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it  was not pleasant to handle but  still very good! The plane landed  on a remote stand which meant that we had  a be bussed  onto T5 and since it was raining, it was  quite a nice . Overall, I  see this just as a mediocre journey."
1.0,Beyond disgusted with  the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me  after 5 weeks of emails and  letters to BA. Two pieces reported 29th September. BA responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. All  coming from an  airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world. Disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.
1.0,"On July 19th 2022 I had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that BA had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to Italy and we've lost  3 days and  had additional expenses in retrieving them,  expenses which I had provided all copy of receipts for. I requested for my expenses to be reimbursed,  BA agreed, I sent all requested information and was told in 2  weeks I will be receiving it. It's 4 months later and British  Airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow-ups on  the matter."
1.0,"I booked the flight on Oct 8, but have  them cancel the  trip on the  next day after  so that I  cannot get my entry visa in  order for the flight. And I  then receive a  confirmation email says my flight was  cancelled But in the cancellation email, the booking reference  line is a  different one. So  BA requested cancellation, but BA canceled another person's flight and sent the  email to my email? I assumed that my flight  is canceled, but  for more than  3 weeks, I still have not  received any refund,  then I reached out, and it  turned out my flight is still on?! And it  is getting even  more ridiculous when  people try to  call out to BA. I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and  emails but none was able to  confirm what actually  happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. Based on my  experience no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put in. Given all I  just experienced, I  put zero faith  in British Airways."
6.0,"London to Gibraltar on 25th October 2022. I booked  the flight several  months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by  my experience.   Airlines attempt to  nickel and dime the customers with  low seat selection prices. Offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast , one gains  an impression of where BA aim  will be positioned , of late.  This A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. The staff disappeared for most of the flight. The flight was punctual but I felt cheated , under whelmed  by the experience.  BA"
1.0,I’ve generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with  them if they fly the route I’m after but  my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. We should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally  landed 4.5 hours  is not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr  long flight. Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the  breakfast and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get  out because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away  quickly enough. That  night then basically  to last you  see of them until they came around an hour or so before . I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect  good service. They were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board. We’re still waiting for you to  pay our compensation  that has been  given to us by the official ombudsman in July  following the cancellation of our flight to Miami in  June This was  cancelled at 3am  for the 2:30 pm flight !
9.0,"A great flight. The suites on  the aircraft really provide maximum comfort.  Qatar has returned to full service so meals were  full menus and hot towels provided…etc . was quite  pleasant with choices provided for both meals. Service was  great I prefer  the have the  same person serving  me rather than a hodge pudge  so that’s my preference. Entertainment was  great as was ! No real  seats except a  large one. The  dining table seemed  inches from me , eating in  its closest position.  This actually felt  like I was  flying a true business class, not by Qatar’s standards,  but that’s another ."
9.0,"I am happy  to say that this flight was quite good. Except  for the second rate Euro business seating, everything was  pretty well done.  The friendly, informative  airline crew served  me good hot breakfast while being very communicative to  those nervous about  the transit. Well ... Unfortunately, a bus gate was  unavailable upon arrival."
3.0,"Just a few  years ago flying  with BA was enjoyable, but times  has changed. These  days about five  days on board  the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal  5 experience still  feels classy, and  in the way  out it felt  well staffed and . On board  but it’s just  not an experience  to be endured.  This mean decision  of split seats ; nicer for  a first half  on the plane,  then nastier for  the rest underlines : There is  limited entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases  get brought to the seat after  boarding from an app. There is  little attempt to  order fresh or  frozen food on  a day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to  ask for, when trapped on board  for five hours? You get a  really tiny bottle  of water and  a small cereal . On the  return flight the  crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully  dropped a bag  under a toilet door down the  hall in case  passengers wanted to  make their way  down and clear  that up themselves.  Seat buttons have been deleted on  all seats and  even seat pitch  is squeezed. On  my return flight,  through one reason  or another due  the BA’s delays  on the previous  day we were  just under two hours late getting off the plane , in the  evening and some  people couldn’t travel  after all because  they were not enough crew. The  flight crew were  all distinctly more  experienced on this ... Altogether, I  can say good things if there  are any -  although it’s hard  to think of anything I could  blame BA for; and that is  a pity, because  I used to  have a professional  company to deal  in and a  company worth looking forward to when  on European journeys."
9.0,"A very positive experience with BA. Seats were new  but club seats , very comfortable for sleep. Food was fine but not outstanding. Wi-Fi  great and video screen large and  comfortable Baggage came out very quickly at Heathrow, had the same experience on the return flight to Atlanta. All in all, would fly BA again, but would probably want to make sure it is new seats."
2.0,"Baby across the  aisle cried nonstop  while crew yakked  from the galley , on this  particular flight there  was no possibility for any sleep , even rest.  Warning to a  family member that  my colleagues were  complaining loudly made no difference at  all My second meal was something inedible, no way  to get a  fresh bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment  with dried something.  Food took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had  no priority for  First or even First passengers; we were all kept  seated after many  food bags had  already delivered. A380  was a great aircraft but the  best seating is  in the very tired old yin/yang  style with some  passengers stuck in the middle of  our seats (probably  not what anyone  was expecting in business class these days)"
8.0,"Evening flight from  Dubai to IAD  was an A380. Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work  well and staff have to be . Boarding was very poorly managed.  Our ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a  long flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small  so there was  ample seating for  such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50  mins late but the pilot kept  us informed on  the issue. Once  on service started  quite quickly and  their cabin crew were very pleasant  but helpful. They  do their job  done professionally and  efficiently They answered  all call bells promptly and nothing was too much . They started  it with a  coffee service and  very generous with  it and then  added the meal service and the  service was very  nice The IFE  is old and clunky but had sufficient movies and  TV programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. The seat  felt comfortable but legroom was tight.  All in, it was an uneventful journey and I 'd give it  the thumbs up but ground services  needed attention."
1.0,"We boarded our  plane at Edinburgh  from London for  our connecting flight to San Francisco , 4th October,  We were a  group of Americas heading back to  America from Scotland because of the  World Golf at  Fort Andrews. The  attendant at the  airport was rude,  and was actually  trying to be  yelling at the  airport Shouting, snapping  at people and  generally had a  really horrible way  about her. On  the flight from  Glasgow to San  Diego prior to the 24 hour  check in, I  paid £150+ to reserve two seats  for our once  upon a life  away holiday to ! Once we  boarded it was  discovered that the  seat I was sitting in was  broke The recliner  seat was not  adjustable and had  been pushed into  a frame of  an arm rest. I asked the  cabin attendant at  the time of there was anything  that could be  doing but not  once was she  incredibly rude, but  completely uninterested in  the fact that  I was going  and have to  wait for 11  hrs on a flight with a  chair that wouldn't recline. I eventually  called the flight  crew state that  he would report  the fault, only  to find out  that multiple other  chairs on the economy seating area  were also broken.  Communication with British  airline staff has  become absolutely horrendous.  Shortly after getting  off the flight,  I decided to  make a complaint to British Airways.  Bear in mind , I had  paid £150+ for the privilege of  having a seat. I asked for  the refund for  the cost of  a booking of  a seat prior to the 24  hours check in,  just to be  advised no, they  only do refunds.  Having paid for  a product that  had broken, met  absolutely nothing but  rude staff, and  yet are telling me they can't  cover the cost of booking the  next 4 emails  with the customer  support and they  were still refusing,  they are also  refusing to tell  me whether or not that the  issue was reported  on to me , in that  case All they 've now offered  me is a  free BA voucher,  that I declined  on the basis  that if they  replaced my seats  ( example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in)  and a £50  refund would be  acceptable but not  because I have  made my own  right to select  a seat that  was broken. After  reading my experiences  of BA, I  will not be  using them again.  Stop rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose  other carrier in  any future, im  so ashamed that BA treats people the way they  have when they  have a national  airline for Great ness"
3.0,"Upon entering the  airport it was  extremely rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with  their luggage and  finding their seats  the heating was  such that I  was suffocating. I  did faint due  to that heat,  luckily the cabin  attendants were very  helpful so all  the thanks to  those who helped  me at that  point Other then  later when I  called cabin crew  I ask for  hot water they took half an  minute to response.  :)"
7.0,"Overall I prefer the Boeing 777 over the A380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. Check-in was  very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at Heathrow. T5 is  a whole other story. Once through security its up  the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then  down an escalator  and finally down the jet bridge  into the plane. I have been  into and out of Heathrow many times but never  on T5 before. Anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks  / meal service  was fine. It was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all  moving around most of the flight. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so  it occupied my time with several  shows Nice landing  at LAX. All in all BA was just fine."
8.0,"Flew back to  BA from Miami  in new Club  Class Suite -  another huge improvement  from the elderly  Yin and Yang style Club World.  Pretty easy. Took  2 1/2 hour  trip due to delayed incoming aircraft  but made up  the time on  the back and  landed on time.  Nice comfortable suite  and plenty of  room for bits  & pieces. Bedding  a large pillow  for Attentive FA's , especially Anna  - addressed me  by name). However, let down by  above average catering  - very good  short rib beef  but underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once , a very poor choice of  seat on the IFE which let  out the excellent  new touch screen. Refused to pay BA's extortionate pre-pay , book your  flight fees, and  we got 2  tickets together. C'mon  guys - do  I not pay  enough already to  use Club Class . I can  recommend BA's new  Master Class and  hopefully will travel this way - if we can  manage it - in future."
9.0,I flew with  my baggage but  arrival at Dubai  very quick. Entered  airport which was  wee bit small  but good and  the offerings sound.  Ran on A380  arrived on time. Few technical issues  on IFE which  might have been  more irritating had  I been a  longer flight. Decent  meal and slept  in Arrivals lounge . Would recommend.
1.0,"London to Cairo. First, on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water. Even Southwest is more generous. When unable to connect my phone to order food, I hit  the FA call button with no  luck for more than an hour. When the FA came to collect  food I had to show him the call light and he gruffly  told me what was the matter. He used his  phone to place the order."
10.0,"My review is  mainly about Maddie, crew member who  took care of . She was  very warm, friendly and nothing was  in much trouble. Smiling from start  till finish. She  should be the  brand ambassador for ."
3.0,"Three hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft, no inflight entertainment. In economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water  and packet of  biscuits and a  small selection of food items for purchase."
6.0,"I Had an  easy transfer at  JFK from American  airport to British  Airways heading to  London First ride  on an A380  leaves me with  no feeling that  no plane type  should ever be  my first choice.  While seated upstairs  and the cabin  it seemed very  spacious but the  aisle and rows  felt very cramped.  While the passenger 's front reclined  and back of  that seat was  just inches from  the face and  I had a  pretty difficult time  getting to view  a seat back  on screen. The  plane itself wasn't  too bad but  you felt squished  / locked in.  As a plus  side having a  back seat gave  you this nice  seating area by  your side. Ground  attendants were pleasant  the cabin crew  were really nice.  Lots of beverages  provided and multiple  coffee runs were  available during the  flight Dinner was  good as was  the morning pre-landing , The entertainment  center was very  nice and had  some pretty good  variety of movies,  dance music and . All in , it was  a OK experience  and did get  it to London  within time and  my baggage arrived , but I'm  still sold on  the A380. T5  and LHR is  another story that  would be in  a different review.  what a mess  the place is."
7.0,Getting in at  is straightforward. There is a small  first class lounge at Jersey with  a drinks range  but some limited . Flight boarded  good time but  take off was  delayed due to  limited visibility at LHR. Captain kept us well informed and we eventually  set off 50 mins behind schedule  with a 20  mins late arrival at Heathrow. Good service from the  cabin crew and  a bacon roll  and coffee served.  Amazing that the wait for cases at Heathrow T5 was as long  as the flight!
8.0,Getting in at  the T5 was  quite quick and  easy for security . We used  The South Lounge  that was supposed  the be the  lounge at the  back but was very busy and  took for our  party of 3 to get seated together. Flight boarded  in time. Whilst  this is only a short flight  (~ mins) the  hospitality of the  ground crew was outstanding. Glass of  a Coronation Chicken  Soup and a  drink all served  as a smile  and a little . In spite  of some of  the issues with  security their cabin  meals are usually  excellent and this  is no exception.  Flight landed on  board and bags  were quite promptly.
3.0,"The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as  good has the  United Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this  excitement was about. This was my first time flying  into Business Class, and though I  felt well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is  not a normal economy seat, with the middle seat  taken off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight.  The service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2  meals ran out,  so the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my  American Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff  did their best, but since there  are 32 business  Class passengers on a single aisle , with a small galley, there was so much they could do.  Also the 32  seats shared one single WC, meaning  very long line for the bath , something I  have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR,  BA did not get a contact gate, but the  problem was that there was no  taxi either, and the crew announced , they had no idea when  a bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on  the airport than  their airline, but since BA is the main operator  at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation."
9.0,"Today is my  third time flying  the new Club , which, in  MY opinion, is  pretty good. Flight  from the US, including mine, departed  the concourse C  of Terminal 5  but did not  have many shopping  nor dining options.  Unfortunately it was  crowded so finding seating was quite  easy The highlight  is the Club  Bar which is  spacious and provides  not great deal  in privacy. Meal service was slow,  and everything was  not on one  and all at . I think  now is the  stage for them  and begin to  go back to pre-pandemic standard. At  times the food tasted good, which  is not something  I previously experienced  with BA flights,  even in First Class"
1.0,"My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less  then 12h notice - without being given any alternative  options or rebook ed upon alternative flight. Upon calling  Customer service, customer  services who said  they can only  send me a  seat 2 days later. They did  NOT work with  that as I  missed 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which  i reluctantly agreed  with as I  was not given  any other choice - but I  had to pay  all that domestic  ticket myself. Upon  entering the Gothenburg  Airport on the day of departure, I saw a  direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was  informed there is  another seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow  via Jersey. However,  by this point  he told me  they have to  charge a fee  of GBP 710  because I “changed  this flight a  third time”.   I find it  a disgrace that  they charge a  fee to change  a flight that  is cancelled, and  they were unable to give alternative options to reach  my destination in for the conference.  They proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted  BA for the  financial compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law,  and I got  immediate rejection as they claim I arranged my own  flight to my . If I  have a choice,  I will never  see BA again.  Absolutely awful customer  care and complete  failure of understanding  their customer needs."
10.0,"I would like  too thank all  our air and  sea crew for  providing the best  along with a very long journey! I don’t know  if you manage to keep smiling.  Cannot fault anything.  So reassuring, excellent  experience and I  can wait to  go again. Thank  you and I  really appreciated you."
10.0,"UK Airways personnel  were just magnificent.  The flight into  Dubai was delayed, security had long . I ran  like a madman  only find the  doors closed but  no plane was  still there… the  people at the  gate worked the  gate at 200  miles an hour to allow me  into board (the  pilot program was  also closed). This  alerted the flight manager, who came towards the gate, urging her to make a decision  since the plane  just about to  find its take  out spot in  case I was  pulled from the  gate still out  my breath while she handed me  her passport giving  me the green  card to board. I bolted again  to the plane feeling bad that  we did not  immediately thank her  and her magic.  We really hope  Diana gets recognized by British Airways for her performance.  Thank you for  all you do !"
4.0,Great flight apart from my seat  which was coming apart on39J and  lack of good leg room. Meal  tasted good from Singapore. Should be more snacks on board. My neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didn’t  fit
5.0,It was 1  hour late leaving gate. Crew were  making Seats comfortable.  In the complimentary  lunch provided was  1 bag of  fresh salted crisps.
1.0,"London to Istanbul. British Airways Business Class rows comprise  of three seats with the middle  seats empty. Front  row about 5-7 are considered as Business Class, with very short leg room  No pillows, no blanket,  No inflight service,  none were harassing . No curtesy for business Class check-in while waiting  between flights. "
2.0,"London to Manchester.  UK Airways is probably the worst  airport company I have ever flown  with they took 2 hours to  check the luggage , the flight was delayed by an hour. The staff were no  help and frankly rude."
2.0,Flight was cancelled  on the last  hour due to “weather” despite pretty much all other  airlines not being affected. Booked onto  a flight the  same day. Arrived at the airport 2.5 hours ahead : Horrendous check-in  & security delays meant we almost  caught the new flight. The flight  was fine once  we got on it but the  damage was done.
7.0,"After having a  couple not so  great experiences in  my past, I feel I have  to write a positive review as  to where it is deserved. First  off all, the  service in the BA lounge in  Barcelona is massive.  The buffet was a joy. We  arrived on a BA flight but  not by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff , the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this  type of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I  add that this  was business class  was not 11 % like last time, but 5 pm which was  certainly a big improvement and could 've felt in a much more  attentive service. I  have still not  agree on luggage being labelled ""priority"".  My luggage certainly  will not come out first in  the destination airports."
1.0,"The review is  a BA booking  is not a  review . Today  I clicked wrong  numbers on line,  big mistake and  had to pay  cancellation fee. I  just go to  BA booking” and  put on the  option to not  get a voucher,  and I received  a response saying my voucher is  on its way.  Please call them  to speak to  a gentleman who  I spoke over  Skype and would  he listen to  my concerns and  so I give  up and want  and book a  cheaper flight, obviously  with a much  lower price but  without the voucher  they didn’t want.  Due to my  disappointment I am  able to use  this voucher because  they can’t tell  them what it  costs until I  receive it at  the point in  my future that  they can’t say . So they  still have my  voucher and I  need to re-book  the full cost.  In the end  they order to  get me off  their phone they  give up."
4.0,"Flying to Seattle  to London. I  will never fly BA again. They  booked my return  journey from Heathrow  back to Manchester  and then cancelled  the alternative offered.  They had to  have our son  back all the  journey to London , pick us up and take  us to our  hotel in Manchester. The food was  terrible and on  the return journey , soon as  they had finished , they were  considering taking our  luggage so that they could settle  in for the  flight I will  never be flying  again again"
1.0,"The flight in March 2022 from San Francisco to London on 28th  February was cancelled  with 3 hours’ notice. We found out on the shuttle bus to  the airport. We  decided to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed  for our expenses  sent in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It  was the usual 30 min or  so time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to  take a return flight (my wife  was ill). This should not have been a problem  because the flights  are re-bookable. We  were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to  cancel we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone.  You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking  flight bookings ? All I have been offered is  a voucher. The time to use  had passed. It must be great to be a  business that can  offer endless A4 vouchers and not  see money paid  for services not rendered. We returned  home with Aer Lingus with no  explanation"
10.0,"I sat in  Seat 25C. Our  Cabin Crew lady , called Gina , she went above and beyond  and keep the customers happy. She  greeted us as we boarded with  her very cheery  smile she engaged  with two families  there with young  boys and gave  them games and  treats Her trolley  driver was excellent , she took great care in  who she was  carrying She had  stopped for a quick chat and  we think she said she was half German and half Bulgarian, a  really lovely young  woman who is a credit to  Qatar Airways."
9.0,"Late afternoon flight.  Had to fly  in time. Arrived . Uneventful flight. Good service. Pre pped drinks. Drink able meal. Coffee,  not available at  each AVML meal  was tasty. Hard  working crew on  this full flight.  It worked well."
1.0,"I was told  BA require a  48 hr negative  cholesterol test for  flying into Philippines.  Book my trip  to BA.com, with  no transfer in .. They delay  the transfer to  Singapore next day,  but not too bothered as have  the 48 hr negative covid test,  then when I  went to check  out at Changi  Airport the Philippines Airlines check in staff require a  48 hr negative covid test. Had  me rush to a different terminal,  breath tested, wait for the result,  rush back to  checking in ...the gate had closed.   Had to  book an extra  night in Singapore hotel, book my  return flight to  Bangkok then also  the return journey  back to London.  If one misses  the leg of  trip BA booked , the remaining  leg get cancelled.  I discovered  Singapore Air Business  Class and better  than British Airways,  for treating their  customer quality of  passengers the business class experience."
1.0,"Having been promised help to find a hotel room  as an outgoing  train from Heathrow  was running very  slow and my  flight would be closed, I boarded the plane on this basis. I  was subsequently dumped  at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. There was no  help at there  and find a hotel. I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia  did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people  helped me to an more secure area and toilet  and got me some sandwiches. I  left my holiday, my hotel booking,  and my music . BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to  see BA now  and they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing  me compensation for  which would have been a dreadful  day for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems  they have ditched the specific responsibilities  on Duty of  Service and towards Disabled Passengers. So for people with disabilities it's just not worth the  hassle of travelling with BA."
1.0,"I am a business class customer.  British Airways cancelled my return flight and chose an  alternate flight with  three stops. After I complained, they changed the date.  Once I told them the date would not work, they attempted to  bill me additional $5,000 for the change. I submitted a complaint and have not heard  back  If you try to reach out, no chance."
10.0,Bar Collins was  so helpful. My  friend & I  had flights separately  as we were  flying the same  airline but we  found out at  once in that  I was on  our slightly later one. Barbara was  quick to make  small changes to  when we flew  in & even  managed to put  us sitting together!  We appreciate BA!  We had a  pleasant flight over.  Their drinks &  meals were great  & staff were  super friendly. Looking  forwards to returning  again with BA.
10.0,"My husband, parents who are in  our 80’s and  I were traveling back to NY  via Naples, Italy and had a stopover at Heathrow, London. Let me just say we  did not happy when we arrived late to London  and missed our connecting flight back  in NY. The reason writing this review is the great customer service that Kashmir Dhami gave us. She was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same  flight the very  same day, which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so  it just made it all so difficult, but she got it done!  Nicole is so  sweet and is amazing at her job."

My  wife had a  crying fit, so  he asked (bell  rang 4 times for glass of  milk - all ignored. Last one  I told ""wait  until drinks are "".

8.0,"Just had a  great flight. pushed-off  was on time.  Airlines crew very  nice in all  aspects friendly for the most part  very well. Dinner  served and complimentary  beverages served in  premium economy very  nicely Do avoid middle seats though, even in premium economy. Only issue was with indifferent/non-helpful  customer call center  who refused to  allow one world status to select seat choice in ! Nice start to a 3  week trip to  Dubai"
1.0,"Christmas ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights I travelled from London  Airport to Amsterdam  with my brother, before boarding we  were told we  could take our cabin suitcases with  me in the cabin, so they sent them to  our cargo. At our arrival in Amsterdam, one of  my suitcases was missing, left at London Heathrow, so  we had to fill in a  questionnaire in Amsterdam, this was 3  weeks ago and  I still don't have the suitcase  and any information about it. Today  we travelled from  Amsterdam to London  City Airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin  bag and when I arrived in  Holland the suitcase  was missing, left in Amsterdam. 2 Suitcases, 2 different  ways they've ruined my holidays. No  refunds no dates , when will  i get my property back, no , lies and  no lies.   I was told  I could complain , and buy  back the things  I need, shoes,  some clothes, and  I might receive  my money back  within 30 days! Yes, I might."
1.0,After BA's promise  to credit double  my points for  a holiday booked  on their website I have received  two additional points  but my four email communications (including  from the Chief  who have remained : Do not  feel taken in  by this marketing  campaign - they  only want you to book a  vacation and then  do not follow  up on their  word Some things  you do not  exist at BA.
2.0,"This process is  slow responsive I have been following up on my refund since October, 2021 which is 9 months now. I have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to [email protected] several times and all they tell me is it’s  being processed. British Airways customer service  was bad and needs to be  acted on. Till today I have not received my refund. I am just wondering what is happening!"
2.0,"Customer service is  appalling For over a week customer 's number message said to call  BA in a  2 weeks. Nothing  I needed to  do could be done on BA.com I was flying to Nairobi to  meet my sister , after her  husband died suddenly,  both sister and  i had tickets on the July  flights from Nairobi to JFK. When BA received the  birth certificate, they  cancelled my sister's  name not once but twice. It  took almost 5  weeks to correct  the incompetence. My niece and my  niece were on  a phone for hours plus hold , 8 times we were told  from the web  phone number we  will get a  new call and no one ever called back. The  price was in premium economy. When  I tried to  arrange to be  on my broken- up sister, the  price was $4029.00  plus a $25.00  additional fee. Where 's the efficiency?  where is the empathy? Where is the decency? In  regards to the  pain of losing  her husband, my  sister had to  go through totally  unnecessary stress of not having a  job until 7  weeks before her flight. Also when I made my  reservation i was  promised a price  and within 10  mins was told  there was a  price increase. British  Airways has taken  another nosedive in my opinion. Words simply don't convey  the very deep frustration and disappointment with the company"
8.0,"Flying on A380 SFO to LHR. Smooth check in at San Francisco. Airport quiet and efficient. Dedicated BA  with excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff. Lounge was very  crowded though. Minor departure delay and onto A380 upper deck. I prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter. Old style product but clean and well . Staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals. On time arrival, baggage  is slow. A good flight overall."

Or  believe me you  can pre-order weeks  before you fly. However there is  no guarantee you 'll get your  order mine never  arrived so after  asking where the  bag was, they  told me they  had food for  someone who was  eating on the plane, that someone  informed me it  was out. They  never managed to  get my luggage.  And I am  just waiting for  someone to contact  us regarding it.  We will never  meet them again."
1.0,"My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included  the return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no  available seats available  on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked  seats on-line (which we hadn’t done).  Then We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15  mins still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security,  and see if we could get on the flight  to standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be  onto the flight  We were given boarding passes for  a flight to  DC but no  flight passes for  the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not  going thru to Washington but only to London. We  are told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us.  As we got  to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast "" Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due  of a delayed  departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London  45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins  after the scheduled departure, with a  simple explanation of  that isn’t enough , that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When  I got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly  formed in 3 hrs. When we  finally got thru on the phone,  they were informed that the best BA could do  with us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not  to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I  am not told  and assured I’d  get compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in  my hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a  request on-line. This ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to <mask> UK. "
1.0,"Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this  delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to  go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a  reservation for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This  flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London  before we were  going to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make  our own travel back to the Netherlands. Seems British Airways claims & refund process is non responsive, as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation, but received nothing yet. apart from  the automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight. "
5.0,Reasonably smooth boarding. Meal service was  very ad efficient but no ice or spirits available  and no room on the trolley - could they  have offered to serve this afterwards? Seat was very  cramped indeed on  the aircraft so  very little if  any sleep on the long overnight . Cabin crew spent much of the time between  flights talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we  could sleep even  though the seats were comfortable. This was so disrespectful and inconsiderate.
5.0,"Three flights, London , Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard,  though the seats and legroom are quite tight for  a three-hour flight. The cabin crews  seemed efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the  crew often missing on other airlines.  BA operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic  boarding and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at  least two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded  from the front and not from the back? This  was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense  ta board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour  flight to Iceland was just tokenism  that compared badly with what Air  France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to  stand wherever they could in the corridor."
7.0,"The typical BA  air shuttle flight.  Very special. Departure  20 minutes early , no one  could greet flight  on arrival hence  delayed 30 minute  wait Crew were  polite and charming.  Very clean cut  looking product that  when it works , is fine."
1.0,"Over 1 week ago I cancelled 2 Club Europe flights due to testing positive for  HIV the day before. They were booked many months ago and eligible for the Travel Voucher, so I opted for this online. Since then, absolute silence and BA pages state  refunds might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). As a very loyal BA customer for more than  10 years, I am appalled at  this absolute state of chaos that the airline now  has With a further 6 bookings with BA planned  for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare."
10.0,Flight delayed slightly  thanks to luggage conveyor breaking down.  We never made it to Toronto and we filed a lost baggage  complaint Within 24  hours our luggage  was in Toronto and a wonderful BA representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it  with me. Would  certainly give BA a 5 star rating and have  them again.
8.0,"Check in and security at LHR efficient. Went to Galleries North which was busy but  pleasant with good service. Left from  departure gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for  that at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy.  I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one  did pre order  meal in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able  too have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have  had the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from  us The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my  son from economy  which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend  to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight."
1.0,"Washington to London. Our flight was  just cancelled. My  family spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight. We were told  to the customer service representative that we should just  cancel our trip  ( spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc). When  she finally rebooked  it still lost  a day, one day of lodging,  and tickets to  one show. We tried to at least get another day on the  day of our  flight but no one could help us. No one  understood that our  entire vacation was totally altered and  cost us a bunch of money.  We are so  frustrated and angry with the customer service here!"
2.0,"Return to New  Orleans via London. British Airways has  caused me such  trouble trying to  book a ticket  to my uncle  has passed away,  having canceled a  flight instead for  a newly widowed  mother after they  altered her booking  from the original ! It is  now less than  3 weeks until  our scheduled flight, and I have  tried trying to  confirm her booking  and hours and  months I have  gone on hold,  never with an  email being told  when my query  has been prioritized  and that I  would receive a  call back within  48 hours. I  check every 2-3 days and nothing 's been done  to reinstate her , and no  one can ever  resolve the situation.  We will never  work with BA . Sure, flying  through them is  cheaper but their  total lack of  customer assistance has  caused distress and  stress and so  many hours of  flight time. And to think I  spent more money  for a ticket  from BA than  other cheaper carriers , it would  make my life . BIG MISTAKE"
1.0,"Today, my husband  with a friend flew from Dublin  to London City . All apparently  worked well from  Dublin through the . After that,  BA ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be  on full bloom.  They waited and  waited for our  luggage to come  from the baggage  claim but neither  the husband's nor  mine came. I found a BA  service person to  assist me. He  informed me that  they were 60  bag checked and 59 on the  ground  I  wanted one of  our bags made . Then, two  BA customers from the same flight  were complaining to  someone else that  we too, had  not gotten their . So, I  guess the 59  instead of 60  is some kind  if interesting fiction.  It was then  asked to file  our claim on  board which we  had At this , about 10 hours after our  bags landed, the system says they 've no idea  of our bags . Now, I've  had bags not  found on flights  more - less  and less as  I have tracked  the bags fastidiously  I usually fly  United Airlines which  tracks your bag  in every stage  in the flight  for updated info  ( e.g., ""Your  baggage was loaded  on the plane"";  the bag is  making its way to baggage claim"").  This doesn't seem to have anything like this. In  my case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate  the bag. I  have flown BA  for many years  and with experience I would never  use them again."
4.0,"British Airways is  poorly staffed at Venice airport. No  way to check in 2 flights departing within 15  mins of each other 1.5 hours ? Huge line  coming through airport.  Cabin crew fine. London to Baltimore segment on an  American 787, usually they are much nicer. Limited TV  and movie selections, wifi did not work. Flight crew ok, food adequate."
1.0,"I booked a flight for myself and my wife from Heathrow to Nairobi in Premium Economy using Frequent  Bird points. I  only paid $205  to reserve two seats on our  plane in a  4 configuration cabin, as I didn't  like to sit in a row of 4 people  as possible. A  two weeks before our flight BA  emailed me to  say they had  switched my seat selection. When I  checked in to see my new seat selection I had been moved  to a row of 4? The email also stated that if I  was happy with  my new seat selection they had  reserved for me, I could get  the full refund of the money I had paid.  I called to  cancel the reservation,  so they did, and I paid  my cancelation fee  before they refunded  the frequent flyer  fee When I  contacted them to  refund the fee  and my seat  selection they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable. I  gave them the email they had  emailed me when  I changed my  assigned seats, but  were repeated that  flight reservations are  also non refundable."
6.0,"We was about  twenty minutes late.  the A350 we flew on was  over eighteen months . The seating spacing in economy class seems very  tight and if  your seat in front is fully tilted back, it  becomes a real  pain to get  any of the  plane The screen  was so close  on your face  is becomes difficult  to focus on  the screen. Audio  was so poor due to music  dominating the conversation,  people gave up  attempting to watch.  My cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service,  and felt very disorganised. Felt sorry  about the cabin , they seemed to be working  late and there  seemed to be  no lot of up and down  the aisles on  this type of  plane - felt ! The overhead  lights are very  noisy and many  passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings  during the flight.  One tried using  the overhead attendant light to verify  my wife's meal  but no one  noticed - better  than stop a  BA attendant in the aisle. Nice  experience for a  four hour flight  - no fun for close to  three hours. I  was going to  research other options  when using BA again, the hassle  trying make contact with anybody before  the flight puts  me off before  I even go to the airport."
1.0,"Was going from Belfast to London but they cancelled  the flight, and we didn’t even  know it was cancelled. Someone behind  me had to tell us. we  missed a connecting  ticket and spent a lot of  cash on our holiday. the refund  took ages. Overall  very happy at  home "
1.0,"Third time getting poor service from BA. 1st, unable to contact via phone, email or website. 2nd even with four business  class tickets across the Atlantic, they do not allow free seat selection or check in until 24 hours prior to the  departure Do they understand what the last 24 hours of an international trip are like? By the time we confirmed our seats my wife  & our kids were spread throughout the plane. Of course no-one at the airport could  say anything. "
1.0,"Book a flight  from London to  Brisbane 2020. Trip was cancelled due to Covid lockdowns. We asked BA  airline for refund, told cannot do but will issue . We stated no good for  two elderly people from Australia as would not know when we can  fly Informed no other option and silly vouchers sent. Now they are  completely out of date and unusable!  Had been asking  for two years  about refund! Many  more emails. They keep saying we took vouchers! Had  little choice. Does anyone have any  other options re ? We would  feel most grateful.  Just not fair  they just take our money! "
1.0,"We left MIA late due to  some issue with the provisioning of the plane. We  landed late and so missed our connection at LHR  in CDG. At  first British Airways  put us on  NOT 1 but 3 flights to CDG and as such said I  actually took the flight to CDG and then cancelled my flight back  to MIA since  they did not  book my flight. They did credit my AVIOS for the one flight but said I  just took it. Thus I had to book on  different airline to return at the last moment. Trying to call BA  became a nightmare  phone hold for  over 1 hour, a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not  be helped as the person did nt know what  they do so he had us contact duty office  who does not  handle “flight only” problems feeding us  numbers to the number we just called and we’re  going to be  told BA cost me $5800 overall. We have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again. They  and new leadership have sunk to  less than a budget low cost airline in customer  experience while charging premium rates - don’t be fooled."
1.0,"The flight was delayed over 6 hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight , change to a different route, finally I lost  the luggage and no one has any information. I will never again  fly with British ."
1.0,"Terrible experience with  Brit Airways! I  felt obligated to check-in my carry-on suitcase due to my group number, according to the girl at the front desk. Then, they could miss  my two suitcases,  plus the luggage of my boyfriend,  which traveled with me. After 3 days, they delivered 2 of our 3 bags, and since then the  failure of deliver the last one persists. Now, already 10 days passed, and still no information of where the last suitcase is. Always the promise that the bag will be delivered today, but it never happens! No respect with the customer! First and last time with British Airways , sure! I don't recommend at  all"
1.0,"they cancelled my  flight I never  flew on it,  could book another and refunded about  one quarter of  what I spent  with their covid ance  I  had booked onto  the flight with  BA for April  of 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so  I looked at  arranging for a  new date; COVID  or flexibility assurances?  To find a  date up to  or including October.  If I opted  to the refund , I'd get a full refund.  It was refunded about 1/5 of  all I paid. I called their  contact centre for an explanation as  i couldn't fathom  how they could  stop the flight, not have any  additional flights available  but I didn't  get a full  refund Each phone call takes about  20 minutes before  you get to  speak to customer service. And thats  half the frustration ... The customer service people were  clear that a  full refund should  be given and  advised me to  wait while they escalate the case. A month later , about 6  phone calls later,  after 6 hours  waiting on the  line they finally  give me a  little more -  in total less  that 1/4 of  what I paid. It would seem  to get a  refund in increments  and would have had to call their customer service  for them to  send me round in circles until I got frustrated  to give up.  But instead of calling I enquired  about this via  the website ..  Waiting for an answer as to  why I wasn't  getting a full refund. I didn't  change my booking, neither was it  our fault they  decided to stop  going to HK.  After another month  spent waiting ...  this is the  reply they gave  me an email. Thanks for contacting  BA about your  request for EU . We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your  ticket to Heathrow on 29 April . Your claim's  been refused because BA0032 was cancelled  as of non payable commercial reason. Further to your  complaint I would advise to kindly  be in touch  through our customer support team to  check the status  of the refund,  for the same  are looked after  through our support  staff We take  very reasonable measures  which avoid disruption  on a flight  and we always  consider if there  is any other  possible solutions before  we make a decision. The cancellation  occurred out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule.  Thank again for following this up with us. Please  be free to  contact us if  we can help  with any further  and I hope  we have the chance to welcome  everyone on board again soon. Best  wishes British Airways Customer Relations"". I  didnt know what  the payable commercial  purpose is. I  was out about 250 sterling, going  and just leave  them their and <mask> this company."
1.0,"Belfast to London , 20 Jun,  2017 I was  told at about  BA flight BA1427  has been delayed  until 0915, will only reach London Heathrow at 1025.  I reached the  terminal at 0445, but BA counter  was only open at 0510. At  BA counter, I  asked BA ground  desk for advice as I have  a connecting Singapore  Airways flight at  London on the  same day. The reply was “it is the customer’s  right to contact  that airline, there’s nothing we can , I was  handed a card with contact info  from BA customer service and sales. For the next  4 hrs in the airport, I  have been trying  and contact BA,  I was told  their hotline only operates from 0800,  you have to  ring another number  with “urgent cases”,  so ever number I dial, I just couldn’t get to speak to any one till . Again, I  got told that there’s nothing they  will do because  their connecting flight is Singapore Airlines.  On the aircraft,  which I approached  to help with my luggage to  being placed to the compartment, I  was told that  is the customer’s responsibility to do  everything on their  behalf  I would think twice  and take BA in the future."
4.0,"Overall customer service  for British Airways  are really bad.  You can't reach  their call centre  even even after  flying for 30 mins. Now, I  do appreciate Emirates  or Turkish Airlines  are facing BA's  low quality customer ! Not only  poor customer service ; the food  on offer during  the long haul (LDN-JNB) is really  poor quality. Other  airlines operators which  is working with  them for flight  booking are way  better than BA. I guess BA  has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co. Overall  my rating is  low for BA  and you can  see how stingy  they is when  we fly with  them Note: Respect ing their cabin  crew"
1.0,"BA is still  the premium airlines , however delivering  much better than  what a low  price offers. Seat  do not recline,  lift is minimal  for anyone taller  then 1.60m a ft to fly  like being in  a sardine can.  The old times  for being a glamour flying BA  are far gone.  Air force almost  drops to 0,  plus a very  generous pack of  tea and water.  The only positive  thing is the  friendly crew always  looking for you  when happy, or  just pretending at  least For the  prices they charge  and advise every  passenger to fly  any other low  price airline as  their alternative. You  get extra for  absolutely nothing."
4.0,"Flying a new  route which BA  introduced at the  beginning of June  following several years of Covid related . The business  Class experience was I fear typical  of the nickel & dime policies  used by the  airline over the  past decade. Plus  the helpful and  helpful FA. Minuses ? The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats , Each pod  contained surprisingly little  room with only very limited storage space. It was  hard to adjust the seat, particularly  causing it to  be flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment  is very limited  - a poor  mix of films,  sports programmes and  music The food choice and quality  was poor -  none of the three mains was  empty and my pea and mushroom  sandwich was almost  double the cheese  selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings  of BA's rivals  flying similar routes  are like, but  the experience does  somewhat match up to that provided  to Singapore Airlines on their flights  to the Far East and Australasia."
5.0,"As a regular  British customer on  international flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue  their slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low  fares airlines is they they don't  hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots  used to be some of the best for updating status, but this  have dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The  seating standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff  said he had  only been given 10 menus for  his customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago). Staff ing was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin. I end where I started, BA standards continue to slip. "
1.0,"Why now do  not use British ? When booking,  we said we would have enough time between the  connecting flight to final destination, but  I was wrong. Flight to London  was late, we auto missed our flight to Edinburgh,  so had to  wait 9 hours  to the next flight. Coming back  and again flight leaving was late,  time to run  to get connecting , then we sat on tarmac  over an hour  before luggage had  a go on  hold I thought , that is  not my luggage. Once back in Boston luggage did  NOT show up.  We said we  would get it  in 24 hours and we didn't, so far it will be at  home 2 days."
1.0,"I could very  much understand losing  my luggage for 8 days with  how airports are . This was  a risk I  became well aware  of when travelling  from Greece for  our wedding. However,  after my many attempts to receive  support from this  firm it has  been nothing but  silence and upset.  The company at  some point was  hung up and  just hanging up on my husband.  The most recent  interaction I have  contacted them, is  when I requested  an agent from  the luggage team  send me a timeline of my  current location, the man on the  phone verbatim stated:  What if I … After this he proceeded to  inform me my  flight was in  touch with WestJet,  stating that this  were “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not  taking me off hold. I did  not book with  them is this  my luggage issue  they have been  fine when I  had called them  they have given  them the most  trouble out of everyone). I will  not use this  service again nor  contact anyone that  I am close  to This has been completely disheartening.  Please please do not use this  airline if you  do like your  airline to have any chance of  going smoothly or  a chance of  receiving adequate or  even any information  and communication. I  had never in  entire life been  upset like this  from a customer before."
4.0,"BA A80 is  one wonderful aircraft  - quieter than  any other aircraft  ever flown. Flight  slightly delayed arriving  at Vancouver from  London which meant  that departing flight  to Vancouver was  further delayed. Passengers  waiting almost 90  mins at London  Airport 5 for  it to arrive  - excuse given  from BA ground  staff was that  the baggage staff  were ""very busy  right now"" and our baggage will  come ""soon."" Onboard  food and services  very disappointing. Seat  not reasonably spacious , did not  offer sufficient back . Meal sizes  were portions considerably  larger than when  you last flown  with BA -  one tiny ham  and cheese croissant  with breakfast. Cabin  service noticeably absent  in cabin during  flights - no  mention of water,  coffee or other  beverages during the  trip Overall, a  very disappointing experience  with BA."
8.0,"Flight to SFO  in new Club ! Rather chaotic embarkation despite small  number of passengers. Pushback delayed by  arrival of tug.  Premium Suite seats , a huge  upgrade over previous CW product, with  full IFE and  very good range of movies. Cabin  staff attentive and  Fast Food adequate  but still served on the same tray. Arrival more or less on  time but delayed by lack of marshal to guide  me to the air bridge. Long queue to get through immigration."
2.0,"The form is  incorrect - Called customer service twice  3 different times  and they hung  up due to  being too busy  and pick up  a phone. 1  hour flight delay  I was first in the queue  but had to  wait in my  checked luggage due  ot there being  not enough room  which was untrue , most storage compartments where empty when I entered  the plane. I  realised that I really cannot afford  the wait on  extra luggage as  I have 3  wheel drive left  when I arrive  to the airport.  In short: totally not customer friendly.  will try to  try flying next time with BA."
5.0,"Feels like BA are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. Very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew.  Sadly it was  over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but  the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else -  like water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't  look at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came  out after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed  very under-staffed or  given poor procedures.  Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very  quickly Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick,  without delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using  them for business class or where there is no alternative. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this  particular point?"
4.0,"Back to London  airport and then  onto Hamburg. Despite  the 4 hour layover in Heathrow, bags didn't make  them onto the  return flight. Once in Hamburg, there  was no one  on the baggage  claim desk and the number provided  became a dead-end; no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee. A  group of passengers  with missing checked  bags waited in the airport and  tried every outlet  available (check-in desk,  private baggage tracing  and calling, emails)  for two hours  with no avail. The solution for  us was to  print out a  slip of paper with contact info  & baggage description.  Two days later,  no information where my luggage is and no way  of contact customer . Absolutely miserable customer support. Our  flights were alright , after such  terrible customer service  we will never fly BA again."
1.0,Best airline experience ever. Flew 7  in business class.  Getting in was a disaster. The claimed I had  no tickets. After 1.5 hours at  the ticket counter  I were given  our passes. We  booked group 1  and the delay  causing us to  leave much later. The connecting flight  got cancelled leading  into a day long layover with 4 children including  an infant. The ultimate connecting flight  was also 2  days late. Then they lost our  luggage 4 days later they still  dont have our luggage. Calling the  number for lost  items results in a 30 minute to 1 hour  wait after which you are disconnected  before speaking to anyone. This airline  is a complete  scam please do  never fly them. </s>
10.0,My crew BA656  of 6 June absolutely made this ! Smooth journey  by possibly the nicest crew I've  yet had. Rebooking  for September we 're that impressed.
10.0,"I travelled on the 11th April with my baby , economy class, flight BA 2260 and BA 2508. I had the pleasure of meeting Sarah air stewardess.  She was absolutely amazing. I received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond. It was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated.  She repeatedly asked if I needed anything as I  had Arham in my lap most of the time. She held him whilst I had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft. We had  great chat and the service was just amazing. It is something I will never forget. Thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight. I have  worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated. Hope you see this."
10.0,"Excellent inflight service  for the crew.  So professional and  polite The very  definition of British. Even though the  plane was delayed  thanks to chaos  with ground staff at Vancouver, it didn’t matter. The  team made the flight outstanding."
9.0,"First trip to Boston, departing LHR , Ground staff  are absolutely fantastic  and made an  incredible effort to  be sure we  were prepared for  both the COVID C requirements in  The US, they  seemed really friendly  & personable. Very  few queues for  our drop and  landing I would  imagine it took  around 20 minutes  on kerbside to  land which is  good considering what 's going on  in the UK  in the moment.  It was very  quick and efficient  and was completed  within 30 minutes.  Sitting on the last row of  rows I really  appreciated the low  back 3-3-3 layout  for economy compared  against the 10  seat seating. Myself  or my colleague  had booked the  same seat either  end of the  aisle and were  close enough to  have no one  in between us  which really helped.  As most of  the foot space  on these older  planes is taken  up by the  overhead box it  really helped and  may have been  much less comfortable  have we been  sat next to  one other. The  cabin crew were  really well trained  and personable they  were very visible  throughout the flight  but pro-actively offered  assistance outside of  customer service. Meal  service was very efficient with cabin  crew pro-actively removing  plates from people  who had finished  meals something that  is very rarely  done in economy.  Fast food by  far was exceptional,  we don't think  anyone eaten so  much on a  long flight in ! It will  prove interesting to  try it on  our return flight  if its catered  as an out-station. Overall it was  another great flight,  hampered by the  extra space we  had but nonetheless  a good performance  for BA which  far exceeded my  standards based on  other reviews here  and elsewhere. I 'd definitely consider  booking with them  again"
9.0,"My son travelled alone for the  second time to pursue his studies  and we were  very concerned about  the issues he  might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines..  Luckily his flight  his experience was  good with no  complaints and reached Toronto in time.  We are thankful to British Airways  for provide a  hassle free flight  for my son,  even after the  problems the airlines  had gone through due to pandemic. Unfortunately, people with  bad experiences do  sometimes post their  experiences skewing the  airlines negatively. The  airline was very  stressful though as  he booked late,  before being dumped  from Air Canada  or Swiss air,  as they cancelled  our flight at  very last moment."
1.0,"As a seasoned  pilot and a  loyal BA customer , am appalled  by the company’s  appalling drop in . We were booked to fly  the ZHR-LHR on  a miles ticket  in February 2022.  When we arrived  at check in  2 hours before  our scheduled departure  and were informed  that we would  need to pay for our baggage  fee though our  ticket clearly included  free checked baggage. We were held  in check in  waiting over an  hour whilst the  checking in agent  attempted to consult with her manager , then confirmed  that we would have to pay  to check in  our baggage. We  had no option  than to pay  that charge however  as a result  to this delay  the check in  arrived at the  terminal to find  out our flight  was closed. As  ours was the  last flight of  the day we were forced to  book expensive overnight  hotel accommodation. I  attempted contact BA  Consumer Services after  this incident on  each occasion however  he didn’t bothered  to respond. At  our 3rd attempt,  where I cc 'd CEO on  the complaint I got a one  page response saying  yes there was  another free baggage  available with our  booking At this  point I got my solicitor to  sign a letter and they finally  decided to refund  the baggage charge.  However they are refusing to compensate  me for the  cancelled flight and the considerable expenses and loss that  I incurred as  a result of  the mistake."
8.0,"Boarding on time, but unfortunately from ORT’s worst boarding gate, which obviously was beyond BA’s control. Crew were  good but lacked the personal touch.  Business style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space, and the 777 was showing it’s age. However we were told the  plane was being taken out of  use the following week to be upgraded to the  premium club suites.  The cabin crew were good, food ok, wines a little disappointing. Overall , decent flight."
1.0,"Long delays can  occur but the  fact BA handles  these incidents in  is way beyond.  My flight was  delayed overnight, our connecting flight was  and the overall  delay resulted in  less than 48  minutes Rechecking our bags took 4  hours standing in  line A rebooking  for an earlier  booking was denied,  do it online or at the  gate Will certainly  never fly BA  again and do  NOT recommend this  airline"
1.0,"Flying in easy  at BGI due  in us checking  in and finding the flight was  late by nearly  2 hours, no  help from the  airline so other  customers arrived earlier.  Fast boarding in  limited numbers. Seat is a joke for 8 hour , no leg room on isle seat of 4,  a seat in  the frame blocks  from stretching your  leg and once the passenger in  back reclines its  getting worse. Food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had  ran out before the stewardess had  got to my  seat (only choice ) water or  sparkling wine. The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with  no contact from  the airline, I  only found out trying to book  a seat on  both return legs,  as no alternative  option provided. We  had to privately book a taxi  from LHR to  MAN for 4 pm as this  turned out cheaper  on the train.  The outbound flight was also a  disaster no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was  stressful and stressful  to older relatives travelling with us. Overall shocking from British Airways and  I guarantee I  would never use  it again."
1.0,"British Airways - Travel with Confidence. Probably the most unsuitable tag line, they should be . Back in October I booked  my holiday to  Gran Cana with BA only to have it cancelled early in 2022.  Then last year I also booked Heathrow to Malaga for a family wedding in May. Guess what, a few weeks ago  that also got cancelled. I had  my chance to rebook with BA , with so many cancellations planned  it was not  willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such  a important event,  so applied for and received a refund. I have now also asked  all my Executive Club account to be closed as  I shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a  waste of an . My suggestion , if you want to 'travel  with confidence' choose another airline. Any airline."
2.0,Middle class seating  described as a  detailed configuration on  the website is  cafeteria style with an unsold middle  table - not  the more comfortable  and economy. Meal  options started with  vegetarian options but  got down to  4 options by  rows 5 (out of 8 in  this class) and  by row 6  as we were  fortunate only one  amongst us had  salad options then  the grilled tofu  options available for  most rest of  my class.
1.0,"We arrived 3  a half hours  before our flight  and queues to  board was terrible.  Our airport security  guards were not  as well. The  airport was closing  when we arrived , jogging to  the gate (with ). It was  By far the  hardest travelling experience  we have ever  seen that i  have experienced. All  major airlines should  send out a  policy that you  must arrive at  the 4 hours  late to have  a enjoyable experience.  This is the  best airport I 've experienced. "
1.0,"BA says that  flights are flexible and cancellation is  possible within 24 hrs. That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8  hours after booking,  i need to change my flight. I assume I will get a refund like their  site says I will - that 's apparently a  lie They actually give me a . To request  the voucher I  need to sign  off that I agree to the  deal despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not  receive it for  another week.  I am panicked  and I try calling them. Of  Course calling them does nothing. The hotline says that  they are too . This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the  information online despite no guarantee of  accuracy or timing.  But it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then  they need to change my booking . I go to request a  discount again. This  year the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing  to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class  support line (which  i am not  the member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help . They do  a thing on  the back end  and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will  refund me in  24 hours."
1.0,"I have been  pursuing a long  overdue refund with  BA regarding a  ticket originally booked  for 2019... The  flight was cancelled,  another voucher was issued, another flight  was booked using  another voucher, and  then again cancelled.  After trying to  return the voucher  for a new  airline BA kept  claiming I couldn't  prove the voucher  has been used.  I asked them to check the  location of that  voucher (as it  was left) and  their agent advised  they didn't have  access to that ... Two years  later I managed  to speak to  BA who recognised  that either a  refund or refund  is due and  left a note  in my record.  I then decided  no pursue a  refund as felt  it would be  too problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a  Priority One phone  call they said  I will be with me in 18 working days.  They then chased  them it was  long overdue. I was then told  BA will be  contacting me in 21 working days.  The refund never came. I try  hard to get  on to Customer  Services for the  automated system to  which no agents  where available. I have also sent  several follow up  email via the  airline reference link  BA sent me,  for an update,  again with no  response Honestly feel  really let down  by BA who , until this, I felt were  the more trustworthy  & reliable airline.  I suspect they  may have ruined  many trusted relationships  of customers by now."
1.0,"When I tried to check in, they required a  Certificate of insurance for Covid travel,  which I did  NOT have it, I tried for over 2 hours  to get it  signed but my  branch (where I had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was  saying it was 18:30. After a very long time,  I got a cover letter which the bank sent  for me, but  only to be  told I had missed the check in by 2  hours They would  not let me board, and I missed the flight.  Next I contacted BA, and tried  the rebook another  connecting flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing  flight my return  flights had automatically been cancelled and this was BA . So then they worked out a new price  to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for  the flights. I  finally did a  look on Google  which found flights  costing £1100, flying  off with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on  that same flight I was originally supposed to return ! Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not  see anywhere on  the site that  BA needed the  insurance document. When  I checked in for the Mauritius  direct flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and I had a lovely flight with no issues. Every time  i fly with BA, I have a bad experience and I promise I will never fly with them  anymore "
3.0,"Second dreadful mediocre experience with BA to Malaga. This time boarding was by bus and to a remote  village with no Aircon. Then on  arrival the the  service was erratic  and guests couldn’t  buy food or drinks. Then the  online payment system didn’t work so we gave up on ordering. Finally  in Malaga we were held up  but not allowed  to leave the plane as the  crew had to  take off first , case 'we'  want the plane to go unbalanced? … It’s all one excuse after  other with BA these days."
2.0,"Basel to Johannesburg via London. Cancelled connection flight: confusing : still shows  my booking in  all bookings, never  get a confirmation email for new  booking  Cant check-in. Could check-in online or via  the app. Customer  support is non-existent.  In line, after 45min still no  people there to help me check in."
4.0,"Very low standards  for Club Europe: there was no  seat divider in  this aircraft, so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected,  also not properly  organised in Athens (there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket). No in-flight information as the  original flight maps  have long disappeared from European routes which is a  problem Staff was attentive though and tried their best."
8.0,"This flight was  never affected by  technical problems with  turbulence and I  am quite impressed  at the British  Airlines Premium Economy  experience in a new Boeing 787. Overall, Premium Economy turned out to  feel premium and clearly a step up from Economy  & Business Class.  Also the Premium  Class product came  across much better in the Boeing  777 than in  the old B747 , even than  in the B777.  It was very  comfortable and had nice leg room.  Great service and  entertainment options were  great Clearly worth the extra money  for Premium Economy."
1.0,"British Airways continues to decline in customer service. I used to love this airline and now I have had three poor experiences back to  back regarding their  customer service on  my phone with flight changes and  refunds The most recent experience has cost me $3000  higher than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company. Even as part of the Executive Club (Silver) I continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support. At this rate, they have lost my trust."
3.0,"On my flight  to LAX to LHR I paid to pick my seat for my flight back to LAX. I saw the $116 come out of my account the next  day As I’m adding in my booking the day  of my flight, the website tells me I no  more have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has been sold to someone else. I spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told  to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriate but I still reached  them anyway because  they was unable  to find another way to contact . On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent  could help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread.  After about 6  months of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being  unable to find  the chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a  different seat, however , was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to  bring up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed  my page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was  a success then never add the  reservation I’m not able to find the chat line  anymore and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues again.  Still extremely frustrated."
10.0,"Amazing flight and  landing The premium economy seats have been upgraded with  extra leg rest.  Great aircraft. Staff  were friendly and  helpful The food was great, beyond  measure"
2.0,"I booked a flight to London and paid, months in advance, to  reserve my seat  at an isle  of exit row (front of the  row + more legroom). Upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given  up to someone , and I  had left to  find a miserable  little seat near the toilet. I spent an entire afternoon calling customer  service If my call went through at all (the automated system simply  hangs up when  it decides they  are too busy)  I was placed on indefinite hold,  complete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered.  I was greeted  with someone with  very heavy accent,  and a very  high quality, hard  to hear line  I am 32  ( not deaf).  Sometimes they would  intentionally hang up before I said  something Other times,  I would purposely  give up after I stated my plight. IF I  tried to persist  through all of  this for hours on end, they  would hang up purposely after ""needing""  or put me  on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor.""  In the end,  someone managed to swindle me for  thousands of dollars, and I booked with another airline  on principle. "
1.0,"We are on our way home  after a 3 week holiday in the UK and  have had all  booked flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great  due to the friendly staff and there were no  problems however, the 2 long haul  could have been a nightmare. Our  return flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a  terrible flight, the staff seemed very  annoyed they ran  OUT of certain  meals and drinks and as we were in economy right at the  end we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was  just not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the  checking in process was horrific. I  had booked through  BA and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in  luggage allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended  with having to  book an additional  ticket for my  bag after being  advised to try do it under lining my booking on the app which was not  successful and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get  access to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked  for speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told  instead they have  their customer service desk in the  same BA terminal.  So Overall it  cost us about  3 hours to get me checked in after speaking  with about 6  other staff members, none of which could help me.  It was also  another discrepancy with  our baggage allowance , my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I  am told it was overweight as I was only  given 23kg and the bag was 24kg. Compared to  being flown with  other airlines I will never fly  on BA again, the level of service is shocking  compared to what you would expect."
10.0,I would like  say thank you  all the great  hospitality I am a handicap and  the family and  friends were afraid of this trip  as I was  traveling alone and  with a layover  to London of a few hours. I had to  switch terminals and everything but thanks to a great  staff my trip was amazing. They  showed great care  to me and  made sure I was doing well throughout the whole flight.
8.0,"We connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of  their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record  for me. The  management met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the  very professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the  journey The messaging  between cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company  offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work,  it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit."
10.0,"we flew from  London to Heathrow  Friday the 24th  February 2022. Check  in was very  quick and we cleared security in  just 15 minute,  quickly made our  journey up to  the lounge which  also has the  basic essentials but  is clean and  tidy When boarding  time came we  received priority boarding , was the  last few to  be welcomed by  the cabin crew , given wipes,  once seated we  were more or less on tme  after the safety brief taxiing for  drop off. Once  boarding it was  then time for  some drinks and  catering services, choice  between 3 main  food options which  are very good,  supported by very  friendly crew, the  crew kept us  relaxed about the  time of the  flight arrived at  home slightly early.  Had a very  pleasant trip. We 'll be flying  back with British  Airlines"
1.0,"I have always chosen to not  become a big  part of the  poor service, delays,  dirty aircraft, over  packed lounges, cabin  queues etc experienced  over the years  and have lost all patience with  this airline. Having paid almost £1K  just to change  a return flight for the family, to get a  ticket at a specific time, BA cancelled this and placed us on  this flight almost  3 hours later.  It was no  time to get  any of the  two available flights.  Our business class lounge at LHR  is packed with  not any space to move. The  lounge was filthy  with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor.  My seats were . Food for  first class passengers  and bread rolls  thrown in a  bag The poor level of hygiene,  long delays, cancellations makes this the  only airline I have had to  fly "
1.0,"Business lounge was closed at Pisa  airport which was  clearly beyond the  capacity of British Airways but as  they had been closed since January  the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for  this service vouchers to be used  in the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they  could credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that  point felt BA had handled the situation in a  reasonable and professional manner. However that was seven weeks  later and no Avios points have been added to  my account, I  have called their call centre multiple , at one  point being put on hold for an hour to put through to  a right department,  after the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to  ring a number  it was read  aloud to me  it was the  wrong number I  was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about  20 times now, it is clear  why BA have  every intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go  round in circles  until they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling  for the way  they treats its customers."
1.0,"Our Good Friday flight was delayed  over 5hours, STD  at ATD 18.00  in Durban, South  Africans from Johannesburg. There were no  announcements made, when  indeed no time  frame was given,  we simply didn't know. An aircraft  needed to be towed from a hanger at Johannesburg. Crew arrived late.  The aircraft was  cancelled We shall never fly Comair , that includes Kulula or BA BA shocking service."
1.0,We had a trip with 4  days included. All 4 flights were delayed. The worst with 2h15min. Also  one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to  a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short  time No explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or  refunds I expected  a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good results. This was a really bad experience and I will avoid using BA for any further travels.
9.0,"My first time in the new Club World suite.  Has lots of space and privacy,  a good seat.  Really doubt if  it can be bettered. Good staff as ever. My  biggest quibble is  when the food  is all served  at once. BA needs to roll this out quickly!"
1.0,"I had an Incredible rude check in staff at the British Airways counter in Nice on 16th April  with Zero empathy towards me a struggling customer. Second situation happened when  I arrived into Nice Terminal 1 on BA0262 13 April where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery. When our luggage arrived  in Nice airport  a day after and received an email from the AVIA Partner lost  & found (British Airways Partner) at 13:14PM informing us that our luggage has now arrived in Nice. After multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that I did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in Monaco, it was vital we received the luggage  and the lady replied “If it is so important why don’t you  try and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up” despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning.  That has been an appalling experience."
1.0,"we booked a  first class flight  through Qantas from Melbourne to Glasgow  from London. As  we fly to Heathrow, British Airways  was their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from  Melbourne to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were  due to leave,  I received an  emailed from British Airways, advising that  our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow  has been cancelled.  They help us , the email , they had  already booked us  on another flight leaving from London  Victoria Airport, which  was 26 miles  outside Heathrow Airport  so the flight  only going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow.  No sure how we were supposed  the get from  there additionally it  came in economy,  then business class  as though we had booked business  class originally. We booked this as  the connecting flight  letting British Airways know that we 'd just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in  their email about compensation for the  choice of class , additional travel  time in getting  from another airport, nothing about possibly  not accepting the flight given it  was obviously never  going to work  on us and  NO contact details  of British Airways. They also sent the email on  the Friday so even when I  could eventually find a contact number,  their office was  busy I have  not experienced such  poor customer service with any airline  we have ever  travelled on and  I can guarantee I will never fly British Airways again. "
7.0,"The service was very good, the  flight crew were  extremely kind and  even boarding was  very quick for an aircraft of  its size. The  cabin was comfortable  for economy and  as the A380 s are still  facing outwards on  their first floor,  this was a  lot of space.  The food was  decent for airplane food. The only  disappointing thing was  that ife screen  was quite outdated  and wasn't good , however there was a large selection of movies  and TV shows"
4.0,"Total chaos for  the immigration at  Manchester Airport. Boarding  was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed  by lunch with  the choice of  4 entrees. Food  can best be  described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of  many France, Swiss , Lufthansa short  term business class meals. Menu is  sadly missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have  been reintroduced. I  never mind, but  for European trips  until 2022, BA  was charging up to 3 times  their fare levels  until 2019, and the overall value  for money is  becoming very poor.  The WiFi did  NOT work from  begin to finish of the flight.  Captain said it had worked on  their way out and the Captain  has contacted London to get it  working on the return. BA is becoming more and  more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time  someone took some responsibility for their  mistakes"
10.0,"Shout out to the help desk at Heathrow, we arrived to late  and make our flight and the lady (with 32 years exp) was  brilliant she had  one tough crowd to deal with and was very  accommodating and helpful in getting us a place to stay, food to eat and a flight home the next day."
1.0," I am constantly amazed how British  airlines continue to get things wrong . I pretty  well though they 've covered all those bases and  for the last 15 years living in the UK, I have watched  them decline with great sadness. My  journey to Paris was no exception.  not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we  waited on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour  while we waited for catering to be loaded on  board and then  just left me ? As they barely offer any  customer service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle  of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought  this was good operational planning to  move a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in  first class could  all eat a poor quality meal  for the flight to Paris. As it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and  missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attend. Never again."
3.0,"The short haul  flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all  hoped for. We  booked out flights very carefully so  when we were  flying on flights  in the Club  of Suits not  a Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we  had to put  up with the  Yin yang which  really should have  probably pensioned off  years ago! Most business class offer  10 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one  long haul leisure trip a year  to Business Class  I always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception  that having paid in full on  my non refundable  flight not to  be allowed to reserve my seats.  Any points gained  from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze  status but we  were not given this status until  AFTER the trip  so it is  available to us.  Bronze status would have allowed us  to book the  seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather  then the 24  days when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a  reserved seat but  after boarding after the doors had  shut there was  another window seat still vacant. I  wondered if I  should move and was told by the FA she  should check. Nothing happened but after  checking a passenger  had moved from  me to that ! Judging by the interaction between  passengers I would  assume it was  an on Staff . I think it disgraceful that  the full fare  a passenger should  being treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we  were not offered  any drinks service before supper but  were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had  they done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it.  In summary would I ever fly with BA again?  Certainly not if  I had half a chance of  going with another airline. "
9.0,"A very comfortable (new suite) flight with great service and good food.  Service was wonderful New seat is  comfortable except the  chin strap is  still uncomfortable. Entertainment  and Wifi was annoying, cutting off , needing constant reconnecting. Generally a positive experience."
1.0,"Brit Airways is the most terrible  airline I’ve dealt . They have  brought our family  with stress and  anxiety - we  have tried for a week now  and speak to  them as we  never make the  flights online. They hang up on  us every time you call them , we have  become driven to despair by their  lack of their  services You can’t  sign in online,  the application sucks so much you’re better off trying  and code your  own app and it’ll probably work  but every time you try to  log in you  get taken to  the page that  says we can’t verify your documents  on the app  and website say  you verified and  free to go.  You upgrade and  apply for upgrade and it says  nothing guaranteed and  then when you go to check in which you  have to go  in the airport for because online  doesnt work, they give you a different seat than  you paid for  in a lower class and offer  nothing in return.  And I hope I never have the misfortune of  getting stuck flying  a British Airways  ever again."
2.0,"British Airways is the most terrible airline I’ve ever dealt with. They  have caused our family extreme stress , disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make  any changes online. They hang up on you every time you call  in - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. I have no choice  than to cancel  any chance of a life time trip we’d booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with  their airline and would have been  staying in Japan as BA just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers."
9.0,"BA is getting  some real bashing  on this forum  but I thought  I buck the  wind and report  a virtually flawless  review of a  smooth hop from  London to LCY  on BA8703 this Monday. Easy check  and decent lounge  staff except the  overly amiable staff  were still forced  me serve from  behind barriers, very  nice plane which  arrives on time,  small amount of  seats in 2D  which is a  better seat but  still lots more  seats than 1A  & C), reasonable  buffet breakfast served  in a very  friendly and capable  driver and arrived  20 mins earlier than scheduled. What's not to like, which is my  general experience with  this vast majority  on my BA 's over the  past 25 years.  And I thought  I would be  fun to read  a positive review  at once."
8.0,"New Club Suites are amazing, the  only let down is the bed is a little  too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow I have ever used. Food  was ok as  we have had better on BA  from the past and I can understand why they  have everything on  the single tray  but is OK. The cabin crew were brilliant but  I was surprised  that after dinner the crew didn’t  just come round with beverages or even bottled water. BA really have a great hard product here and  one would suspect  that soft product will improve once  the restrictions become less of an  option Well done BA."
7.0,Very small plane for a busy route. Service was good but food  more so. Ran out of a  hotel and options  there were not good. Cabin crew for BA actually really friendly.
1.0,"I continue to charge a premium for the most  reliable service, provided  by people who  cannot be in customer service, on  a dirty and  unreliable aircraft. Out  the 11 flights this year, not one has managed  the depart or  arrive at their destinations on-time. Including  my 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative  premium economy being  offered still no refunds 3 months  later and had a flight late , missed connection,  and BA cancelled  my rest of my ticket, leaving  us stranded in  a US. "
5.0,"Got back on  to Bridgetown to  stay in the old Club Class.  Another huge disappointment  at going out in the new Club Class suites  but the end  - this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough. Even  having to pay BA's extortionate pre-booking rate for our  seat - none  got to choose  2 weeks ahead. My wife and  me were stuck in the middle  class seats of 4 - 13E  13 F. Good job it was an overnighter so  we managed to  relax a bit and not have  to climb over  our neighbours very  quickly The March  flight selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though  their policy has changed regarding flying back to a  face wearing destination  ( London). Sort it out BA.  Started off 20 mins late but  no tailwind so  more than made  for the time  and a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast -  pretty dire. My  first smoked salmon bagel was dreadful. As usual when BA is good, it's really good , when it's  bad it's awful. I recommend hesitatingly  - come on  BA be great again. We pay  A lot for  our seats."
1.0,"The worst budget airline I’ve ever  had Far worse than Ryanair and  still refuse to  fly with them even though they’re basically free. BA charge about 10x  as much as other budgets but  have the worst service. Spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they  cant connect to  their internet, then  leave 50% of  the luggage behind  because they would have had to  cancel everyone’s flights  so they waited  about 10 mins  while the other luggage trolleys to  leave It took three days to  do it and cost us £100s. Then on return I’ve now been  stuck here nearly two hours and  found no sign of our luggage again. I don’t know how a company can be  that incompetent but  will be pursuing for compensation. I  have some free  vouchers from Amex , I won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through  this again."
5.0,"First, the actual flights are fine and the staff  on all 3 flights (ZRH-LHR, GVA-LHR & LHR-ZRH), first 2 in Economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are a credit to the company. The infrastructure  here is appalling.  Its impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff  to check-in everyone  on 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an  hour delay to sort this out. GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow  an aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due  too slow gate staff. Even when  I check-in online  they have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! There are more examples, and  besides this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline. Onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10."
2.0,"Have not flown economy with BA for years, what  a shock! Hard  plastic seats, small aged tv screens , limited inflight entertainment. Food and service appalling. 13hr plus flight, no socks, eye shades, ear plug amenity pack. And no antibacterial wipes offered. Wi-Fi advertised but  NOT available on flight. Paid premium money for a budget airline, more akin to Easy Jet, RyanAir or  Delta My last time travelling with BA after more than 18 years of flying with  a BA you really do need to buck up your service and  be the flagship Service you used to be."
9.0,"Back to Barbados  in March on  plane 255 in  a new Club  Deluxe suite. A  vast improvement on  my old yin  and yang Club  suite which we unfortunately endured on  the way back.  Nice big TV 's with high  resolution picture and  stereo headphones, plenty  nice nooks and  corners for storing  electronic items and  staying private. Nice  staff FA's (called by my name from the off)  and pretty good drinks service with  a good dinner . Once again  put down by  a poor (at best) choice of  sound on the  onboard entertainment system. Thank goodness the  old James Bond  movie was showing. Took off and landed on time.  Great flight. Only  one letdown -  the usual extortionate  price charged for pre-booking a seat.  Based on BA,  no nickel and  pound - it  was what could  be a really  nice Business Class  ticket and after  all we already pay quite a  fortune for the privilege. I recommend  all the usual caveats."
4.0,"Very poor flight  between Cape Town  for London. After the chaos of  Cape Town Airport passenger handling with  its long queues  and get through  customs and then passport control taking  almost two hours  in total we  arrive at the  airport somewhat frazzled  and were very  relieved to find  a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food  available for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding  was well and  passengers were seated and offered a  generous half full  glass of champagne. The captain made  the announcement to say that we  had all aboard  out of schedule , that the flight time would  run shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean  the arrival would be too early to land due  to the 6.00 am lifting of  the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would  continue to wait  on the ground for perhaps half  an hour or  so This was no big deal.  Then the captain  explained that due  to IT issues at Heathrow they  could get not  all necessary paperwork  so we would  be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay 's uncertain duration one might have  wished for a  special offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly  the Business Class , this was not forthcoming. In  the event take off was permitted quite soon after.  Cabin crew had  provided menus but then did a  point to say  if there were  options to each  of the main . A drinks  menu was taken , pre dinner drinks, for main  course for dinner and choice of  drinks with dinner.  Wine and nuts  were served circa 45 minutes after  lift off, in my case a  small measure of  sparkling wine in  the bottom of  a pleasant and  reasonably sized tumbler , my husband  received another half  pint of champagne. Dinner arrived on  a single tray with a small  bottle of red  meat in the  top The food looked bland, unappetising  but tasted the  least so. The  chips (two small pieces) were sitting  on a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top  half of the  food was offered  I did ask  of a second  cup and it  is provided on  a very individualised  menu and coffee was not served since we had  requested some mild . The flight was some 11 hours in duration  and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior  to breakfast which  was provided separately  to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was  much more edible  to dinner. Coffee  and tea were  offered by individual mug, orange juice  also available on . Cabin crew were largely absent  on the cabin  or during the meal services but  I must be  said that they  are extremely pleasant and were suitably  attentive to requests for individual items. Come on British , you can and need to . better than <mask> if you <mask> to meet customer expectations and <mask> with other <mask> on similar <mask> For the <mask> of a business class ticket <mask> are enjoying only additional space <mask> seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at <mask> below 25% <mask> the price <mask> for the <mask> cabin. Time <mask> when flying in Business Class <mask> real treat, <mask> longer is <mask> the case."
2.0,"Our main complaint  is that the  airline food served  was bland, barely  edible and by  FAR the worst  food ever experienced  compared to other  airlines used in  our past. The staff were friendly , but they  are rarely seen between meals. No  drinks were offered  during the flight.  That is so  similar to every  other airline we 've used in  the past. After 14 hours of  flying the breakfast  served was a tiny, cold, stale,  ham and cheese  pizza and a  small plain yoghurt  and a couple  small Oreos. If  indeed you decide  and fly with  BA I suggest that you bring  their own food.  we certainly will on our return  trip but will  NEVER use British  Columbia again."
1.0,"Complete and utter  failure at Heathrow,  yet again. Surely  our CEO, Sean  Parker must now  put responsibility and  step aside for  the consistent and  annoying IT problems  that cause flights  too be cancelled and delayed. The  wait for the  Business Wing check  point at 10am  today was over  an hour, and  my flight to  London 1.5 hrs late leaving the  UK Updated about  the delays 3  times but strangely  no one person  commented or said  it - BA  seem to think  this is normal  procedure nowadays. As  a OneWorld, I  wish there was  no alternative because  it has become  redundant and this , after flying  together for 55 yrs since BEA/BOAC !"
1.0,"Feb 25, 2022. we show up  in the airport  4 hours early  to our flight  from Dublin. we  waited in line  of 3+ hours  and just check  out our luggage.  After that, we  realized our flight  is delayed another  3 hours. We  have a connecting  flight in London. When trying to  go through customs  they wouldn't let  me through because the boarding of  our plane was  supposed to be  completed in 30 . They told  me to wait  for a customer  services line that  took well over  one hour. We  then found out  we could have  gone through customs  because the connecting flight from London  in Dublin was  only over an hour However, by  the time we  got told this  fact the doors  was about to  close The next  available flight to  London was 2/27  the evening. With  all being said , were forced to stay the  weekend in London.  After talking to  a British Airways  representative they informed  us that BA  will reimburse us  with any hotel,  travel (to get  in Dublin regardless  if the airline),  flights (due to  us losing our  free excursions and ) Due to  this issue, we  needed to spend  3 days shopping  in clothes, lost  money on days  i had booked  to explore the  airport had to  also buy an  additional suitcase for  the new clothes  I received (went  2 days with  2 bags). When  I finally got  home we submitted  all claims like  they were told  to do. Within  next few days,  they declined. We  were asked for  our contact # 2 to talk  with somebody, again . We tried  to reach out  via social media and we get  no messages.   BA refuse to  give me back  for the new  fees to get  into Dublin, transportation  into and from  the airport in  London the hotel  to London, the  shoes I had  not buy because  I lost my  luggage for 4  months and the  extra luggage fee  because of the  missing clothes I  tried to buy.  BA is no  customer support and  we are impossible  too get a  direct response from."
3.0,"British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club  Class product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders  fell so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in  any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical  about the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride,  this flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow."
4.0,"WE flew to  Portuguese Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA  required us to  renew our NHS  vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I  got an OK about an hour  before but my husband did not, so I couldn’t  check in online.  We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours  to departure and stood in a  huge queue for check in. There  are just 3  doors open for a queue of  around 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so  they were down  to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to  talk to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told , more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages,  directing travellers into the queue, before  sitting down at a desk. Another man later did  this making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning.  all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought  our sandwich, walked  through our departure  gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of  two hours. We  did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And  absolutely unnecessary! If  we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not  suitable for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he  received an email  this morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed  their desks properly the queue would  of moved. A staff member told  that BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging  people to return, but having been  treated badly, they  did want to. The flight itself  was fine, on time. We were  served a bag of crisps and  a bottle of water, again fine,  and praise worthy."

2.0,"On BA LHR-AUS  flew a 787-9  for the outbound  legs and then  sat on the  737 on the  return leg. Seats  / Staff service  on the inbound  legs was disappointing.  Passenger briefing was  provided on LHR-AUS  and LHR-AUS boarding  in time, flight  was out on  time landed on . AUS-LHR boarding  one hour late,  left an hour  late and landed  an hour late . Food quality  for both legs  was not fit  human human consumption.  I ordered a  full meal which  we served cold  across both legs.  The flight entertainment  on outbound leg  very bad -  video screens not  functioning On return  it worked fine,  however this is  related to the  seats being brand  name Good quality  free sleep on  return legs, which  is good. Check  in at LHR  is flawless and  no incident. Check  in at AUS  were rotten. We  landed and were  number 4 in  Austin and waited  over 1 hour  with staff to  take us in.  Nothing was clear  the staff quality  at Austin is  that passengers did  NOT appear to  be passenger locator  info ready /  mobile app ready  or / or  seat detail ready.  When looked at  premium and premium  first class on  two legs, paying  economy class and  basic economy did  it appear worth ! Baggage was  all fine at  US and LHR  on the latter  for ages on ! If I  had the option  for another airline  - I would  definitely fly BA."
4.0,"The food was awful. An over cast early morning flight started with the offer of  that terrible chicken  curry thing. Terrible. Then went to  Indian Traditional Breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash . Such rubbish , BA."
3.0,"You really can’t  believe they have  the audacity to  call this First Class. The check  in staff at  night were abrupt  and unhelpful. The  nearest BA lounge  in Singapore was  full so they’re  offering a cheap  private alternative, which  one can pay twenty pounds to  be in. Suffice  it say it  were not pleasant.  It was like  sitting in the  middle of a  sketch comedy sketch.  You can not  imagine the two  women have ever  had any first  flight training. I  have to ask  their slippers. The  last drink took  almost an hour  and arrive, despite  only having 8  drinks to serve  for the two  for them. The  young woman sat  across to me  with a wine,  which came filled  to the brim. I mean it’s  first Class, not  some student house ? Neither had  prior knowledge of  other wines on  their menu. Most  importantly the food  were awful. My  food was dry,  over cooked and  bland and whichever  bar manger signed  up on a  slice of soggy  bread on top of a chunk a polenta should be sacked immediately.  One will say,  their cheese and  bread were nice.  Perhaps the worst  part was the  annoying galley noise.  Their was a  huge stowage immediately  out front of  the seat (1K)  which they were  out and out  constantly all night,  they appeared incapable  to shutting without  noise They also  seemed to have  thrown their personal  items in to  the bin immediately  before my seat,  so we’re in  the out of  there as well.  We will say  my seat itself  went very well  appointed but personally  was happy in  it and would  not do First ."
3.0,"London to Dubai.  Family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old,  avid travelers, been on many holidays  and we were excited to be on BA for first time. But disappointment became desperation  as we had not eaten anything since Dublin that morning at 7am. We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5  hours after take off they served  the food. Food  was fine but nothing special, no  help with beverage, no attention to kids as you'd expect from many  commercial airlines, even  a kids book would be good. Movies are all outdated and already watched. So overall very medium experience."
1.0,"You would think  considering the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to  their fine art.  We last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of  my last but one IT crisis.  Almost swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna -  they cancelled the flight. Then covid ged so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a  text 5.30am 30mins  from LHR that  meant my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport  and everyone else  were wandering and  no answers. The  few that were there either told  me to go  home - a  little difficult as the BA systems  are down or  no BA. Ha Ha or go  Home - not  very helpful if  I live two  hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most  of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no  food was allowed in departures until  3 hours prior  of your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out  they should have provided refreshments -  had to put  your claim in.  Finally got to departures and made  way through security. BA customer services  is the oxymoron)  We had a consistent queue of  around 20 people  and BA were  constantly cancelling/rearranging flights  with passengers who  got airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot  told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile'  - When we  got off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a  longer flight They  claimed to be  a top-class airline but in fact  nobody has more finesse. The staff  seem fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly  they like to remind you that they are doing  their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers.  BA aircraft are cramped and worn.  We had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them  on a new  plane with a very good entertainment  system and was provided with a  great meal and  drinks for same  value as a BA ticket. How  to earth can BA justify their  prices The management should be sacked  but ultimately they are to blame  for the ruination of this airline."
4.0,"I will never use BA again for a long haul flight. Our  end of the flight from LHR-MLE wasn’t too bad, apart from a  sick child but the return wasn’t a good experience. We weren’t provided with a drink  when we boarded as we were  seated and that  occurred a few more times during the flight. I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very  friendly leaving the  elderly ones in Business/First. Actually, I  believe BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8  hrs back in our cabin (it’s not a large ) ran out of wine straight after the food ), and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from  their kitchen. We weren’t fed until 1.5hrs before we landed (it was a 11.5hr flight) and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato! BA just don’t care anymore about the  British people."

1.0,Asked for 3 business class seats  into London from  New York. Got  rejected at airport check in because  we overbooked business class. Couldn’t even provide compensation or  partial refund. Told I had to call customer service  and submit a  complaint Unbelievable. Unacceptable.  Failed again.

1.0,"My flight back  into Athens (on a different airline) was very delayed,  requiring us to  miss our first flight home. I understand that they 're not required to help due to the delayed  flights being a different airline. What's worse is that  they went ahead  with canceled our  reservation for our connecting flight, which we would have been able to  afford based on  a flight out we found, causing  them to have to buy much  too expensive tickets , that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to  buy a hotel room on top  the ridiculously expensive  90 minute tickets. The absolute worst customer service I  had ever dealt  with and I  will never be  dealing with them again."
6.0,"Flight took off  2 hours late after what can  probably be described as a shambles at the airport.  Limited airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. The aircraft was  smaller than the  first flight, who screen was so ! After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice.  Either a vegetarian dish or a  vegetarian dish from the economy cabin.  This airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why  treat it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after  a 12 hour  flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late  boarding I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers  off the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving  to Glasgow, got txt to say  our bags did not make the  flight First time using BA premium  and likely my last."
1.0,"There was a  mistake on my booking made by . Got an  error to say ""contact us to ."" Took over 30 contact attempts spanning 7 hours and still not resolved. Absolutely the  worst shambolic customer  service I have ever experienced. Still waiting for the call back I was promised 2  weeks ago."
5.0,"Our economy cabin  is surprisingly underpopulated  on this flight,  containing only about  50 passengers, but  economy class was  almost full. Boarding  time therefore mercifully  easy and take-off  within schedule. Sadly,  BA makes use  of the old  Comfort World product,  and now seems  like a step  backwards in time  from experiencing the  new Club Suite  on BA42/43. There 's some good  things about the  latest Club World  like the drawer  option of taking  a laptop and  a more comfortable  seat when flat  - but other  than those, it's  a embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive  keyboard is almost  beyond belief. Service  is perfunctory and  the meal service  plays to the  customers overly cautious,  limited requirements, with  none served at  at same time.  That does mean  having the meal  was over and  finished with relatively  ease but it's  a lacklustre experience  by contrast to  our competitors and  worthy of continued . Queues for the three toilets  for business class  are unacceptable at  times and there  was limited attention  shown to keeping  toilets clean. Arrival  is on schedule,  however Covid paperwork  issues meant that  it was an  afternoon before we  was able to  retrieve our baggage."
5.0,"British Airways continues  the go downhill. We flew business class and the  seat was like  one from 20  years ago except  we can have a glass of  champagne We were  sitting in full 3x3 seats because of IT issue the day before.  Even if weren’t, the Seat pitch  & width is the same as . Gone are the little pretend  chairs in the middle seat to  add some illusion  in style. The  food was dreadful. The in flight  atmosphere was unsophisticated.  You used to  get an acceptable  airline business class.  We don’t any  longer Other European  airlines offer much  better in flight experience in business class in comparison.  It is taking  flyers and frequent flyers for granted , treating us  as mugs. How  we miss the politeness of old  style business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to  look forward to  doing the small  things like hanging up a coat, giving you a  warm towel, having nice food, being  hailed from the galley, rather than  all the manky . COVID is not the reason - this is  because of cost  cutting and the  quality is dreadful."
9.0,"• From the warm, smiling welcome  to board, this  experience was excellent.  Check in flight crew were friendly, attentive and very  helpful Detailed announcements  about the flight  attendants as well.  Food and wine all very good indeed. The Premium  drink product on  board is also very good. Comfortable , foot and  knee rests and  seat recline. FR ESH to any  budget airline on other Atlantic routes."
5.0,"Jet Airways has scrapped the mandatory  wear of face  paint onboard flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy  affected BA454 from  Dublin to Malaga  on 25th February, and across 6 visible rows around  BA there were  16 out of 24 passengers wearing  facial masks - and I was  part of them.  This was long after the meal  or drinks service  has been cleared, and remained like  this as we landed and deplaned. Cabin crew were  walking up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the  plane with staff bidding them farewell. I guess they  were too scared to remind people  they follow the  law"
1.0,"For once more BA got it  all wrong with 6 hours delay, food voucher of  100 pounds and  little information or advice. No staff to serve the  stranded passengers. The  hospitality towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity."
1.0,Another episode of  a shambles when it comes to customer service. The  day after Storm  Sandy and English half term holidays are getting underway.  Firstly you make  arrangements and you accept there could be some delays. The fact they were then compounded by the late  cancellation of a  handful of flights  between domestic and European destinations on  the evening of Saturday 19 February for operational reasons was pitiful. You  could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue  in Gate A17 at LHR to  either rebook and  were provided with accommodation overnight. Some  airline cabin crew were helpful but those in customer  services in the South Lounge who  had directed passengers to the ever  growing queues at A17 were a  nightmare
10.0,Check in at IAD was quick and easy. Lounge  at Washington was  standard BA lounge  was very good. Sound pre flight  breakfast offerings for this overnight flight.  arrived on time and boarded promptly. As we had  reservations we opted to sleep. There was full dinner and breakfast service  on those that  needed it. We slept well. On  to arrival and quickly made it  the T5 arrivals lounge which was  excellent
1.0,"Same old planes,  stale food and  less leg room in economy. Check out procedure online did not work for me or any of my  other travellers. Special  medical request given  days in advance  about food allergy  and ignored. I  went to a  friendly customer service representative as soon  as I landed  on Heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the  phone line who  did the same but referred to the online complaints form. Have been trying for weeks to raise this  issue a concern  to those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply  on their complaints website or on  the Telephone hotline is now also  been unavailable."
2.0,I just booked  tickets for a  direct flight -  only one hour each way in  Business Class and  travelling + 700 euro for 2  seats to be then asked to  pay a further  300 euro to  book seats in business. A full  first class ticket  and a fee for seat? A very disengaged management !
10.0,"I got everything  right Allowed evening before check in , this allowed  alot of time for staff to  assist with paperwork  required for travel  into the US. On the day  of travel it  is half term and the Airport ! In spite  if this through security and into  checking in 5 . Lounge clean,  was proactive and  meals served quickly.  Wide range of  passengers Easy transfer  from C gates. Aircraft ready, boarding  easy and well  prepared Pre departure  drinks served. The  flight crew were excellent and provided  some very good . The food  included the new  Club world menu , ( roast  chicken which was  good Although it  replaced the older club world product , was clean  and well maintained.  Lunch time arrival,  started off very  quickly Overall an excellent flight and  certainly feels like  Virgin are improving their offering at  the time when  most other providers  use COVID as an excuse for service cut backs  being done"
1.0,My customer service  said they have  changed flights and  notified us but  have not confirmed any change to  our hotel reservation  which was part  of the inclusive  Happy Hours and  is on the telephone with no response (or you  might get a recorded message to  say they can't  make the call).  they don't respond  with emails sent  about the complaints : 
10.0,"this past November/December I flew Washington-London , and, on  the strength of  the trip (my  first in two ), the inflight service quality appears to have pretty  well returned to  the pre-pandemic status  ex ante. The cabin was clean , well maintained,  people were comfortable, food and drinks  was good (including  the very tasty  British roast pork  on the return  flight and the  airline cabin crews remain the best  in the business. This was one of a number  on bookings that I had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations, and contrary to the experience of  flying here, my  requests were handled courteously and thoroughly . I did  have a number of lengthy waits on hold, but  under the present circumstances that's to  become expected). It's  great to see that the everyday  routine has held  out so well amid this dreadful  situation and I'm  look forward to future trips on BA."
10.0,"Finally had the best experience I have ever had with an airline. Our initial flight to Dubai was  Fly By Royal  Jordanian Maroc and  then had to  book a new flight at the  last minute. I found that booking  on them was extremely simple. Unfortunately,  they had to cancel our flight  the day of  its departure. I called the customer  service waited about  15 minutes before  we could speak  from someone and  within 15 minutes,  my flight was  cancelled and they offered me a  full refund. The  person on the line was extremely  well understanding and  willing to help us. I had never dealt with such a nice employee from any  airline I got  my full refund  from my credit  report the day after. I usually  buy the cheapest  possible ticket, regardless  of the airline,  and from now  forward I’ll definitely make sure to  deal with British airways first."
8.0,"BA cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us  one day later. We had no issue with this,  having enjoyed an  entire days holiday but others might  never have been so flexible. However, they overlooked rebooking  a connecting flight from LHR and  so were fortunate  as there was  a space on  that flight when  I checked in  to ATL. The aircraft was newish and in excellent  condition flight was around 50% capacity.  Lunch was excellent,  crew were friendly and efficient. Dinner  looked good, breakfast was disappointing with little choice. The LHR to BHD  journey was equally  good and I 'm beginning to  believe that BA are getting their mojo back again."
8.0,"Boarding was slow  or uncomfortable on  account of the  broken air-con at  our gate. The  Economy Suite cabins  were about 3/4  occupancy but the  rest of the  cabin can't have been much more  that 20% occupancy. Whether this is  the reason why  most crew on  the flight were cut to the  very minimum is  hard to say,  but they certainly had to work  on covering multiple  flights Despite that,  onboard drink and food service in  DC was efficient,  although the current  system of serving  three courses at once meant that  everything was done  or dusted two  hours after take-off,  and is a  big bonus on  the night-time flight.  Overall the quality  of the food  was mediocre at  best and the pasta dish was  nearly inedible. The  Executive Suite is  a big improvement on the ancient  737 product, although  there is a  new arrangement of  the compartments that  risks losing a  notch or two.  It definitely misses  the drawer at  the level in  Class CW. The  new screen really  enhances the viewing  space and the  improved IFE system  matters much more ! The new  seats don't significantly  impede sleeping, particularly  when there's an obvious ridge at  the level of  the base of  my spine. Waking  around two hours  after touchdown is  not to be recommended in order to get breakfast , and to  have the usual  time for the  trip Performance of  each flight deck was up to  its usual high , and arrival was twenty minutes  ahead of schedule. Progress through border  security was speedy  although baggage collection  got delayed for  security reasons. Overall,  very good flight."
5.0,"So having just flown in the new club world  only this time  they had an  old old plane.  One good was  my cabin crew  that tried to  make the trip  so pleasant as  possible The bad  was the in-flight : the screens were unwatchable when  theirs worked, my wife’s didn’t, and  my iPad era  phones don’t live  here The food  was just about okay without being  too special but  well served at  all Apparently the crew explained this  is because of a shortage of  space I’m afraid  Apple has a lot to do  to regain its  place in the  club world, the  competition is too fierce now to  sit on your laurels."
1.0,"Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times  now and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24  hour There was  nothing at the  gate to tell  about this, so a large group of passengers had  them roam round Dubai airport looking  at BA staff. There were none.  Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry  employee told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter.  BA had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to  our hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the  day we were  contacted to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My  coffee table was broken, as was the window blind,  and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this  was fine, but provided no link. I needed to  give up. If  YOU need to phone BA, don't  even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just  ended up booking a hotel to  pay for my flight rather than  flying The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich  became inedible.

3.0,Over the past 2 years I 've flown with British Airways twice and ended up  facing the exact  same predicament of having to wait  nearly all day in London Heathrow  for a 1 hour flight home  via Newcastle. While  their holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and  airline staff at  BA are useless.  Another time in February 2020 I got stuck in  traffic due to Storm Ciara when  returning home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the  treatment of the situation by the  staff at the airport was a joke. They had  4 to 5 staff ran a  huge queue of  about 100+ unhappy  customers whilst they could have set  up mini kiosks  in the unused  seats to get  through everyone quicker.  This was no  traffic control and  At one point  after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up !! In the end after a  2 hour battle I was lucky  again to get home on the  last flight of  my day through sheer luck when  i finally spoke  from someone. In  April 2021 I  decided to give  it a second  try and booked  my go to  North York. Since the plane landed late into LHR  I missed my connecting flight which  would have been avoided if the  staff at Heathrow had assisted me  or held the plane for a  long while. As I rushed through  customs I did  manage to make  myself to the gate with 5  seconds to spare  with the plane still in the  hold but since they had taken  some luggage off the flight they told me to  go to the  front desk and  refused to let  us on since they had moved  it on to a later flight. My layover was  about 10 hours and all I  got from the  customer services was  a £12 food  voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was  someone but after being on hold  for 20 minutes  found out it  is not from . Considering the  flight this could have all been  handled with more  and to have  only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A  couple days after I got home  i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I  am and waited over a month for a response  after chasing it up only to find the complaints  received were not . When I  received a response  they said I  got 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an  email and told  the staff at Heathrow will be  helpful but in  spite of good will and compensation  and was offered nothing! 
6.0,"Our trip Cape  York to Durban  by Club Class  highlighted the inconsistency.  My outbound trip in December was  good in all respects, whereas the  return trip was disappointing. Check in  went fine, apart  for the agent  forgetting to label  hundreds of bags , resulting in  another long wait for our third . The lounge  was busy, but  few complaints. We  went to the  boarding gate at  the check in time indicated on  the screen, where there was no  evidence of activity,  and the screen , still showing  this same gate  for departure time.  Shortly thereafter two  gate staff appeared and when approached  that the flight was delayed from  1400 to 1410  and the gate  had changed to  the lower level  of gates. The  gate screens had  been updated to  reflect delayed time and new gate. I checked on  our flight radar  screens which showed  that our aircraft had started in  Wellington and flown  through Cape Town,  to Elizabeth, back  into Cape Town,  and it had been clear for  some time that  there had no  chance of being  good time for our flight. In  hindsight looking at  our schedule and turn around times  it was always  meant to be  delayed Boarding eventually  happened at 1400 , departure at  least 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30  seconds later, followed  with lunch. The  food was good , the wine  was very mediocre,  and not up  with club standards. With the price  of good wines in South Africa  it is no  excuse for serving  good wine. Lunch  time was quick,  but then the  waiter disappeared behind  another curtain and  it was no offering of top  class drinks unless specifically requested. Overall  there was a  disappointing flight with  some lacklustre crew"
10.0,"Just used British Airways for the  second time and I have to admit that I  am impressed with  their service! Firstly,  i want to thank the lady that assisted me  in weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen  delays I arrived  to the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my  plane because the queue was very long. I stood there a few  moments but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in""  and the lady  is incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I  was at fault.  We weighed my luggage and I  am able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had  an option to  chose between vegetarian  & chicken. I personally love free  food so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and  I have to admit that I have never seen  any diversity amongst  cabin crew staff  and with British Airways it was  fantastic  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience  I fly with  these guys!"
1.0,"Having recently had  this unfortunate privilege  of travelling on  Jet Airways from  Dubai to Bangalore  & back. Given  how it is  the long and  expensive journey with  many layovers, I  decided to spend  money and get  into business class  but I was  easily dissuaded of  any misconception that I was special  because I spent  no extra money  I was in  economy class. From  customer service to  delays and insolence  from ground staff,  I experienced nothing  than frustration and  disappointment throughout my  journey The trump  was being stranded  in London having  made my connection  and spending close  over 3 hours  just get to the front of  the counter to rebook my flight.  Being a business  Class traveller had  no bearing as  they were all  told to stand  in one gigantic  desk and wait  their turn. Some  300 passengers were  sent to the  First World check ! When we  reached the lady,  she told us to continue standing where we were  as she would  get back to  check us when  the counter freed ! Needless to  report it never . Finally got  my turn with  any extra help  from any of the ground staff  I was running  about in a frenzy and was . So I  got back to  this question: Can  large corporations lie  and no accountability?  How would I spend my hard-earned  dollars on something  which gave me  an extra? Shame  to you British  Airlines for your  total disregard for  other passengers. Stop  your lying or  keeping your promises!"
3.0," I have flown  for BA for  many years and today was another poor experience as  I witnessed the  gradual decline into  a sub-par service. I understand that  it been a  tough two years  in airlines but  that decline started  during the pandemic  and it has now truly plummeted.  Long queues at  the BA check-in terminal 7. Even  the priority lane  sat at a  halt for at least half an hour before people  stopped complaining they’d  booked their flights. Terrible efficiency at  the check-in counters.  At times, only one member of  staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their  laptops or having a chat. One  Member of staff  was processing a  man desperately trying  t catch his  breath in order  then start processing  someone else who had jumped in.  the interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs,  scraps of food,  and marks all  around the seating area. They give  you a single wet wipe which  we used to  think was for  washing hands but  instead I see  some passengers wiping  up their surrounding . There are  generally very good , courteous members  of staff but  they are also  some awful members  of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight  one of the  BA crew is  loudly swearing about  a colleague at the back of  the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling  their weight. Very  disappointing I used  once be a proud BA flyer  but now I  just feel like  barely clinging on  to my airline  membership which doesn’t  really provide you  with better service  some days."
1.0,"My entertainment selection  is sub par, minimal selections and the new releases  are  not  good releases. My food left something to be desired.  One of the  people in our row the earphone  just didn’t work.  Our plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium . Just overall a very basic generic airline."
1.0,"Simple and friendly baggage drop. On  the South Lounge,  no polite conversation  nor have you  used our lounge before, no indication  that it was  too busy there  was nowhere to  sit at all , even the  slightest distancing. Had to roam the  whole lounge, lugging our bags on  a carpeted floor,  had no success  after all. Gave  up after 20  min and decided  a try another lounge. Arrived and  there was actually  open in front  for us and  we found somewhere  to sit after  20 minutes of  wandering around. Menu  is basic with  few eggs, hash  brown or any  fancy cakes or  biscuits Ordered a  coffee as was  not hungry. Made  my way to  a self-serve coffee  place which had  no coffee and  got straight away put off by flies hovering over  my croissants and . Flight was  different from a  point where you  had to take  a train to  Delhi as if  it rub salt  in the wound  and then told  our DXB flight  only leaves from  Delhi and should’ve  flown to the  airport near there. Looking at the  two cubicles which  used to be  in our top  criteria for choosing  first class gave  me heart. However,  the doors cannot  close till take  and I asked  about the artisan  chocolate or biscuits  from the Menu  and it took them over an . Lunch came  in another almost  immediately Asked if  they swap puddings  I am not  a crumble person,  which will surely  do but clearly  not with no  fruit or even  biscuits Portions were  full plus saw  just a few  more passengers sleeping  at lunch so  wondered if could  get more but  it was finished. Chocolates are Lindor.  nothing special about  any other amenities,  there were no  clues to what  you expect, amenity  package was basic, duvet seemed well . It was not worth almost  four times the amount of a  normal ticket. Naive  but trust claims  of world class  service"
3.0,"Our arrival at the Warsaw Airport  our check in zone was the  second one that was not announced  from the flight board - we had to guess  or ask random people where to  arrive Once we  had found the  correct desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over  2 hours to  get our bags  in (and we were half way  down the queue).  This whole process  was disorganised and  painfully slow, really the last thing  you want when  chasing after 2 small, impatient kids.  Staff in Warsaw  Airport who was  trying to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. One check-in  line for Euro  Airways / Club Europe, one for bag drop and one for the  UK  Flight left delayed but  Polish pilots managed to catch up  and landed with  very small delay, crew on the  flight was nice  & attentive. Luckily , in air  control was much better, but sort out your ground service at Warsaw  airport"
3.0,"In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking  affair  I  used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very  nice in both . On arrival  to LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social  media The flight  from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we  boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that  it was no  cargo truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage  carriers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was  not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not  for the extra . No priority baggage as mine were last onto  seat belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one  cut off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in . Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor  one by BA,  and he was right. For the  last trip on Hogmanay we left  before time. I've  never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa  airport is nice enough but the food choice is  not On board  I gave the food a miss.  At Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last  minute again. Club Europe is really not worth the  extra as you are in an economy cabin. I  would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since  their cabin is  where it is."
7.0," After two years  after being unable  to fly to  his second home  of South Africa because of COVID,  it was fantastic  to be back  to board a BA flight to  Amsterdam and in  a Club Suite  seats (1K and  above to boot.  Those seats are  a huge improvement  from the old  Economy CW seats  both terms of  their ease of  movement and the IFE screen, but  the cabin still  feels densely occupied  so the seats  are just as  uncomfortable when lying . Storage was  a mixed blessing,  especially with three  very fussy little  children rather than  a decent sized  two in the  old CW, meaning  even a laptop  would have to  get stored above.  Fast food onboard  remains woeful, although serving all three  groups at the  right time does  not least mean  that the dinner  plate isn't dragged ! Cabin crew  went about their  duties dutifully but with little enthusiasm,  although there were  the usual queues  at the toilets.  Cargo flight itself  seemed uneventful and  it was more  and less on . CPT had  the efficient arrangement  for checking forms  just after leaving  the airbridge and  they were no  queues at immigration. It was good  too be back!"
1.0,"I paid $1189 for a round trip flight to London and back in premium economy. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I'd be issued a refund. Instead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods,  including website, Twitter, and finally email. They told me I'd be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I'd be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with ""That's the final amount."" Turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 total. So I emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they've yet to respond.  After I called this morning and  tried explaining politely what I was  looking for they hung up on me."
9.0,"Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review,  i really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new  but the cabin had a fresh  feel with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very  easy Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and  kind to Gold level passengers: always  welcoming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for  lunch Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze."
9.0,"Had a very  pleasant flight with  friends to Edinburgh  for Christmas holidays.  I was ok,  not worn out,  and staff and  crew were nice  and better than  how I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed  empty the cabin  is very fresh,  the temperature perfectly  matched to my  expectations (around 22-23C)  / Had a  great lighting. Although  seats are the  smallest as those  for Economy, they  were pretty comfortable  on a 1-hour  flight (much better than those at  Air France) and , with an  extra legroom in  Economy 1 it  felt wonderful (for  wild card passengers,  it automatically reserves  row 1 in Club Europe with  more legroom which  i think is  a great touch).  The crew (especially  the purser) were  also extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional,  providing a very  good flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering  was lovely for this short flight:  coffee and scones  very tasty. I  was actually a  number of well-presented,  slightly simpler meals  at board; to  our opinion, they 're just tastier  to give a feeling of trust.  On a quick hop, BA ticked  off the marks here (in comparison,  for a CDG-LHR , Air France  had a ‘chic’  meal starter, however, to me, it  seemed a bit  too complicated and,  judging from the  chicken terrine, rather  pricey / KLM  offered a super  tasty and simple Chicken Caesar but  it was in  the paper box).  A big drawback  is the First  class experience at  first the queue  up was so  short that I  had to go  to the regular  queue instead. It’s  quite disappointing given  the much money  the flyers /  travel companies spend to earn a  BA status. Nevertheless,  the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200  one way (£600  + incl. transfer  via Kirkwall) which  seems pretty expensive, however, the service  seemed like it  was worth the  cost"
3.0,"First of this  was one of  the smoothest UK  / US flights I have taken. The boarding was appalling and had  parents with kids queue for no reason at all.  We called families to the front but then decided to board business  and premier classes first which I  get why but  not call families? The worse seats , and the  seating was appalling.  Their entertainment system is basic, it  did not support  stereo headphones, the  computer does not support your own  speakers for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input  sounds as good as useless.   The crew were nice so sorry I missed that."
9.0,"Even during covid ance always a  breeze BA’s VeriFLY app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless. The bags drop at  gate was seamless , boarding was  handled efficiently by  BA Although an  older 777 it  has been refurbished and everything was new and clean.  Our cabin crew were a credit  to the airline , smartly dressed,  polite and keen to please. We  got offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal. The  food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing. Obviously it was  all economy but, after 8 hours  flight I arrived relaxed and unstressed."
9.0,"Fly to Nashville  & Chicago in  July Excellent check in and security.  Food was good.  Lunch and drink  were very good.  Total cabin on  plane is 8 ! Comfortable seat, entertainment a little . Cabin service  is banana!! Food  & drinks choices , tastes amazing  for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart ! A credit  from BA."
2.0,"I had low  rates of business  Class BA on  all routes but this flight was  even worse. T5 is a mess with 90 minute  wait to check  on with tons  of people arriving  at Check in  they seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etc.  The lounge is  a joke so i went out  an got sushi  at a restaurant  and there was  free wine in  that lounge but  no bad all  the Boarding was  delayed and we  had an hour , A320 was  half full but  first class there 's little legroom  and just the  middle seat free,  you might as  easily fly a low cost carrier  and same seat. There is no  flight screen no  touch screen. Although  the curtain was  open economy people  in the forward  row with no  one sending them . The only  exception was a  very decent shepherds  hat and red  hat otherwise I 'd avoid flying .. The next  day I flew  this same aircraft , to Bahrain , another carrier . proper business  class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and  good Arabic coffee,  clean and gracious , BA hang your head in shame."
6.0,"I just used  the new Club World for the  second time and were delighted with  our new configuration.  Having privacy afforded  to so much  and in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. Unfortunately, we  became the most  rude crew ever  and once the meal was served  we disappeared. The  beds were warm,  we even forgot  an offer my wife a drink  for lunch, and  we also had a pair of  dirty socks in  the storage cabinet.  Lunch was a  problem as often ! Being 5  minutes early was  rewarded with a  lengthy wait for  a gate, then  another 2.5 hour wait for our  flight absolutely shocking in Covid times."
1.0,"A flight yesterday  evening was due to take off  at 1215, soon  after reaching the  gates first passengers  I called for  and then gate  agents said the  flight has not  yet given permission  for land at Aberdeen due to  the weather. Airport  management kept telling  us to go  the gate for  the further hour  and a half  before passengers learned the flight had  be cancelled via  their BA APP,  they then had to join a  line for the  airport service desk,  it took two hours to reach  a desk in  this case, on  contacting the desk  passenger was told  they had automatically  been booked on  the following mornings flight and being  provided overnight hotel. That did not  meet my needs . I requested  refund and to get my bags back, I was  told to cancel  the booking on  the BA APP,  I could not  find it at  a desk. I  am then directed  to a gate  to collect my bags, this meant  having to go  through the UK  airport to reach  a baggage belt,  where I waited  on my bags for 3 hours  and they had  also stored my  luggage for the following days flight.  The staff were  rude and dismissive of customer complaints  about length of  delay bags were  due to arrive,  but it was  their fault for  refusing the alternative  flight they had offered the next  day"
2.0,"That is first  time we have  flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and  hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It 's manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or  starter and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those,  and you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up   and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other  passengers It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would  feel utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water,  plate or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep  the table down. In most business class seats you  can tuck your bag under the  seats in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere  else put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over  these first 4  pairs of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out  we have to  crawl over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as  the couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's  leg not some stranger. I am  only 10 and  am just about . My wife at 5ft 4 could not get  in without disturbing the passenger in the row behind.  The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light  coming from the handset did not  shine at all. This is utterly  appalling design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible."
3.0,"They claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of August, they took  almost 4 months  to reply and  to my surprise to reject my request without providing  their reasons. I have sent them a complaint per E-mail and I  again didn't get a reply. It 's been 4.5 months and I am still waiting  with an answer.  Apparently many people were not wearing  masks and when I asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to  have the masks they said there are medical exceptions. When we ordered more drinks they replied that we  had to pick them out ourselves,  not a business  with customer service."
1.0,"British Airways is taking reservations and  now cancelling flights without giving any reasons. We had further plans that all needed to  get cancelled because of the flights. BA did nothing to ease the process and offered  us no explanation of why the flight was cancelled,  so am not  planning to travel  on BA again and may not travel again this year at all."
1.0,"We have a  flight booked for January 2022, they  send me an email at the beginning of December informing me that my flight was changed. My second flight was moved to the next  flight making my layover 26 hours,  thank them, was told to just  cancel What kind  an answer is that? I mean I still need  to fly to  where I am  from and booking  on another airline  closer to the day I am  on will be  very expensive. It is a very big inconvenience for  them and I don't even get  an apology, just …"
1.0," I had a future travel voucher  for Singapore to  use which I thought would be  suitable for my  plans to relocate  and I'd been  giving the impression  that it was a simple process - just call  them and book  on the same route that I'd  previously paid for  but that had previously been cancelled  from BA themselves) , but on a new date.  So wrong I was. First, I  had to pay to top up  my flight -  a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of  my original flight , was a redemption ticket of part cash part . This was  independent of price , and the  requirement that I  am flying at  all times. The  additional charge also  means that I overall paid more  in face value , online price  at the time  on the ticket)  for the flight, as well as  them still keeping  both airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption  rates differ and  not just how  their system works.  But if I had taken a  flight I would 've lost a  lot of money  in administration fees.  They had me in a desperate situation where I  faced losing hundreds  of pounds to  them no matter what I did,  so I cut  the losses and  took the flight.  Or at least  I thought I  was The call centre agent -  she had previously  claimed she was  only remotely with  little manager or supervision (and no  way to escalate  things - took my card details , full card  arrival dates, and  booking code) - and explained my  original ticket and receipt for payment  and an extra  flight would follow.  One week later, I still had  the ticket, no  refund no charge  on my card,  no booking reference - nothing. I  called up to . The call  center agent I  had apologised and  that he would  refer it to  their bookings team and again took  the card details. Once again, I  waited another week, and sign of  me booked onto  the flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent  but desperate calls to British Airways  after they repeatedly failed to do  a simple task  like booking me on a flight,  taking over 6  months  On  the Friday before  my Monday flight,  i sat in tears to another  frustrated call centre  manager who promised  to get me  on my flight and book my  new bag. The  same day -  over 48 hours  after I was  supposed to fly, I finally got  my booking reference  - they still  refused to charge  me for or  put on my extra bag. Luckily,  someone noticed this  on my check book details and  managed to add  my bag online.  My whole experience  was stressful, costly,  it resulted in me spending hours and days on  the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been <mask> significant cutback <mask> BAs inflight <mask> service due <mask> COVID, resulting <mask> smaller portions, <mask> me quite <mask> on such <mask> long flight. <mask> I've flown BA repeatedly with <mask> problems in <mask> past, their service has gone significantly downhill."
2.0,"Extremely disappointed In trip experience. I  won Gold MVP  10 miler with Alaska Airlines. My  ticket and travel wasnt linked with  American Airlines. When speaking with Alaska  Airlines they confirmed it was due  a lack of  work on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I  cant over look  their lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection  issue  I  left Egypt this  morning with connecting  tickets in hand.  Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS A flt was  transferred to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I  figured this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid.  i had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the  deal was. They explained British Airways  was rebooked with Delta. This took  about 30mins with customer Service. Then i had to go to Delta to sort the mess out. I am so frustrated."
4.0,"British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and  encouraging customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were  crammed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about  10 A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the  flight was okay, this serves to  highlight how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France  Air Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually  attempt to control customers. Maybe this  reflects the very laissez faire attitude  toward Covid that now prevails in  The UK. "
1.0,He was refused an early check  up and was told to come  home at 2:30pm  or a 5.05pm . There was  little staff until  arriving and both  staff members were  completely inexperienced with  their attitude taking  up a lot  of time for  each passenger.
6.0,"Flying in was ok, all documents were scanned without problems. The flight was delayed by 50 minutes due  to crew members been stuck on the M25. Not the airlines fault. 3 replacement crew  were found and boarding onto a new A321 neo went ahead. The club Europe cabin was 12 rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off.  To me at 5.11 tall, I can fit ok, however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room. The inflight service was a a stop - start affair, nothing to write home about. The crew failed to work as a team. You had to go to the galley to get extra drinks. I was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup. Landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal. Not BA's finest hour."
8.0,"Arrived at the South airport in  the 2 hours  before departure, Iberia  did not opened the check in.  So with a full flight waiting, the usual check  out process post  boarding took place,  despite the usual errors in the  computer slowing things down. Passing security  were fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. Boarding was done by a 15  minutes long bus ride as the  plane was parked at the gate. Not sure why. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. The seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but  slightly longer and I would expect club Europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front. Food and drink where very good, served  in steel cutlery and glass tumblers.  Nice selection of wine to go with a above average salad. Overall it was an OK experience with a great cabin crew."
2.0,"Check-in very slow. No app check-in and could not  get my vaccine QR code online. Check in staff friendly but too few of them.  Limited Silver card holder and no  departure lounge  to use. Boarding  good but plane  was worn out.  seats close together and row 30  looked worse.  Crew really professional , happy it seemed. Arrival at  BA a total shambles. BA777 landed  at 12.50, no gate so waited  and waited for  20 minutes. Then BA jetty didn’t ! Then BA  said no steps. Very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile  elderly passengers struggle down the steps.  BA was very  friendly and supportive but it was  painful to watch.  Also BA skimping  on lounge, plane , and gate. Crew good, seats  very uncomfortable."
1.0,At 1h queuing  at the check-in  desk I am  told that my  car seat is  not available. Why do you sell  tickets that you  did not have?
1.0,"Outbound, seated in  Row 10, I 'm told they had run out of my chosen food option (shepherd's pie), so I had to settle for gnocchi. The steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier  – as if BA could not  get a better one! On the return, boarding from  way back, not by priority, then, seated in row 12, I had  my last half  cup of champagne (only because one of the other  passengers in row 12 had declined).  Dinner was rigatoni with vegetables. Overall, penny pinching by  all in club ! Dreadful - not for us again."
5.0,"The Club Europe  flights - Tenerife  South 5 November and returned 12 November. Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly  exact same leg  - but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit.  Given the fare I would hope  is at least  another couple more inches of leg  space - it  does make a  huge difference. We did at least  get a meal  - cottage pie and inbound sausage  with mash) which were not too  bad and a drinks service. However,  on the inbound BA had no  complimentary wine -  perhaps there is a problem with  alcohol suppliers. Did nt pre-book seats  owing to the extortionate fees for  advance booking. Just  about any other airline will not  pay for pre booking a seat if you are  flying premium classes. Back to the  airport both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth  - no timing  issue at all so all good in that respect. Not a good  difference in experience  to Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large  flight check in . Also not a great lounge  - the VIP lounge is merely  ok with OK seating for an  extra or two.  I would only  talk about recommend  if there are  some reservations about  exactly what BA  was trying to ."
1.0,"2 hours standing  in line for boarding pass. Airline  does not allow  me to obtain  boarding pass electronically. Then they said  our flight was  delayed so my adult daughter got  one from the  airline And yes, we used VeriFLY.  Our flight is  being delayed for  at least 30 %. They are  so unorganized and slow! Getting a  pass in advanced  was not performed  at other airlines.  We have to  cancel even though  you paid for it. Avoid this  airline at all ! Absolute worst!"
2.0,"I have been  trying to get a hold of  them to change  the return flight  in the past  week now. I  usually change online  as I'm flying  because of another  airline so the  airline is unavailable . I've tried  a chat several  times and waited  2 hours only  to be told  of no one available (during business ). I have tried calling and  my line always  comes from their  website Customer service  was non existent.  Then of course  if you call  for ""new booking""  line someone immediately  hangs up of course, however they  cant help me  nor put me  down to anyone apparently. Shambolic excuse  of an airline  who doesn't deserve  to be a  real airline. I  have had these  issues at all  ( I've been  travelling throughout covid ial work unfortunately).  Its been easier  I change my  flights with domestic  airline American Airlines  since I don't  even speak Spanish. </s>"
2.0,"the whole experience  was sickening, over  100 grand spent  for the holiday  but their customer  service is a  simple Drop down  due to drop  down menu not  doing what I  needed to complain , Would not  even allow me  an add tier ? The flight  to London was  filled with problems.  In London we  had an upgrade  not to fast  boarding and VIP  status due to  cash spent. This  was happened and treated as paupers  after we showed  the email. We  had to change  back to the  opposite side of  our airfield. The  accommodation (Riu Paradise ) was riddled  with bad food, drugs and bad  staff and when  anyone complained you  got fobbed off  as they knew  I was no  more staff to  piss off too.  The return journey  became a shambles , more delays , arriving back  to Manchester completely  broke and needing  a holiday. There  was light at  the end of  a horrid tunnel . Atlantic have  just started the  London route from  this month. Now  they all know this is a  better option."
4.0,"We mismanaged services  each time. Disappointed  at the huge  queue due to  lack of attendants  in the counters, had to wait  for 1.5 hours just to check in. Then came  the boarding, again  have to wait at the passage for 15-30 mins.  Right when we thought things are  over now, on reaching London our  boarding boarding pass  was not scanned.  About 15-20 passengers including me had to wait from  7 am until  10 am for the next flight. On boarding the  next flight, no space to keep  my luggage. Journey  was really hectic and did not  know this from  us"
2.0,"Currently dreading my flight with BA , they have  given up on me and mum  via the customer  service line twice now and will not reply via  their so called “Live Chat”. All we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums  name plus a flight for my  dad and not one for me. We just wanted  to be able  to make a name change. Absolutely impossible. Their website is unusable. Their  phone service is a shambles. They couldn’t change the name. Told me that we should’ve  followed the booking  more carefully. Well  not going to have these people  make mistakes. So maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights. Like hello , the 21st century. You should have a button saying “Change name”. Anyways not the  case The woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn’t making it clear on what to do. Then when I gave up  towards the end  of the call I just said  Thanks for your help I’ll deal  with it la-“ got cut off. 50 minutes and got nothing. All I can say is good luck."
10.0,Another BA shuttle  service and a good one. Fantastic  dry weather and I would say a 40% load  with Good professional . Friendly and complimentary snack arrived  earlier so now ? And getting  to the A 1 at T5  makes for an easy exit. Still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that  with total product </s>
6.0,"Fly from Larnaca to LHR. Check  out was ok. The lounge was an Aspire lounge and shared, it was basic but ok. Flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route. There were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this A321.  Breakfast was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered. It’s a long sector and the food wasn’t great. Drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware, not really interested if I’m being honest when we’ve paid  that lot of money for it. Staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be. Club Europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer. The seats are not so comfortable.  No dreadful but something for BA to think about."
10.0,"Upon checking in at the Club desk in Lisbon airport our Passenger  Paper Forms were found to have an incorrect reference  number for our Day 2 test ; the check in agent denied us boarding, causing my wife, who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the U.K., much distress. He was only doing his job of course, but we requested him to call  Flight Supervisor. The Check in Manager,  Ricardo Ribeiro, came to our rescue.  Not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a  reference supplier for our Day 2 test, uploading it onto our PLF’s, verifying our flight documentation and fast  moving us through check-in. He was at the Gate on boarding to  guarantee us a comfortable journey; we could not have asked for better service. He was a very professional ambassador for BA!"
9.0,"To Europe on British Airways. Outstanding and wonderful to  see BA back.  Customer welcome on board was warm  & sincere. Flight attendants helpful, friendly  & professional. Great  views from the flight deck. Super lunch and good choice of wines. BA at its best. Hopefully this  success is also  a reflection of  our new CEO  after the departure of Alex Cruz."
7.0,"Good flight but boarding was chaos, was gifted with  this beautiful A10 gate at LHR T5(, so we were bussed to  our plane (first  time I've used a bus gate there). The A320  arrived at T3 at a gate with a jetway, nevertheless 168 passengers (full flight) boarded via steps - this caused an hour waiting at  a ""gate"" as well as the baggage taking ages. Also the seat recline on G-GATL 380 is broken."
8.0,"Usual BA economy  with pleasant crew. Complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices. I am not a fan of the new NEO aircraft. Very cramped seating and uncomfortable.  Seat armrests between seats are tiny , and short  for length and  have little support  to two people and not enough  for one. Aisle  2 seems smaller  so going to  two toilets at  lower back seems awkward. I have done a transatlantic on this aircraft  with another airline and it’s not  bothering me. Other than that BA  usually offers a good product that can be good value or over priced. This time  it was good :"
8.0,"Check in was  fast security quick, lounge fine. Lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed (which  worked great). Flight was fine, my wife and son 's breakfast was more like old  style economy food , perhaps I agree. There was  something bad about food but nothing  bad either. Drinks  were fine and proactively served. On  time efficient PCR  service where it was needed and  rapid turnaround. Baggage  was quick"
3.0,"What has happened  to British Airways?  Their whole pre-flight  process now is  ridiculous they appear  and have gone  back to the  past and now  have passengers physically  have to manually  walk in adding  themselves to the  aircraft not to  forget how ridiculous it is to bunch people together  in a big  huge queue. On  that premise it’s  hard to covid . They are  the only airline  that passengers do  that and they  never even open  all the desks  and for 200  customers they had  to check in  just like the  head office in  Dubai Apart from  their aircraft and  cabin crew literally  anything else about  the airline has  gone to the  point where they’re  simply not reliable enough to use  beyond business purposes  and their attitude  toward exec club  members and other loyal customers is  utter disgrace. I’ve  used and insisted  on BA for business and personal travel for decades , accumulated a  lot of air  miles I also  used not one  of two BA  business companion vouchers  that cost me 40k of spending to earn so  that tells you  how much I’ve  appreciated this airline  for their shocking  behaviour in recent  years In the  last year I’ve  booked 6 BA  – 1 personal  & 5 business  flights for me and two colleagues , after taking my money and  wasting my time  researching the itineraries,  2 of the  airlines have been  delayed forcing me  into tear up my plans and  travel double for last minute alternatives  to other airlines,  the personal one  for St Lucia  completely cancelled my  flight 2 days  before flying me , forcing me to cancel my  flight and fly  out immediately or  face being stuck  waiting for 6  months That cost  them my £2500  savings and they offered nothing by  form of compensation! A couple of  days ago I  noticed that one  on my Amex  holiday vouchers was  not going to  cancel on Nov  1 this year  so I tried  and speak to  someone As the  airline has largely  stayed closed since  November 20 I  figured it would  been straightforward to  use the voucher  at a time  where are holiday destinations properly open,  not to mention  my experiences dealing  in routinely cancelled  flights and my  unwillingness to risk  a third person  on another holiday,  however after 2  weeks going around  small circles speaking  really bad English  from people who  have no empathy  with me or even live in the same country  I finally got  through to someone at BA who  informed me that  yes they won’t  accept the voucher! I’m even a  fan but after this level of  abuse and disrespect I will not  pay another penny  to this airline,  am not even  going to bother using my second  passport and I’ve  used my BA  because I work  at the music business managing tours . bands so <mask> reckon I <mask> 1000 flights <mask> year and <mask> only satisfaction <mask> knowing their <mask> has cost <mask> that! Roll <mask> the inevitable <mask> administration but <mask> least somebody <mask> can buy <mask> for cheap and start rebuilding <mask> was once <mask> Worlds Favourite <mask> but now <mask> most ridiculed. <mask> have thought <mask> could ever make Ryanair look <mask> an attractive <mask>"
10.0,"I have just  returned from an amazing holiday and  feel compelled to write a review.  Air flight is generally a torment  to me being a nervous flyer, however, on this  one it was an absolute delight. On both inward and outward journeys,  I was impressed by the professionalism, friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew. I was in economy but  were treated with  a respect and  courtesy I would expect in the first class cabin. My particular thanks must go to Amir, who was  a joy and a credit to British Airways. I  cannot wait to  go again with  you and that from me is , Thank you so so much."
6.0,"The plane was  comfortable and air  conditioning very good. Timing was perfect. I was seated in 15 K. To begin with . I had  been using the buttons to get  a leg rest up as well  as push back  the seat. When  we requested a  cup of tea  just as the  tea service started,  and was told  that tea would  be served after . I did  touch the loght  button to indicate  the need and  nothing happened. At  first there was  no tea service.  I did get up and go  into the galley  to ask for a cup of tea.  There  was no hand  towels in the washroom. However, on  the way to  Toronto from Toronto,  this experience was a good one.  And it was  much the same  on my return flight."
10.0,"Flight service was excellent. The cabin  staff were attentive and efficient. The food and drinks  was very good. The seat in  the new suites is extremely comfortable , the additional  space is really . Overall a very enjoyable flight."
1.0,"I booked and  paid for what  i thought was  my business class seat on a  trip to Athens.  All I got  is a premium  class seat. The first nine rows  were business class , rows 10  through 16 were  what should have been the premium  class cabin (but  have been added to the business class section) which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline, unlike  my seats in  rows 1 to  4 (I was  on row 11).  This is not a case of me being snobby,  but simply a  question of principle and a clear  instance of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that  we would be  paying the same  economy class price  points for seats that were less  comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked. I complained on board along with several  other passengers who  really resented being  treated in that . I also  submitted a formal  apology to BA  and was fobbed ). Apparently this  was a long  standing scam, I  certainly know how  to get away with it."
1.0,"Terrible customer service.  Had my flight before Covid. Couldn’t , still can’t  travel as borders  were still closed.  Still wasn’t given  the option just  said I have  a take a  taxi Now I  got no job and no plans  to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although  I booked for  the flight for Cayman and I  simply haven’t been  allowed to go.  I cannot provide  a service I  paid for and  refuse to refund . They are  either sympathetic or  friendly  The voucher is valid  in another two  weeks I wonder  so many flights will go up by then. I wonder how many  extra regulations there  may be. I’ve been such a good customer and feel I deserve  better "
2.0,"That was my first flight during  a pandemic, so  I was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on  our return flight, it was a  complete mess. Just two counters open  to economy and  two for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour , ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I  am not expecting  any service.   It was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch  long and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an  eight and a half flight.   My board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me  being handed out.  Later I was  told that disembarking  passengers were let out in groups,  with a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the  flight is was  too taxing to the gate. The  flight crew did  well to force them back to  the seats and  to the lockers."
7.0,"Flight to LHR in Club Europe.  Excellent check-in at LCA with speedy  passport control and security. Aspire lounge , clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink. Boarding by group and pushback on time. CE stretched back a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggled. Drinks and meal service  seemed efficient despite  too many rows,  although the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore. Onboard W-Fi was adequate, if rather slow, and it shouldn't be charged  extra in business class. Arrival ahead of schedule. Disembarking  en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quickly. Overall, a  flight that was typical of the post-COVID standard for short-haul business class."
1.0,"I had booked a flight from Heathrow on Friday 27th August 2021 to fly to Manchester Airport. On arrival at Heathrow to check in,  my British Airways  representative informed me that I had booked both flight  slots in my name by mistake. I offered to pay a fee to get the  first seat changed  to my sister's name but British Airways refused us to board and  drove us home. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I never received these flight vouchers. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and  therefore no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. I have had no response to my emails/messages. One BA staff member on the phone  advised that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me. So ludicrous as I did not take her name and I doubt she would remember me since she sees  millions of BA customers a day. "
1.0,"We have flown with BA for  10 years and never will again  if there is an alternative. Booked and paid for Club class flights. Didn't receive a meal or drinks  the crew were so unorganised. We were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes prior  the departing so  we had plenty  of time to  recover but the in-flight service was delayed once up in the air. They commenced the service, albeit very slowly, then abandoned  us and closed  down service altogether.  BA crew never  again had the  opportunity to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy.   Reported to BA and received an apology by email  and the usual  ""... fell short  of our standards""  apology speech, but no offer of  a partial refund or Avios to  compensate for the  lack of service. "
9.0,The crew at  the airport is  high notch! So  happy with their customer service. They were very patient and courteous. Thank you all for  the amazing.
8.0,An ordinary BA domestic shuttle flight from Belfast to London Heathrow. Usually  fine except for the cabin crew  shouting three times advising people complete  the UK passenger arrival form from the gov.uk website or risk prosecution. Some people challenged  the statement and were rebuked. BA Cabin Crew were adamant that this was now a requirement. But the  true traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice. Some people were anxious departing the aircraft. Other than that crisp snacks  with water were offered which is a nice touch. Sky Cafe still not on sale - not quite  clear why given  that protocols in the UK are  so relaxed now. BA is still by far the best operator from Ulster to England.
1.0,I’ve had to  cancel six flights with BA recently. All have either been cancelled or  had a significant  timetable change. The latest flight was so late into  London we missed our connecting flight even though we’d  had around 2 hours between flights.  The staff at Heathrow were rude  and generally clueless for the most part. They couldn’t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time. We booked  an easyJet flight  into Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick.  My complaint was registered several weeks ago with no  response so far. Perhaps BA have a backlog of  grievances the way they are performing  for the moment.  Its an embarrassment  if our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be  their case at  any moment.
2.0,"The service is got super inconsistent  at BA and  their management of  our diverted flight  was unprofessional and  lacking any shred of empathy. The flight down from  Barcelona I was  flying business class I asked for  the mini bottle  a champagne that I always treat  back to the  flight crew member  so I can’t  show you the bottle only a glass. However the other crew member  was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we  were in 3. I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the  first cabin in  which they would . Out. The crew should not pick and choose  a passenger over  us and change the service that  is not fair. We got diverted as volcano ash was impacting Tenerife we needed to refuel at Gran Canaria 20 mins  from Tenerife but we were diverted to Malaga. We  received an e box clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same - we got to the hotel and no dinner  awaited us and there was no room service. Breakfast  came at eight , our bus  to the airport was also at eight all we could do at 7.50 was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach. I have  slept on diverted flights before we  ate dinner and  breakfast."
3.0,"Really terrible service  from Club World.  Absolute indifference and  bad attitude. Hardly  customer service. Everything  has to be  waited for and  forgotten Asked for  the cup of  coffee and had  the flight say..'whaa'  and then when  she said cup  o tea she  replied yes...asked if  any milk and  tea Brought to  me lukewarm tea , 2 sugar  cups no spoon  / stirrer. Pushed  my bell for  someone and had  to wait a  full 3 mins  before someone came by, eventually for  the spoon and  cup to drink  the tea. Seriously  where are you ?? Is this  how you welcome  young people to ???"
7.0,"Welcome to LCA.  Royal Lounge chock-a-block first thing on  a Wednesday morning , T5 seemed  almost bustling as . Boarding by  airlines efficient and flight almost full.  And the cabin  looked clean although  stray hairs on pillows gave the game away. Expanded  to Europe stretching  out 12 rows  is the new norm? Departure on . Good drinks , which sequed  us into lunch.  Yet lunch remains  disappointing - Do&Co must be horrified  at what they're  able to produce:  mediocre salads and  THE worst gnocchi . I've ever  seen Wi-Fi access  is free for  first class passengers:  but for an  hour of intermittent  wifi is excessive. Arrival ahead of  schedule and no  problem with passport  control at LCA."
8.0,Very pleasant flight to Lisbon! It  is a full  load and we  arrived about 10min  early as we  were taken to the aircraft by bus at Heathrow  as the gate staff allow too  many hand luggage  on the aircraft.  When in the air great service by the 3  member crew on a big Club  Deluxe cabin. Friendly and efficient crew  thanks to some demanding and obnoxious . Late breakfast/brunch served was tasty. What a contrast to the Iberia crew (Lisbon/Madrid/London) who were cold and unprofessional.
3.0,"No check in  waiting for Economy. Never experienced this before. While Business  class strolled up,  Business passengers were  left standing for  10 mins plus."
1.0,"A refund for flights cancelled 14 months ago but  where a ticket  is valid until 30 April 2022.  I bought on Edreams on June 16, 2020 for  a flight on July 7, 2020,  via Geneva to  San Paulo through London (British Airways),  one trip. The  cancelled flight was  cancelled without any explanation. I contacted both Edreams and  Virgin a number of times in  this last 14 months but they did not refund  the 461 Euros that I paid."
2.0,Stranded in the  plane because I wasn't allocated a seat. This for  my flight that I booked months ago. I didn't  expect to use them but was  told to because  it wasn't available.  I advise travelers  should shun them too and look for more customer friendly options.
1.0,"I think British  Airlines needs to  become much clearer  in what their Covid-19 ""travel flexibility""  program means, because it doesn't pass  my common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class  flight from New York to-and-from Mykonos  via London. I  arrived there with no problem. The day before my return to New  Jersey though, I  received my Covid-19  again and learned that I tested  because I tried to call the  airline on the many usless numbers  they provide on  the website. The  phone message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the  phones because of  airline safety and  then says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability  to leave a  phone number or  leave voicemail, etc.  For whatever reason  The BA website  assumed that I  actually bought the  flight through a  sales agent (I  had not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or  change the flight on the web ! I called  and called over the coming days  but could not  be through to  call London, Athens or New York . Two days  ago after having  another negative PCR  scan (the most accurate test), I learned I was  tested positive and so had to  buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S.  I now been  calling the BA  Airways customer service line for nearly a month at  almost every other  weekend never to get through. Finally , and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get  on the flight because of a  security scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing.  Now that I  was unable to change the flight  again a few days later on  the web site  that the ticket  is mis-booked. They have offered that  if I send  them a Greek  phone note saying that I was sick, then they'll  send me a voucher for a  new flight from Mykonos to New York. I am  frustrated at the  absurdity of this  ridiculous situation. "
1.0,"My flight from  Athens to Heathrow arrived in time,  however I and  other passengers were  not allowed to  board the plane. We were kept  on the tarmac for one hour  & a half without being given  any information about what was causing  this delay. Because  to this delay, I and other  passengers lost the  direct flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was  three hours later  at the time of arrival. When  they booked this  ticket one of  my main reasons that made me  decline it was  the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an . Turning it  was an 8 hour layover I  think is unacceptable  for very poor  passenger service. It shows lack of  regard for your  customers and lack  in commitment by this company to  delivering to their customers what they were promised and  what they paid for. I am very disappointed by  my experience."
1.0,"Year after year  the British Airways ' service on the same route (Washington-London) is becoming  unreliable We just had one bad experience after another  on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice  were bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours  in the airport  for this COVID . Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept  advising us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show  evidence of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told  me we needed  ot go to the basement to  get a COVID test to show  positive results. They  cost us $250 per person for a rapid COVID , which was an outrage and  completely unnecessary. We  would have gotten the test done  for a cheaper rate had we  understood that this  was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they  offered food with  tons of cheese  for me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA  cancelled our Samsonite  bags and they told us at  the airport that we needed to  order this online. We have been  trying to resolve  our issue since July and after asking us for  something like 10  days they are  finally giving us the run around.  "
1.0,"BA used to  be my go To carrier and  still am a  loyal member. However , service seems to have gone hugely downhill. Flights  get cancelled, the  occasional alternative flights are offered and  whilst in theory  they can cancel  or amend bookings  manually or on  the app, invariably this is not  possible You cannot contact them by  phone and you  could find yourself  stuck on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone.  If they are  closed due to cancelled flights they  seem to employ  people to answer calls and emails promptly. I was stunned by the  recent cancellation to  my Catania flight  two weeks before  I was due to travel. "
5.0,"The entertainment system was working badly, the screen was freezing every time I wanted to open flight map. Though the aircraft was 8 years only, the window blinds worked with delays. The crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be  another short-haul flight.  When flying with Aeroflot and S7 Airlines, I expected to receive an excellent BA service, but I got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle  with water. I think it’s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like this. I can get  that hot meals on board are now rare. I loved the most comfortable seats in my life! I tend to have problems with sleeping on board, but this time I didn’t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff. "
10.0,I flew on  US Airways Cheapest  fare which was a Hand Baggage  Free fare in Economy Class. Despite  it being the  cheapest fare you  could actually carry two pieces of  hand luggage both  costing up to  10 each. The  bang for money  difference is incredible. The ground staff at London Heathrow  was very polite  but helpful. The plane was clean  but the cabin crew were very  friendly and polite. It was a  short haul flight but we were  allowed a free  pack of crisps and a bottle  of water. There 's Wifi onboard  but we paid  extra for the  full flight access  wifi and it was great. It was fast enough to stream a  movie on Netflix.  When you are  choosing between a  low cost carrier  or a premium  one like BA  pay the extra  to fly with the premium carrier.  Between the generous  carry luggage allowance  and the free snacks on board  you may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.
8.0,Very efficient evening bag drop. Security quick. Galleries North ampton was very  nice Food and drinks fine. Plane left on time  and ordered door was ok. Early arrival. Fortunately only  two bags were  being given priority tags and came out early!
1.0,"I and my  2 year 11  month baby girl , business class  to Moscow Domodedovo  to London Heathrow , 11 august.  When we landed  in Heathrow, my  daughter was sleeping. I asked stewards  regarding my stroller, and they said  she is going  and wait for  us at the  front of the  corridor before entrance  into terminal building.  I grabbed my  little baby, who  weighed nearly 15 kg, and luggage  bags (another 15 kg) and walked  everywhere I went  and entered the building, and met no one with  a pram or  had my pram left somewhere in  a corridor. And  I was no one to ask.  Just a flow  for passengers behind , and in  front of me.  On top of  this we landed  at terminal 5,and  I had to travel on a  wheelchair to arrivals  desk for passport  check and other  passengers still on  me own, holding  my baby and  a bag on  my shoulder. I  found no one  and I can  ask for a . First British  Airways representative I  think was after  baggage control ,  and explained the  problem and he  explained that I have to go  home and my  luggage will be  with my suitcases. ! No further  questions or help. I had to  spend another hour  carrying luggage and pram. I am  really frustrated, upset  & disappointed! I  can see that  British Airways do  NOT care about  people with kids  at all."
2.0,"For this flight  to Heathrow T5,  we were piled  off the bus  which left for  30 mins at  our terminal.   Several unhappy passengers  left and when  asked the BA  airport manager's response  was ""sorry -  we are still "". On arrival  of the aircraft  one gentleman who came on a  wheelchair had no  problem with his  ticket (I helped).  Good - since  my service was  very good. For  a flight out from Munich BA had not (re) signed up to  their now open lounge in Munich. To me looks  like a systemic  failure rather than  some one off ..."
6.0,"BA encourage you  please download verifly  and speed up your check-in, this is absolutely rubbish  and the desk  staff don’t seem to want this,  they want to see the actual  flight tests etc! This wasted about  20 minutes and  is pointless. The return flight again had no access  to the club lounge, you pay for extras such  a this as  half of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again (last 2 flight  was available at  all but this is more a part of the Covid experience). On board staff were  helpful although one did joke to another welcome to . On board food was very good for a  long haul flight."
1.0,They cancelled a flight I booked  six months ago for some operational  reason at a  price where the prices are off the roof. British Airways could not give me any alternatives other than  flights or a  hotel 
1.0,"Having been flying  with BA for  months and never  having any issues. I recently had  an arrange to  undergo surgery in  Budapest and naturally  had to fly BA. So I  booked my flights  to BHD to  Budapest via LHR online on their . Once booked  BA informed the  authorities and confirmed  my appointment. The  VERY next day  I received an  SMS from BA  informing me they  had cancelled my  flight to BUD  but not to  worry as they  have moved me  on an earlier  (& much earlier)  flight the same day. Only problem  was this earlier  flight departed around  2 hours before  my flight from  Budapest arrived. I  should have thought  that this would  be flashed up  in their system  as being an  issue but seemingly not… *interlude* To  travel into Hungary  by covid one  need a valid  exemption with medical treatment being one.  I had to  hand in a  rather confusing form  to the Hungarian  government website that  was a confusing  combination of Hungarian  and pidgin English.  This form filled  up with flight  information etc, emailed  with the authorities  visa and exemption ? So I  had the earlier  booking but this  way I had  already fly into London the previous  day and stay  longer in a . So operation  and hotel booked,  airport transfers booked  and papers amended  visas re sent , admiration granted  for flights re  booked what could  go wrong? Around  two weeks before  I was due  to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided  the cancel my  flight to BUD ! Needless to  say I was furious. I complained  about BA customer  services and was  offered a stock  email about covid  on air travel.  Simple excuse, only  having looked at  their arrivals info,  I had been  booked there once  before for at  most the preceding several months. So  the covid excuse  rang somewhat hollow.  As I got  back most of my money from  two flights I  booked with BA,  and they refused  to refund my  flights - LHR  - because who  knows I also  lost the money  they had spent  at a hotel  plus half of  the money I had spent on  London airport transfers.  Given the cavalier  behaviour BA seem to have to  be and their  attitude to ruining  months of preparation  for my part , the fact that I lost  some not inconsiderable  sum of money, I’ve decided to  avoid BA from now on."
8.0,"Check in well organised. No lounge  like Cancun. Efficient  check process. Given water bottle before  taking off, no welcome drink. Now COVID rules are being relaxed this  needs to change.  Service good and food acceptable. Staff  very experienced and  highly organised and gave a very  good on board experience. Managed to sleep a few . For the first time my tagged luggage was  removed quickly. This may reflect the  reality that our  plane was the only one into Gatwick at that time."
7.0,"Departure LGW north  of Aspire lounge. Bag from fine, lounge basic, on time departure. Cabin  is welcoming but  well given menu, water and amenity ! Looks like  some of White  Sox bedding options removed. Lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks , Not complete  return to old  hotel but getting  in Flight generally good. Early touch  to Club world  got off last which meant a  total of 75 minutes for luggage!"
1.0,"A flight six months before travel,  a month before  my flight BA  booked the flight giving the option to rebook for another day - bearing in mind that people have  children and school  parking wasn't ideal on top of  no parking for over three weeks.  We rebooked the flight- as suggested  to them and a week later BA cancelled the rebooked flight. We  was told that  passengers will receive  the refund within 10 working days.  Over two weeks passed and I  tried again. I was informed that  BA can't give  the time frame for processing refunds,  so no refund  processed yet. BA representative refuses to  give contact details  of the manager,  and cut the  connection "
1.0,"The airline cancelled my initial return flight with a 2 hours layover  from London, and my only option  was to book the next flight that has a 7-8 hours layover.  Right before I board the flight  to Toronto. While i understand schedule changes, and do my best to  remain positive and  accommodating i contacted  the airline, asking for upgrades to a best seat. I asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport. They denied my ask, no explanations and no empathy. Not only that,  however they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation. Again, not the change in schedule, not the extra  two hours layover time. Just the way they chose  to treat a customer who didn't do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute. "
2.0,"I was traveling  as my wife in business class  to Seattle to  London via connecting flight in London and we reserved  two seats together while booking the  tickets But mysteriously  they changed it later and when we got our  plane pass, they assigned 11h and 5d. Called several  people but they couldn't do anything and gave us explanations like may  be some one else needed those seats and there are no other  seats together available.  As we boarded,  the whole plane was empty and still they didn't  want us to seat together. "
4.0,"I usually avoid BA because of  their appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but  this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a  small drawer at ankle level that  is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced  during biz class, and is also very hard. The  floor was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats  just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever  used in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable,  cramped experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA's unique  and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles."
8.0,"The airport has only recently opened its new facilities and check-in and  have certainly seemed very clean and efficient, although admittedly it’s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present.  I was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms. Thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in Club Europe, the flight took off ahead of time. Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than  business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumably. Arrival into T5 was also comfortably ahead  the schedule, and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control, we were through the  queue and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing."
9.0,"We want to say a big  Thank you to  Daniel Ladjouze. After frustratingly missing my  train due to  multiple road closures,  they helped me  find and book  the next day  so without additional  stress I am  truly grateful."
9.0,"Despite sixteen months of being grounded by COVID, it felt almost surreal to be back  on T5, heading for what to us was essential summer sun in Greece. T5 was blissfully quiet, with no queues at check-in or security,  and even the Galleries South lounge was less frenetic than usual, despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape Boris Johnson’s  bad boy attitude. Ordering food and  drink from one’s table seems something worth continuing, avoiding all the wastage  of endlessly replenished buffets. The flights was very quiet,  and just 30 pax on board, 9 of whom were in Club Europe. Boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement  from the previous ‘groups’. Service on  the flight was good and the food was of the usual Do&Co quality. Landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form. Overall, a thoroughly reassuring, coming out of COVID, experience."
1.0,"BA cancelled flight  to Dec 2020.  This was promised in voucher form  by call center. We are now 6 months down the line, 13 calls of which  there is 40 % waiting time, and 16 email reminders. Conclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucher. Head of call center is keeping to her empty promises."
9.0,Last flight down  at Heathrow. Crew  do their best  to keep everyone  safe in challenging times. Nice to  know they have  provided a free snack and water.  Just a start.
8.0,"Board and disembarking were greatly organised:  passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows, from the backside to the front (business), minimizing the  chance for jamming. Same at disembarking: passengers were asked to remain seated,  1 row per row was called.  Board members were supporting the process.  staff could be  used distribute hand-sanitizer  at boarding. When snack was distributed my row (#8 business) was overlooked for some reason; after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food - staff was surprised and fixed it, This was my first flight since one year, and I  understood the COVID measures taken by BA - still it left some strange experience."
5.0,"This was not my best experience with BA thus far as there were a couple of disappointments. I was happy with the fast baggage check-in. This was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the  airline The COVID protocols are not  as robust as  they should be, particularly attendants need  and be armed  for sanitizer at the cabin entrance. There was a big mix up which I find  frustrating - I and another passenger were allocated the  last seat on the same plane, causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get  you another seat but I don't expect such at this level. Bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome. The plane arrived 10 minutes late."
4.0,Ok flight apart from they cancelled  the majority of  flight outbound and crammed everybody on one flight. After having my return cancelled 3 times  they opted for a voucher so I could rebook a new route. I had not  be informed before requesting the “E-voucher”  and I would  get to call  them to rebook (I’m in a  poor country and the phone tariffs are extortion). So not only was  this flight cancelled  3 times I wasn’t offered an option to rebook  a new flight online I was  ignored every step of the way.
1.0,"An appalling experience. British Airways, unfortunately,  has lowered it's standards and to my dismay, I've been recently having  a much better flying experience with  US airlines rather  that BA. Customer service representatives are  often clueless, unprofessional  or not bothered.  I recently  got my flight  home on 3 occasions and the  staff weren't interested  to helping me  fly home."
1.0,"Had booked the above mentioned flight. But the travel  regulations changed a week before the travel dates. The airline didn’t notify me until I learned that I could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when I went for check-in. It was a single ticket with the company and they said they didn't realise I  was flying from  Vancouver to India via London. The  airline didn't allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones. When I booked  my single ticket  for Canada to  India how come they didn't realise I couldn't fly?  no refund at all. Gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years, but I don't  make any travel plans for the next two years. That means my money is gone? When talking to representatives, they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was 'Onetravel'.  Absolutely worst experience ever with an airline. Am a frequent flyer, was trying BA for  a first time but now I  realise I am never going to fly with you. On my return journey, the other  carrier gave me a full refund  as the new travel restrictions didn't allow them to  contact me. A poor show with BA."
1.0,"My return flight  form Antigua to London was cancelled 2 times. When I call to BA several times their computer system didn’t work and  I couldn’t issue  the ticket, as the result I had to pay airport price for  flight as I  could pay online without ticket. They  offered to give  the compensation of  hotel stay, food  or travel if  given online form.  When I done  it I was asked to submit  information but link provided was to lost baggage expenses, not what I  needed I replied that link is wrong and asked  to correct link.  They replied that they wouldn’t compensate anything. "
1.0,4 cancellations for  1 month! Applying vouchers only to  finding out they  still work after  each cancellation! Terrible ! Do not recommend to anyone in Covid restrictions.
10.0,"I had travelled to India for an eye surgery, on my flight back to London Heathrow I was assisted by a member of the cabin crew Madeline Thomas. She was an amazing person  as she made  sure I was feeling okay as I had come  home from my surgery and was  traveling by myself.  she was more then a nurse and took care of my needs  as a mom.  Kate also made sure I had  had my food and stood by next to me . I was feeling awful because  i was in  alot of pain"
4.0,"This was travelling  home from Mexico  City on a  work trip. Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions  for the moment, which the staff  did an admirable  job with - but nevertheless a lot to say  on the state of BA First  for the moment.  1 - no  service at all at Mexico City  and 2. There's  no paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't  deal with the  standard Mexico City  flight 1 has  two lounges for  people working. Not  nearly enough for  an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the  facilities are incredible  quality but throughout  we were super  unclear as to what was to  offer The food  were literally inedible  on First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for  a 11 hour trip in First  only option really was chocolate or crisps. The first  chair on the  plane had visible  areas of wear  or tear and  required some attention.  The seat would  very easily convert to a bed.  Everything had scuff les around it  and generally looked a bit shabby.  Certainly not what  I expect from  a premium product.  They left my  watch on the  floor in error  so contacted BA  directly about this.  With assurances that  we have a comprehensive cleaning process  at Covid my watch was never  found BA has  offered their lost and found service  into a separate  website and in  this process they  have completely washed  their hands on  missing out customers.  Not that I  ask them specifically  why I'd left  a watch I 'd only assume  that one of  the cleaning staff  wants to keep . All in  when you pay  premium on a flight for additional  services BA isn't offering it at the moment. If  first is essential that you have  you fly really don't bother with first unless you have to -  just go to  your airline. The  people just don't care."
1.0,Charge £700 fee to make an amendment to a  planned holiday well  in advance. Absolutely disgraceful. Their site says £30 fees  and amendments and  if you ring up they say  that you ticked  a terms and  terms box and  go to page  10 of terms and conditions and  change it to charge you an extortionate amount.   Have received nothing  except bad attitude  or rudeness from  a representative.
9.0,"Good service the whole way. Nothing  special but it  is only a short flight. Plane  kept clean and  drinks were provided.  My only issue is that the flight was packed  - understandable as it was just  before Chirstmas but  surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to  each other during a pandemic, even  under the masks? My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight , no issues there either - just hoping for  one little more personal space next time! Also wi-fi did not work. I also liked  how they had a system for boarding and disembarking  - avoid everyone  boarding at the same time, brought  specially for the pandemic I'm sure ! I hope this is something they continue into  the future as  it made the  flights much more . Value for money marked down only because the Christmas flights were  so expensive! To  have expected though,  we know."
10.0,"I entered the  plane with a bunch of white flowers and a  flight attendant joked that I should have felt obliged  the bring the flowers, when she  explained that I  was going to my Mother's funeral  without the flowers  she was apologetic  ( had no idea why I  was bringing in flowers) but the crew were very  helpful to me  during this flight."
10.0,"He was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the  22 of December  to Moscow. But  since Russia has closed its borders, like the majority  of other countries,  my flight was canceled, and I  cannot get home.  I also tried  another fly through  London but the same situation occurred. On my third  flight I came to Heathrow and  wanted to fly away to Cairo.  It was declined  to another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires  testing as stressful  as the whole  experience was, the  staff were outstanding!  Also not sure is it connected  with BA, but  nevertheless I want to mention this).  BA crew was  very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent  with help, they have been a  huge help and  i am very  grateful for this. I want to  also point out  an employee - Shanell (if I  am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center  in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is  the savior and most importantly a human, which is  so rare nowadays!  Early on, I went to BA , but unfortunately couldn’t do it,  as my results  did go through , However, another  brilliant employee who  offered great help called her colleagues , arranged for  my booking to  stay frozen until the results arrive.  I come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time , was very  much professional, and happy to help.  Once I got  these results I came back to  Cairo on 24th,  when unfortunately, there  were no flights  to Cairo, the situation became even  more complicated (I will spare the ). However, here again, brilliant employees  from BA offered their personal assistance  and showed sympathy  and humanity towards . The nicest  lady I’ve ever  seen unfortunately, I  cannot catch her name, but I  was aware it  was her first  day at BA and that she  was Egyptian, followed  me throughout my  journey offered me  emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get  back home and actually did. She was open to  all kind of  help and was  very helpful for  which I can’t  thank her enough.  He also asked  my colleague to help me, which  he kindly did.  :) Lastly, the nice lady (shame , don’t know  the name) also  shared my struggles with her colleague  - who came  to substitute her on the position.  She was very friendly and attentive as well, talked  me through the  situation offered different  questions I can  ask at the  hotel gave his  name to call,  then offered to  drop me off at the hotel,  so he did . have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely <mask> to thank <mask> of these individuals one more time, as they <mask> been a great help both in physical and <mask> aspects, I honestly do not <mask> what would I do if I haven’t met <mask> I don’t <mask> was I <mask> lucky to <mask> these people or all BA <mask> are of the same morality, <mask> I do <mask> to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great <mask> beings as well as upholding the standard for <mask> airlines! For <mask> people, the <mask> that was <mask> to me <mask> seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it <mask> a pleasant <mask> so much <mask> surprise. As no one in"
4.0,"Dubai to London on 5th December. Flight was ok , seat comfortable enough, crew reasonably friendly but my  experience was gross.  Both flights  very full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each . Lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at . When coming back to Heathrow many seemed to have below their  noses Announcement made at the beginning about masks. Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or  under nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged.  One guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like  the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then  rest of the time didn’t see them. Of course flying in these  circumstances is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks, enforced by the airlines."
7.0,"Today is my  third flight since ! We have  seen three cancellations  that BA handled , But this  flight went ahead.  Checking in at  BA was fine,  their fast track  for unity at  La Galleries South  is open, they have an app , it seemed  and work well , my breakfast  came quickly. Followed  that with a  coffee (they are  after hours). Flight  on time and  BA presented A321.  We worked hard,  ordered drinks run,  and packed lunch  was not dissimilar  to the old  short haul economy  class but was  better in these ). Landed on  the priority baggage cane off late.  Really happy with  it and would  do again."
3.0,"I had a direct flight from London to Lahore and travelling with them was a nightmare. They did not have milk  on my son's bottle, didn't even  put warm water  with his formula milk. No kids meals, no snacks. Meal portion size was tiny, 1/4 glass of juice. You literally have  a beg them for drinks water  The Staff was  very rude and treated us like trash. If you compare them with  others I would  rate Emirates 10/10 and British airways 2/10. It's not at all child friendly. I will never travel with  them again."
9.0,"Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly  & helpful, one  man even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an  official website and listened to my  complaints about constantly  updated restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which  was needed when  operating in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone  should wear their  jackets as much as possible rather  that sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were  handed on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals  from Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after  yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled.  Ultimately my experience with BA was very positive though and I am  prepared to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper  airlines for the great customer service I received."
10.0,"i am extremely  pleased with British Airways as they  booked my tickets Munich-London City-Munich within 2 working days in a friendly  and professional manner: the difference between British Airways and Lufthansa is night and day. Friendly, professional and prompt are 3 adjectives to describe BA,  whereas Lufthansa is best summed up : arrogant, impossible to contact and ignorant. Well Done and Best Wishes to all at British Airways."
5.0,Boarding and checkin formalities are very  easy Check in  security desk was very helpful and supportive. Everything was nice except food.  i am vegan and there was no food availability for vegetarian passengers if not pre-ordered. My flight was 10 hour journey  between London to  Dubai and I was hungry.
10.0,"There have always  enjoyed great flights  with British Airways , this time  our experience was  truly amazing! As  it was my  last flight, I  wanted to celebrate  flying in Club  Europe which turned  it to be  my perfect decision.  The stewards working  in Club made  you feel special and delivered a  beautiful and personalised  experience and were  welcoming and chatty.  Whilst the cabin crew was the  best part of  the flight, other  staff didn’t let me down either.  In business class  checked in at  the cosy executive  lounge Preludium with  relaxed and helpful  but well organised  crew (although no  seats for Club Europe because of  ). The aircraft  looked very fresh and clean. Seats  were comfortable with  ample legroom, adjustable headrests and power . The on  board service is  slower than before Corona times but  was still very good. Tasty lunch  arrived from DO&CO  included fresh chicken  with oriental vegetable  soup and and  hot chocolate mousse.  The choice of drinks was wide,  including a very  fine quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all , perfect flight  booked with British . Everything I  desired from this flight was fulfilled.  Only one thing  you can complain  about is baggage handling at Heathrow.  We waited around  45 mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of Club  on priority."
1.0,"We had a flight to Santorini from LHR at  midday As the flight was full, we had to  hand in all  my luggage. We arrived at the airport at 7:00am, and the queue for check-in was incredibly long because  no desks were  empty It took us over 40 mins to arrive to a desk, and when we arrived we were  advised that the  airport had closed (at 7:25am) and that we had missed the flight. British Airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime. The lady at the desk  put us on  a flight to Athens instead, telling us that the  costs to reach Santorini would be reimbursed. We had to book two tickets worth £200 for a flight  into Santorini on the same day.  We have just received a response  form the Customer  Service service telling  them that we 'll get nothing. ."
1.0,"A flight from  New Angeles to  France via London  got delayed due to late inbound  arrival due to  weather and so  had missed my connexion in London , arrived in  London 3'25"" late  so missed my  original connexion on  to France and had to overnight on my own  land in Paris.  They applied for  redress lawfully due me through EC261  and their customer  service department refused , carelessly determining that my flight  had arrived in  London under the  flight delay window  for compensation even though my final was clearly Paris  as their CR agent acknowledged this.  After I pointed  out the error she ignored me  so I filed  the claim with  the Centre for  Air Dispute Resolution and BA sent  us a defences. They claim I traveled on AF65  which arrived in  Paris ahead of  me The truth  is that BA  at LAX rebooked  and reticketed me  on that flight . AF refused to accept me  with my baggage  until I paid  BA a surcharge.  And BA then rebooked me on  BA to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and  had to overnight , I do  NOT know which is more shocking : BA would  resort to the  truth in order  further support their  own position or  that their agents  do not know  enough to read  your passenger name  and air history."
2.0,"i was deeply  unhappy with the  effect of social distancing on my  part The plane  from London was  half or more full, and no  real distancing could  been applied. A  couple of people wearing face masks  were (over mouth ), as a  greeting throughout the  plane and there  is a fair  amount of time when masks were  used for the  evening snack (small  bag of crisps  or 250ml of water).  It  was crazy to  waste a considerate  amount of time  with masks off  when inappropriately worn in such a  tight space with  no safe distance . Also, only  a absolute minimum  passenger service which,  like COVID, is  fine but makes  a flight really  uncomfortable - or not, since some  warning was provided  on turbulence, with very little information  about the flight ! Disembarkation was chaotic to say  very least but  cabin 5 was  short and vast  enough to allow to finally distance.  One upgrade for  which Euros one was was available  which it didn't seem to make  it At least  it departed on  Time and the  flight appeared reasonably clean."

I  was due to  return back to  Singapore on 25th  April 2020 and  that flight got  cancelled Before my  flight cancellation, I  sent an email  to the airline  if I could  apply for a  voucher if my  ticket ever got  delayed so I  applied for an online voucher. But  then was told  because I am  only eligible to  receive a voucher  as I have  missed the London  – Singapore leg.  1 month later,  we tried again  and redeem for  my voucher and  there I was  approved But to  receive the voucher  you have to  pay to redeem  the voucher (which  i think it  is a complete  scam and I  got put on hold for many  days"

1.0,"On to Frankfurt.  We made the  mistake of exchanging  the April flights  with BA for  the voucher, because  in the travel  ban due to  flu pandemic. Big  surprise BA has  forgotten completely and  did not seem  to care. I tried to book  an August flight  with the voucher,  because frlights cannot  get booked online  with a voucher.  So have to  wait for hours on the phone  and speak to  a Customer service  tried to charge  you twice the  actual cost. Then  an email confirmation  for hours, after  they chased it  off (another long  time on hold).  The confirmation showed  they had booked  a wrong outbound  flight - service  staff denied any  refund on their  website and refused  to rebook for  that date or  issue a refund.  After few days  ago I started  it over again  - booked an  alternative outbound date  ( not the  dates I wanted,  much better) -  after 3 weeks , BA cancelled  our return flight!  Then I Called  for a refund  only be told  that it hasn't  been in my  account after 21  tries to get  them in touch"".  Such Things go ! It's how  we deal with  things that mark  as good customer . BA hasn't a clue!"
1.0,"BA cancelled my flight to Lyon, March/April 2020, because of the Corona , I could  not obtain a  voucher as the BA website and  customer service made this impossible, it  just sent me  round in circles.  Instead I opted  on a Future Travel Voucher, as  it could be obtained via the website. I have now tried to use the voucher  for a flight  to Munich, and was informed by the website that  I have to  pay BA for this. The Silver card member phone  box is inaccessible,  because BA has reduced telephone access  by one number. I have now  tried this number five times, each time I was  advised to call at another time, as 'in these  busy times, they  have to protect staff'. This is  also the same  message that I received the many  times I called for a refund.  Will BA not  offering their voucher  and trying to  scare off customers  and keep their  customers This is appalling business practice!"
8.0,"A short hop  to London to Edinburgh in November 2019 - efficient, clean and punctual. The airport experience was straightforward and I think flying from City you get simplicity but miss out on  the bigger aircraft  that are a bit more comfortable. I got my luggage quickly at the other end and I appreciated  the a wide range of flight times to choose from."
1.0,Total rip off.  UK Airways cancels  flight due to  ill Covid 19. When i use the voucher they issued me they  expect me to  pay a additional $1000 for a first class seat. British Airways way to rip people off and profit  off a world pandemic. 
2.0,"I booked flights to Rome from the US and  back home through London to LAX  in February of  last year for  Friday 1st of August. I booked  through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the  American website, paying  over $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for  myself and my group to travel  between Italy and England on this trip as (1)  they are not allowed to travel outside the US,  so as Americans we are not allowed to travel  in Italy or  England and (3) the US government has not processed one of the  passport renewal we  needed to fly which was mailed  back early February.  We had to cancel all of our hotels, AirB&Bs, car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer  services a number  of times, finally got through today after an hour  on hold. I asked how to  obtain a refund or voucher for  the business class  seating selection that  I had paid for and was told that I  could lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or  discounts allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and  American have a partnership that should  make it relatively seamless to book  or travel on  both or both  flights though I was shocked at  having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our  seat in business , but this  has apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are  traveling on that  they might be able to get  both a voucher or a refund. I was prepared  only to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for  Europe as I understand that BA  ( all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but  I was not prepared to be  financially ripped off  at BA. I  must wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money  and miles I paid American Airlines  for this flight. I am at a loss as  though what I can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my  power and for  which an airline partner that I valued traveling on  and refusing to offer a voucher or a refund.  I will never again do anything that gives revenue to British Airways."
1.0,"Originally booked a  flight to Spain for mid-March 2020  on American Airlines, British Airways and  unfortunately I needed  a cancel this  flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to  Spain that began  this March. I  were able to  make my flight at no cost,  this is great, but given the  fact that my  plane left the day the travel ban began, those  charges should have  gotten refunded. If  I were to  have boarded that  plane I would 've been quarantined  in Europe and  would have faced  the mandatory quarantine  for re-entry to the US IF I were able  to return at . The fact  the British Airways  would not cancel  my flight is  disappointing me since  I do not  think who in their right mind would have traveled  in Spain with  a travel ban ! The response I received from  US Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight,  no refund or  replacement is available.  Im very disappointed  in the response  of them during a global pandemic , will not  book another flight  with them."
1.0,"I booked London  and Tel Aviv  for Jan 2020,  I attend a  college reunion. I  booked economy. BA then sent me  an upgrade offer which i accepted  as an additional  cost So I  can fly Premium  and the new  route Covid hit  and they cancelled  that flight. No  fault of theirs.  Any subsequent behaviour,  was all their  fault After a  desperate effort to  contact them, i  finally offered a  complete refund. This  took months and many calls to  cancel and they deducted £150 as  the service fee  for the upgrade.  Calls and e-mails  which result in  that same robotic response. As you made a post booking change we  are unable to  provide a full  payment "
1.0,"I booked my  return flight from San Diego to Barcelona in September 2020. I have since needed to  cancel this flight due to the  cost and the uncertainty of travel,  compared to other  reasons I was  asked to change  my flight at  extra cost, which  was great. However, this is my honeymoon and I paid in advance for seats to  ensure I sat  next to my  will be wife.  This was more  then $1,000 in additional cost. The  response I received  from British Airways  is that it  does not matter  the reason, unless  you cancel the flight, no refund able voucher is  needed I then  questioned if I  want to make  certain I sat  next to my would be wife,  and expected me  not pay again?  My answer was : I'm very disappointed in the  attitude from them  in a global  market where travel is not safe  so we have  little idea when it will be  safe again."
1.0,"The company is withholding my money  and cancelling my  flights due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucher. Even  though I called to explain why a voucher is  necessary since we are under a travel bane. Initially, they had said no refunds, the only thing to do was get a voucher. After  you had ordered they announce you  will get refund if flight is  delayed and you don’t have voucher. ."
1.0,Tokyo to London.  Two hours without  something to eat  and the sandwich  I was given  was inedible. There  is no bar code and soft  drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a  matter of hours.  Complete waste of  time having paid  into Premium Economy.  I am aware  London was the  source of the  food issues but  that situation was  worse and has  now made worse  with a total  absence of follow up service from  Qatar Airways. Their  attitude is unacceptable  but it is all about money  with them. 
1.0,Flight BA 282  of 11 February  got delayed 173  minutes due to mechanical in London and so I misconnected at London  airports and arrived 3 hrs 25 mins late. I requested compensation and  was refused -  After three e-mails  I told me my flight to  Glasgow was delayed  120 mins (under the 180 mins floor) and I  had to reply that I did  not fly to London but to  Amsterdam and arrived  20 mins late.  So they started writing that I was able to  get my original  flight which is  where I don't  know whether to  blame their greed at persisting in this lie or  complete incompetence.
10.0,"from Heathrow to Toronto. My wife and I used Avios and the BA Amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly  business class on our holiday. I was also excited to fly on an A350 for the first time and it definitely  lived up to  the expectations. The breakfast buffet in the BA lounge in Heathrow T5 was okay not amazing and there was a good  variety of drinks and comfortable settees.  This aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting, very comfortable spacious  cockpit and large  LED IFE screens.  I like the moving map but my wife opted  for the movies  but was impressed with the selection available. We both enjoyed the food , wines on  arrival and it  provided a professional  yet friendly service from the cabin crew. The A350  looks a lot  nicer than older aircraft like the  737 and 777."
8.0,"My wife and I used Avios and my BA Amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon.  Passenger check-in and  reception were very efficient and the  cabin (not belonging to BA) was clean but had a more limited range of food than I would have expected. Boarding  went very quick  and cabin crew were friendly and professional. I am a big fan  with the iconic  747 but we  started out on  one of BA's new A350's and this brought home to me that the 747 business class is looking tired and old in comparison. The seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality IFE screen was behind  on times. However, it was a  short flight so I slept most of the journey  except when there was moderate turbulence  followed by strong tail-winds."
1.0,"I flew with BA recently from Sydney to London, deciding to return  straight home from  Sydney due to the coronavirus situation. The first ticket  I booked with  BA was via Hong Kong. After  that HK closed  the borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang  up BA who  said that the  first flight was  as yet cancelled on the system  so they couldn't  just book me  into a new  flight yet. The  customer service agent  told me he  could ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by  then and he  could tell me  which flight BA  will be putting me on as  the replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to  find out what 's going on and was on  hold for 5  minutes and still  NO one answered!  Finally decided to  book myself onto another flight as there were hardly  flights left available and I didn't want to end  up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call  and even an  update to tell  myself what my  replacement flight would  entail so felt I had no  real choice. When I got back , I raised  this with BA. They told me  how I was  supposed to process an 'involuntary change'  to get a replacement flight -  that is not  something the customer agent advised me! I'd never even  heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out  to put me  onto a replacement  and he didn't  think I had  actually do anything.  And now because  I was given the incorrect advice, I am out ta pocket by  a considerable amount. I raised it  to the BA  customer team that I had been advised incorrectly and  If I had been told I needed to do  my involuntary change myself I would have done so.  The were extremely unhelpful and just said that they  already know why  BA was advised incorrectly and there 's nothing they  would do about it. When I  said that wasn't  good enough they basically just fobbed  it off and  told me to  speak to a  second party adjudicator if I wanted but they were not prepared to  do anything.  I will never use this airline again."
2.0,"During the time of Covid-19 it 's normal, that  the airline has  sometimes cancel their  service I’m ok  for that, also  if it means that I had to reorganize a few things. What’s definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher , you can’t  get their voucher , or for  the cheap flight - on the hotline they offer you no online  help and just way more expensive prices! So stay far away from  this voucher. For me as a  solo traveler I  always avoid BA  so much as possible in the  past I even  never use my  vouchers with BA..."
1.0,"Why not accept a British Airways e-Voucher, go for a refund. I  already accepted 2 e-vouchers and they are a waste  my time. They  provide no flexibility and despite the  fact that BA has money and air miles belonging  to me, I cannot redeem the voucher against a  very expensive non  air miles flight, only an air  mile flight that they don't have available at the time and route  they want. BA are trying every trick in the book to complicate,  confuse and make  things difficult and worse still, you can't redeem the cancelled flight voucher  but only by speaking to the call centre which  means hanging on  about an hour or so every time you try to 'phone them. I was a loyal Silver Card Executive Club member and still am, but after BA's approach, I will  be avoiding them  wherever possible in  future"
7.0,"London-Heathrow to Warsaw  on 14th March. British Airways stands out in many areas of the  flight experience, starting from check in  to ending on  my deplaning. Very  many smiling, chatty people throughout my journey, including the  airline captain, who gave all the information about delay,  departure slot and new departure time.  This is also  greatly appreciated in  the coronavirus times,  he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any  problems whatsoever and  reassured us, this aircraft is so  comfortable and has such good air filters that we  felt safe here.  My boarding procedure  is very well organised (no chaos)  as 5 groups  boarding sequentially. I  would try the  complimentary Marks&Spencer on board service but  also think it  will be a  lovely touch to  get some refreshments . The one  area I can pick on is  the cleanliness of  the rear toilet. Whilst the rest of the cabin  was impeccably clean, the toilet was filthy. "
1.0,"Just before the borders were closed in South Africa due to Corona Virus, I went to the Airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there  were no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will  give me more  than a flight  attendant enquire. Next day I managed to get on  board the flight.  But due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft  on arrival to terminal 5. I  am one of  those last passengers  to leave the  Aircraft I realised my mistake after  it passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft. They gave me a  hotline to call and I have been calling the number since March, so far it  had been zero positive response because  we are using  the third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find  your lost items.  Also BA does  not have means in place for  people to find their items. My laptop was left inside the flight  and it is impossible for crew  member and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane. Lessons learned, avoid if you can. ."

I  spend the next  day trying to  get through to  people on the  line for a . The calls  kept being disconnect  owing to high  phone volumes.   This standard of  support compared to  the other major  British airlines was  poor and obstructive.

Today I finally  went to spoke to the lady  at the phone  of their CS,  so she just  redirected me to  the website or  she gave me  the number. This  also directed me  a call again the first number I called already! After minutes of  trying again I spoke to another  lady she asked  me for my  refund and said she will transfer  them to someone  new when she  picks up on  me Unbelievable!!

3.0,"A journey of  two halves. Before  arriving multiple lies  of lack of information from the  BA website. They  denied my flight  saying they weren't  happy about what  I had done  and lied. They claimed that I  should re-book and showed lots of  flights - none  were in fact  booked to fly . BA claimed  all they were full. Then my  original booking completely  failed and the website claimed that ""all journeys complete"". Website at no  stage gave any  details about how  far it was  taking to fly  to the USA  to UK. Impossible  To get through to BA in London. USA BA  is better -  a total wait  is 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls.  Service at the  call centre efficient  & helpful. Chaos  to Chicago as  most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the  next flight to London and BA  not accepting those  American passes. No  explanation for the  changes in policy.  Finally I saw  I handed in the American boarding  pass and was  issued a BA  passenger pass. On  my plane the staff were excellent  - as usual.  Lunch was good  and verging on very good. Breakfast  a little small  and tasty. I  then got a  big cup of  Cinnamon Journey smooth  and some sleep.  Having stopped flying  there for 10 years because the  front office is  too poor -  most staff on  - ground are  good but BA  had an organisatiion  taking over as  badly managed: e.g.  when securing client's  and telling passengers  what is going  on running a  US frequent flier  - design of the business cabin  is over the  ability of the  individual passenger to  go to the  airport and so  forth I only  use BA because of the lack  a choice on most routes - whenever there is  any alternative I  choose that (not American Airlines which somehow is consistently  cheaper than BA)."
1.0,"I flew to  Dubai mid March  and see my mother, then in hospital. Three days after arrival my  grandmother passed away and I subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral. I tried to  make my booking , as BA suggest. But, because  I had bought  the package that included car hire  through BA site . I was  forced to change this online and I had to  call their customer  support I spent over 19 hours hanging on a  telephone trying to call the numbers  available online.  I set up conversations Facebook and Twitter, they went . On the  third day of  this telephone ordeal I actually called a different number , spoke to a guy in  London who said  he couldn’t help  us either but that he would  try and add  it to the queue for the  next line. When this was finally answered after another  minute and a half of waiting I managed to blurt out my Ref number, nothing else… before that call was disconnected.  Fortunately the one  person I had  already spoken to  on the Duty  Line that night then emailed me back and I was able to have a conversation about my need  a change flight.  This change took about 10-15 minutes , a few  hours But the  person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had  already been collected. The only way  I could be  made would be by myself calling the car hire company. But two  months previously, when  BA tried to  make my booking online I was  told I couldn’t  make this because  we had bought a package and that this could  not be done  through BA. I  can totally understand the turmoil caused by Covid-19, but never again BA."
2.0,"So disappointed that BA are not  making it straightforward  I claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid-19, effectively holding onto my  ticket illegally. Do  things right and make it straightforward to do it . A voucher is not sufficient. Or get more phone operators. The virus is stressful , without you  having to check your site for  updates and a 2 hour wait  over the phone. Very disappointed - I expect much better from you!"
3.0,"I booked my  trip to the  USA in May  2019 and had  TO cancel our  flight to the UK on March 12, 2020 .. 4 days prior to leaving because  a travel ban  is going to  expire on March 16, 2020 and  because I am  diabetic and have pre-existing health conditions,  the doctor asked  me to postpone  our trip. The British Airways customer care associates I  dealt with were great and caring and they were  happy to issue  me travel credit for tickets that  were non-refundable. Now  my problem is,  you need to  cancel and use  the travel credit  by May 2020  and travel to  The UK by  January 2021 or  pay all the  money from our  flights How can I make travel  plans by May  2020 with the  economy out of  business throughout the  year and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in  effect but I cannot understand how  you can expect  me to make  flight arrangements while the world is  suffering with COVID-19. I feel this  policy is unfair  for any consumer who has trust  and their preferred  and my preferred  choice is still British Airways. British  Airlines needs to  evaluate their policies  as a world  emergency make adjustments  as needed to  stay fair to  those who trust  BA Whether a consumer has purchased  discounted or non-refundable  tickets should not  matter because forcing  the consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is  possible and not  updating your policies  to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember,  there are many  other airlines out  now to choose . The coronavirus  is something that no one has  full control of. I guess the  short line is I think British Airways needs to  apply some common sense to their policy. I want  to rebook and  fly but I  am hesitant to  look at this  time Hopefully, May 2020 this pandemic  blows over for  all of us. </s>"
10.0,"Mumbai to London Heathrow. I wish to highly commend the professionalism of  our stewards on this flight. Someone had erroneously accused me of being  aboard a flight from Goa to Mumbai and coughing  on the journey. Categorically I was not on that flight, but in  fact agitation the passenger could not hear me when I repeatedly said so. The stewards dealt with this situation with tact, absolute professionalism and great courtesy. All  airline staff must be working in difficult circumstances at  that moment. They are putting themselves  to more risk than most to ensure that holiday  makers and business  travellers can get home safely and I wish to thank our crew  and particular for what they did."
1.0,"They have a  flight for March  from London Heathrow  to Valencia, and BA still show  the flight as  valid and are  not providing any  further option. The  BA website was updated on 17  April to state  that working closely  with the Foreign  And Commonwealth Office , to continue  travelling where travel  arrangements allow and where it is safe to do  so I then  checked the FCO  statement that was  last updated on  19 March and  this states: ""The Foreign and Commonwealth  office (FCO) advises  on all but  necessary travel to  Valencia So it  seems clear that BA deem it  necessary to fly  to Spain despite  this FCO statement.  We know the airline is suffering,  and the rest  the UK industry  and business, but how can they  do away with  such deceitful practices.  it is clear  you are expecting  you to change  their booking to  a future and  save the funds,  they are not  happy with the  official FCO advisory.  Does this actually ?"
1.0,Compare Gatwick to Funchal. British Airways  was still forcing  people to fly  to Madeira when  the Foreign Office  has advised against  something other than  family travel. My  sister and her  boyfriend were due  too fly to Madeira on 17  May for a  short holiday when  they found out  why the FO  had advised against  going there. The  British government had  advised that new  arrivals would spend  90 days in quarantine no matter  how long their  stays that's a  bit longer than  the proposed stay.  My friend contacted  them but was  advised they could nt have a refund as the  passport was still  open They offered  a voucher. If  there is an example of BAs  bad service I  was not surprised  they are in .
1.0,"Lower Deck Club Class seat, with the current awful,  crappy business class  passenger seats. British  Airways premium passengers are treated with  contempt at best, and Club Class  seats simply terrible.  All food was  hardly fit for consumption. WIFI broken. Crew morale low. IFE quality a bad joke. To  add insult to injury, the   snack packs are . What makes BA management think that business people  want (or indeed would retain) a  pack of socks,  one plastic pen,  or disposable tooth . The ongoing decline of this once-great national airline  is palpable. "
1.0,"London to New York JFK. Another  long flight with British Airways in Club Class, on a tired and old B747-400. The Business Class at BA is by  far the worst  in the industry. The dreaded ying / yang configuration is going to be with us for some time, sadly. In flight entertainment with tiny screen, no HD, and poor movie , WIFI did not work, as usual. Food continues to be desperately poor, and crew were rather keen  to disappear quickly. This airline needs major overhaul, and investment in new aircraft and seats."
1.0,"Given that British  Airlines are still  allowing people to fly to Madrid , other airlines  have cancelled their flights and the Foreign Office have advised against anything  more than essential ! What a  disgrace to treat their customers. If  it is how they are going  and treat people  it is hardly  like they are  having trouble."
3.0,"Fly to Buenos  Aires via London  - October 2019.  The aircraft is  very old with  small screens and  limited entertainment, which  is an issue flying +10hrs. The  10 hour layover  is a complete  failure The staff  were unfriendly and  hostile to me. </s>"
2.0,"Welcome to Paris Air group booking , I know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline,  yet BA appears  per usual to  offer no contingency  planning to handle extra number of  customers and it  was proving impossible  to speak with . After the  many IT debacles  this airline has,  surely it is  safe for heads at the top to roll? Cancelled  group booking for  full refund online,  and they do  not return the  original booking fee  and you have  to do this afterwards. However, the  Group booking page wipes all preferences  for your booked  seat numbers and you cannot complete  a form without  this information. A  10 year old  website could improve  but the user  interface app and  service that BA  currently has, and  the patience of being loyal to  it (for over  20 years I  may add) has  ran out. The  majority of this  airline appear to  live in a  virtual bubble and  has no idea  what is going on at the  front line."
1.0,"London City to  London on 8th  July Flight got canceled. The lady  working the counter  seemed extremely unfriendly and arrogant. Extremely rude staff and service. This is no way to  serve passengers!, especially  especially if the expensive flight is  cancelled"
8.0,"London to Beijing in January 2020. BA has really  improved their game . A few years back I  flew BA, the  flight was really  slow and avoid ant since However,  my recent flight  looks good. The  aircraft was delayed for 1 hour due to mechanical  issues but get  the majority of the delay in the air. Food  was tasty, and  staff are not hesitate to provide  food if you are still hungry. The drinks are offered in the promote manner, and crews are really willing to engage  with you (in the gallery when  many of the  crew fall asleep).  Security is a  tad tight but  thankfully I am  flying economy so this is bearable . return flight  has been cancelled, it takes like 10 calls /  mins and they finally sorted out  the flight. This  can be improved but I appreciate  BA is not  going to change  this to an airline which is  also BA's partner . BA has  greatly improved the  staff and the  service and professional  staff are the  finest in the world"
9.0,King Kong to  China Great airline . Staff were friendly and helpful! The aircraft was  super clean. The  passengers are diverse. Will definitely fly  again
9.0,"Flight to London.  The check in  process was quick, efficient and friendly.  As there was  almost two hour  delay on departure,  however BA kept  us informed and  they were given  some free food  and drink offering  alongside the food ! Information, explanation  & apology over  the delay was given by the  cabin officer which  all were happy ! The entertainment  staff were a  tad temperamental to  begin with but  they eventually worked. Good service and  great attitude from  our cabin crew  make the long  journey easier though.  Overall happy with  customer service."
8.0,"Back to Delhi.  This booking was  part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to  simply drop. According to the check in screen, all zones were applicable for our destination,  and we were sent from one  zone to the next; (which, given  our size of the T5 check in hall wasn't helpful) Eventually, we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude - especially when  I discovered we were seated separately; it was only when a family with two young children had been  picked up that we were able to switch seats.  But the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight, with great service and positive, friendly attitude. I actually praised them and told them  why my faith in BA had been restored!"
2.0,"Paris to London. Flight cancelled due to “ATC Restrictions” after Storm Ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by 2 hours. Arrived in London  2 hours later than planned initially and BA refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason.  First 3 flights to Italy for  February all cancelled.  On Thursday booked LGW/BGY/LGW and next day cancelled (for last week of March) a month ! Been a Gold Member of BA since 2016 and after seeing their constant downgrades,  i will go back with AirFrance/KLM for my travel  and AI found thr food and seats on Euro wings a shame."
1.0,"We flew from Sydney to London  and visit my seriously ill mother.  my second leg, from Singapore to  Sydney was with British Airways. My  return flight from  Singapore to Sydney  is with British Airways, leaving 23 February. On 20  February it became  apparent that Mum  might not have long to live. I contacted BA,  who said I  should be able to change my  arrival date, and asked me to send medical documentation,  so I did,  and an explanatory  letter Sadly Mum  passes away very early on the morning of 22 February. I contacted  them again the  following day. They  explained because I  was booked through Webjet, I needed  not contact them. I phoned them, they said they 'd contact BA.  No follow up , either. When I phoned Webjet , they said , no word  of BA. When  they phoned BA again, they said  they couldn't help. At this point I gave up and booked with  them paying for another flight. BA's  total lack of  communication (apart from a couple of platitudes), and lack  apparent interest in helping me in any way, astounded ! Needless to  say I will never use British  Airways again."
4.0,"Welcome to Malaga.  Very special, nowadays  but unfortunately not  much difference between  BA & Easyjet.  We left Gatwick  early & arrived in Malaga late.  All seats no  longer recline. Food , drinks are  still their Cream  but excludes tea.  Up your game BA, your product just continues to  look worse."
10.0,"Vancouver to London.  We are time when British Airways  has to be ranked as one of the very  best carriers. This  certainly proves the point. From the warm welcome at  our door on  arrival until deplaning  at LHR, the  crew were outstanding.  Very attentive and professional. The dinner was excellent. Excellent choices on the menu, accompanied by some decent wines.  Still had a painful back from running. A flight  nurse provided some  assistance came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me  then remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when I  arrived Very thoughtful. Seat was comfortable  but complemented by  some proper cushion  and a very nice quilted blanket.  Really good. The B747-400 is showing its age but it’s still a wonderful, iconic aircraft  you fly on and I’ll continue to prefer it  to the B777. "
3.0,"I am flying London to Seattle in Business Class  until May 2020,  but British Airways  takes around £100 each way for me to choose ! All other  seats I have  chosen allow Business  class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost. They decided to  move my seat ""for operational reasons""s.  What could that reason be? The  reason is the same. So, BA takes £100 off  flights for me so that I can choose my seat and then changes my seat - without asking me. What I get is an automated message (the next time I log on to  a BA website)  to tell me. There is a  reason I can  wait 40 minutes waiting for the  message to be answered and I  give up. "
6.0,"From Heathrow to Nairobi. BA First is so much  cheaper than that of Middle Eastern  and Asian airlines,  people despair. The brightest spot of this trip was being able to  use the CX lounge at Heathrow ! To cram  two first-class seats onto a 777 is quite an achievement. But it is the food that is the standout problem on . It is  terrible and it is shameful that our flag-carrier represents Britain so badly  in this regards.  All the flight  times were excellent in both directions. I only flew First because BA's business class is so poor. But never again."
1.0,"Dubai to London. My husband and I traveled together.  We got business  and my ticket was a last minute add-on, so  I Premium Economy , After we boarded, my husband came to me to give me  my pillow, so  he got settled and started sleeping. I was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husband  given me and  yelled that, There is a lady in business class is missing a  seat did I take the pillow. I told her I didn’t, and the pillow was given to me.  She stood up  and told her  I wasn’t Ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow, and I’ll show her whom my husband is who gave me the pillow. I located my husband in  the business class, apparently, his seat had 1 extra pillow and so he gave me the extra one. He offered to give his pillow to the flight attendant who said there was no need and he  could keep it."
4.0,"Back to Cape Town. Gone are  those days in which British Airways  was a great airline. Weird seat ling service that needs training, horrible food and no  chance in business , are  basic services offered  in most of  the airlines but  not by BA."
1.0,"Rio de Janeiro to London .  - - packed out seating, awful food, very narrow  and uncomfortable, expensive add ons (seat  & luggage), try to match Norwegian pricing on the Rio route, IFE  pretty iffy. My  feet and legs have been terrible for 3 days (I paid £77  plus an exit seat), the breakfast served was unfit for me, I took my own drinks and some food items. Long haul is getting the same as short. Come prepared!"
1.0,Go to Dublin  and London. I  travel to the  UK and require  my transit visa. Since when and  not if you  are in the  same terminal even.  There was no  clear guidance or  information from the  BA I also  have a non stop hotel booking  for Dublin! BA  fails to communicate  the changes.
3.0,"from Vegas to Paris via London. The staff were great, but the  trip was the most uncomfortable flight  from business class I’ve experienced.  The aisle seat felt like I was sitting in the aisle, a business class configuration  of 2-4-2. That’s  a tight squeeze. And,there were backward facing seats. The  passengers were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration. I was just glad I didn’t pay full price for this flight."
1.0,"I cancelled my return flight on  Friday from Geneva to Gatwick due  the storm Ciara. They rebooked me onto a later flight, then cancelled  it as well. Since then, I heard nothing more and I was  left on my own to buy  the new return  ticket I've tried calling them several times every day,  and they are not answering their phones, claiming they  are too busy to talk to customers. They cancelled  another flight, so I want a refund, but so far there is  no way of  talking through to them. "
9.0,"Mexico City to  London via London. My plane from  Mexican City to London was smooth. Entertainment was quite nice and so was the food; although I chose  my window seat and was never  sure it wasn't  in the window, but a wall! The crew was amazingly kind and  friendly They're always  checking on you, and we even  shared a Magnum! Loved this airline for my first flight ever."
8.0,"from Heathrow to  London A good  day onboard one  the BAs recently  launched A321 cabins, although unfortunately without  the in-seat power supply, contrary to what is stated on their website  about which aircraft s were due to get in-seat  power following refresh.  One thing to  add to the  problem of inconsistencies  from the BA ! However the  experience overall was  pretty good. As  expected an extremely  positive pre-flight experience at Heathrow's excellent T5. Fast track security was fast,  like expected. Galleries  and Lounge was pretty good, and  not too crowded.  Entry was smooth  with priority boarding  procedure as usual.  Flight crew were excellent and provided a very attentive  service with plently  timed drinks runs  within the slightly  longer distance of  the flight. The  seats pretty good  as a shorthaul business class offering.  Overall found the seats to be  reasonably comfortable and  quite reasonable for  my 5 ft  2 chap. So  far a good experience with no  major complaints."
1.0,"I was to fly to Melbourne from Manchester via London and Singapore  1 July 2019. Arriving late to board my Heathrow  flight the Check-In-Staff discussed my dilemma  through her supervisor. Only option being to find my way to Heathrow. I somehow managed to get to Heathrow in time where only the Singapore to Melbourne Boarding Pass was issued. I was told that because Manchester to Heathrow  connection was missed, my Heathrow to  Melbourne was cancelled. "
3.0,"Madrid to London.  People keep giving BA the benefit  of the doubt, but things are getting worse not better. This A321  is cramped business  class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a  less premium cabin.  Despite every statement  they make about  cabin improvements, i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost. Iberia staff in  Madrid were  not very nice, cabin staff okay, but overall Club Europe is not worth the money , don't waste your money on this.  "
7.0,"Prague to London.  This is the  third time I  had flown with British Airways. The flight departed earlier  that intended and got to Heathrow about 5 minutes  later However at Heathrow, there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early. A negative  experience at the  time partly the website’s fault, as we had done the online check in. We selected the amount of bags we each  needed It said we would have to pay extra,  and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay £65 for each bag. Apart from  the negatives and the delay, I would definitely fly this airline again."
7.0,"On to London.  BA designed the  new Galleries Lounge  and JNB has no understanding of  English as every  nuance of a  phone conversation was  just 20 feet away. Add in  multiple languages and  a degree of inebriation as you have a recipe  of an unrelaxing  experience Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was  more civilised, with  very efficient, if slightly distant, cabin  attendant who ensured  nearly everyone was fed and watered  about 2 hours  of takeoff, allowing plenty of time  for sleep. Food  was mediocre and I've given up  enjoying anything more  of BA's business class product. The White Company bedding  seems more of  a gimmick than  any genuine enhancement,  so breakfast has  been rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart  for a solitary . Arrival at a chilly LHR was ahead of  plan and we  boarded curbside 30 minutes after landing. Reliability is currently BA's strongest card."
3.0,"Las Vegas to  Dubai A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the  extremely high cost of the flight  ( paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial  drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on  this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of  respect of the first choice), no second glass of  water offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10  hour business class ! Other than  the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to  order The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past  this galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were  being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in  water until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this  is crazy. Only when the crew  adjusted the temperature  the few hours before landing (presumably  to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with  having a very dry cabin air, it was very  uncomfortable No need  I say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few  years other than they are very cramped if sitting  up to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the  shoulder width very  uncomfortable There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we  got to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so  that wasn't quick.  at no point did any member of the cabin  crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are <mask> addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you <mask> to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas <mask> fast, friendly and efficient. The <mask> was something <mask> the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels."
5.0," San Diego to  Chicago via London. Had I written  this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of  10 But I  know this would  be unfair- BA is a game  with two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few  years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European  airlines such as  BA and streets  experience of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old  fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled  due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel  app just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels  with no booking etc etc. Next,  my replacement flights.  The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the  BA website on a PC showed my replacement flights.  But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever.  When calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department  despite having a full executive club account that was  associated with the  airline and which  BA could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting  a boarding card , making it  from my seat  on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for  this flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me  onto a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to  midnight getting me home over 36  hrs after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA  flight which would  get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on . When I called they had  NO explanation and only agreed to  quickly change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I  arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes  right BA is  better than it was and staff  is doing a heroic inflight job.  Same old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can <mask> hell if anything goes wrong. And bear in <mask> I was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers."
8.0,"New Town to  Southampton The SLOW  line at Cape  Elizabeth continues to  impress by the  level of service , the generous  amount of food  or drink, including  the wine-dispensing machines.  Landing was quick , take-off was  right on time.  There was some  turbulence but the  crew kept passengers  fully informed. The  last meal was  the usual offering  with the hot  chocolate displayed on  a tray. Arrival  was 20 minutes  out of schedule."
10.0,"On 4th of  July before my flight's departure I  had my purse stolen in NYC  had all my  money and my  money in it.  Due to the  many strangers I managed to get  to the Danish  Embassy and get  a temporary passport.  When I arrived at the JFK Airport it was  very late and  I wasn't allowed  to drop off my luggage. With tears in my  eye I went to the desk  because they sell  tickets and the  clerk was so  nice and helpful , she booked me on to  their next flight  visa free, got  me through security  without having to wait in the  lobby and she  informed the flight  crew what happened.  When I finally sat down the  airline crew were  really kind and  brought me water  and food as  I haven't had  enough food for the whole day as I didn't have any money. I want to say thank you  to your service and kindness and for making sure that I got back to Denmark ! I was  happy with all the kindness from all the staff!  Once again thank you!"
8.0,"Phoenix to London.  Since moving to  The USA I've been flying BA  less than in  years past and overall, they provide a more than acceptable service. If you choose your seat in Club World carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations. The new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past  and the wine list more interesting.  During this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good. Departed PHX early and arrived into LHR early where immigration and baggage took minutes. If you manage your expectations with BA, then you won't be disappointed with Club World."
5.0,"from Heathrow to  JFK Done this  in a few  trips with British  Airways over the  years first time  and probably last in economy, old  cabin needs upgrade,  better entertainment system.  Great seats especially for 10+ hour  flight I know they’re starting to upgrade these planes  its still a long time away.  Probably only saving  grace was a  better cabin staff  in economy."
6.0,"Mumbai to Boston  from London. My  experience with British  Airways was really  bad The catering  is excellent on  both flights and even the service  was good. However,  some of the seats have very limited legroom due  the the IFE A blocking space  on front of  me Also, BA  accidentally misplaced my  tennis racket which  they checked in.  They have a  rather weird policy  that you can't  claim your single  sport equipment as  a baggage and instead, you have to check it ! The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport  of Boston. Also,  BA took a  week to deliver  the racket to  our house even  when it arrived in Boston 24  hrs after I had come. Even  while contacting BA'S  Global Customer Service,  they were speaking  down to me.  They always tried  and cut my  time in like  20 minutes without  ever listening to  my concern. British  Airlines needs to improve their ground  handling "
1.0,"I purchased roundtrip  tickets for my  daughter and I  who travel from Orlando, Florida to Accra, Ghana and  also purchased advance seat assignments. Unfortunately,  Qatar Airways only  sent me the seats I paid  for for one of four international  trips our our  flight I have  continued fighting with  Qatar Airways to get my refund for these seat assignments. They have only provided me with refund of $234. Despite several  telephone calls and  making multiple on-line  complaints and providing  them with detailed, my fightcontinues. Their  customer service is really poor. I will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again."
7.0,"Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA  over three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat  now so I decided to give  them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes.  To the plus side: I flew on new aircraft,  that were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft  ( with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and  polite as always , BA. Quality  and food on  planes has definitely  increased since the bad old days : soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches;  I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on  very large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new . Cathay Pacific's  is far superior.  But two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy ! It is really pesky and  available only to  select passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone  flying long-haul has to check in a bag, so  they just include it in all airfare types. If  I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the  point of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the  left rear half  on the plane  is empty! This  just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window  seating free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering  on short-haul. Seeing  as virtually all  those flying to/from Heathrow are connecting  on long-haul flights with BA and  have spent at  lest $1,000 on  my airfare, I resented a drink  or snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not  start treating connecting  travelers the same  than those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip.  Assuming BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines."
9.0," Hong Kong to  London Heathrow with  British Airways. One of the best  experiences I’ve had in a premium  airline The service,  great food and wine are among  the best I’ve  experienced The only gripe I had  was the cabin  itself which was  too warm and  sleep was quite impossible at first  especially with pyjamas  kindly provided by  BA The cabin  attendants did my  double bed and  it was a nice touch. I  did not hesitate  booking First class  on BA on  this next flight."
3.0,"From Jose to Amsterdam via London.  Much of Boeing  the cabin is  fitted with rearmost , not having  cargo bins (row  numbers D, E,  or F,). In  Amsterdam the crew  fill the bins  in the outer  cabin (row 42-43 , J) with  their bags and  so I would  highly recommend BA  buy the 787."
1.0,"Singapore to Paris  from London. The  flight was a ok, dated seating  and shakey arms , the most comfortable but a serviceable experience. However our luggage was  never loaded onto the flight, the  second time this happened now with BA and despite  the 13 hour flight, 2 hour stopover, and 1 hour flight to Paris BA did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue. Instead after  waiting for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing. Being a Sunday and most shops close  by lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing  they hadn’t loaded the baggage they  did not find  some way to  get it quicker than 24 hours  after arrival meaning  6 out of  4 days in Paris will be  spent without luggage."
9.0,"On to London.  It went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked  about this flight. Professional crew with beams on their  brand new aircraft  (+ important to  have a seat no further than row 14 in A321neo, as those  rows are the  same type Pinnacle seats and have better legroom), very informative captain who told us about  the turbulence before we had taken off (very much appreciated), on time  flight and good atmosphere on board!  The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being  at BA's Executive Club you can  opt for the food & drinks with avios, which  are very convenient. The only drawback  you could find  was a long queue to the  passenger check-in at Warsaw Airport -  one opened check-in  area for approx. 200 people is rather not enough."
8.0,"New York   Airport London Heathrow. Very good, staff  were nice, comfortable  and seat recline good enough, food a bit limited.  I would recommend  this to others , they are a very good  experience"
3.0,"London to Los  Gat Take off  is delayed by  4 hrs (which  was spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed  replacing - sure , outside of  our control. I  was flying with  the wife and  3 kids (2  & 4), sitting  on bulkhead with  car seats and  at the baby  shower facility. After  taking off we  noticed that the  family entertainment service  for the whole section - not  the cabin) was  NOT working. And  they were sitting  in an 11.5hr  long flight with  2 little ones, meaning sleeping was  NOT going to happen. We contacted  BA cabin crew  but made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the  flight the cabin  staff stood in  the galley behind the bulkhead talking , while the  cameras were dimmed,  they kept slamming  things as they  moved things around. To cap it  all we landed at 10pm ET and they had left behind our  kids car seat and stroller. We finally received them back 2 days . Conclusion, never fly BA again."
7.0,"British Airways (Comair) Johannesburg to Cape Town route is never less than  a subscribed, and on this occasion the equivalent of Club Europe stretched back 9 rows. Service followed the usual pattern of a drink (champagne included) and Comair’s idiosyncratic ‘four-course meal’,  comprising a tiny salad, a hot course that one could see before choosing, a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese & biscuits. The hot meal is  always scorched around the edges. Comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering. Aside  than the meal, the flight was  extremely efficient, with  departures slightly ahead of schedule."
2.0,"London to Bangkok.  Certainly not what  I used to , but most  of it does  NOT deliver what  is promises any .  Disappointing ly outdated and  uncomfortable seats, appalling  customer handling at  boarding and   terrible crew service ! The customer  service online is  equally as bad. My most recent  encounter was early  January 2020 when  they put me  next to a couple with a  young baby in  Club World on  their overnight flight  from LHR to  LA Baby screams,  will not sleep  and as the  cabin was full,  BA could not  help me. The  airline was very  quickly apologetic and  we just had  to bear the  12 hours long haul flight together.  Overall my dealings  in customer service  was appalling. When  was BA going  to offer a  duty free zone in Club World  for people who  want to work  to sleep?"
8.0,"Welcome to Johannesburg.  I was slightly  disrupted by 50 mph gusts, but  right away  , flight was  the usual comfortable  ride on the  top deck. Seats 53J/K are some  among the best  and long as  a galley is . The dinner  crew was efficient  but we were  late for sleep  after a film.  Flight crew were  friendly and attentive.  We were kept  updated throughout the  journey Arrival was  45 minutes behind time, but baggage  handling and customs  was mercifully quick,  and we were  at the SLOW  line just 40  mins after landing.  Overall a good  time"
7.0,"Had a very  pleasant flight with  British Airways. Both  of my flights  started off on  Friday and reached  in time. I  am really excited  about fly BA  since they changed  their aircraft from  the 777-200 to  new Boeing 747-400  and is known  to the queen  in the skies. . The flight  attendants are very nice and professional  towards passengers, they  tried their best  for speed up  our boarding process  and both of  our flights were  good and we  were off. Everything  was well on  my first flight  and also flight  time went short  on the atlantic  due to great  high winds. On  my second flight  to Mumbai, the  cabin attendants were  kind and respectful , gave the best service. However,  during the lunch , they ran  out of vegetarian  meal option and  used to fetch  more vegetarian food  from other cabins  and even give  free meals to  those who were  hungry Overall, my  two flights with  Boeing were good.  There are some  glitches on their  old fleet like  absence of USB , Power Outlet,  and IFE, the  small box in  front of you  that blocks your  lights  BA  may need to  upgrade their old  equipment on Boeing  737 and Boeing  737 they still  want to use  them on longer  flights"
1.0,"Los Angeles to London on 6th January, and my husbands seat was broken. The Customer  Service Manager was rude to me and made insinuations about our intentions.  This was a dreadful way to end our honeymoon  and left a  bitter taste. A truly horrendous experience."
2.0,Got to Cancun.  Delivery was late. My food was  frozen and it 's not possible to change. I  asked for the  bus which did not work for  us most of  the time. Was  told to report  and no instructions  of where or  when
9.0,"Fantastic flight. Travelled solo from London  Airport to Glasgow  using British Airway’s Club Europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service. I arrived at Gatwick around 2  hours prior to departure. All BA Club World passengers  is entitled to fast track security  at Gatwick. This  was quick and the staff were  friendly enough. The  cabin at Gatwick was clean and modern and made  for a nice relaxing start to  the journey. Boarding was quick and  my flight departed on-time and landed  20 minutes early, the crew were  incredibly attentive and  friendly The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked  trout served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely  flying experience. Had there been ever-so-slightly more leg room  for in-flight entertainment I’d have given this flight 10/10! A fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline."
10.0," Rio De Janeiro  to London Heathrow. Love this aircraft, only a 3  Class Business, World Traveller Plus and  First Class. 2 Cabins in Business  Class Front 3 rows and Rear 2 Rows. I  liked seat 3A,  in my opinion the seat, Window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat (at 6'4'' a little extra helps) very private , behind second galley area, toilet is over the other side J/K.  Finally settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal.  Airlines very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately. A good few  hours sleep as  usual and woke up about 10 minutes before breakfast. I really enjoyed  the fruit, yoghurt,  juice and the full English Breakfast.  All in all great service, Good flight and felt  very relaxed."
3.0,"Gatwick to Tirana. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because  there was virtually  nowhere for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag  in my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating  a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service. For 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream YouTube videos. They offer cheaper packages as well where  they can get unlimited texts."
10.0,"Welcome to London . Cabin crew  were amazing. Weather  was terrifying as  I drove to  London airport so  I knew things  was going to  get tough. Expecting  some delay and  seeing other European  flights were cancelled , expected the  worst but then  pleasantly surprised to  find our flight  was Snow in  freezing conditions, we were surprised but  happily settled in  comfortable seats. Crew  very friendly and  the long story  long after 3  days on the  runway waiting for  our di-icing machine  it finally made  it way to  lift off. All  the staff were  so relaxed and  friendly with all  travellers including those  that had connecting  as they sat  with each one  and personally looked  over their options  and BA online  forums to help . Non-alcoholic drinks  or snacks were  provided during this  time The first  person kept us  awake all the  time that is  clearly not BA  and that the  fuel machine was  working so much  needed procedures done  and were ready  for take-off. How  our pilot and  staff managed this  in these conditions  you will never  guess but it was a smooth  get off an  hour through the  airport a smooth  journey all the  time back to  the Cabin crew  and excellent service.  After business we  are lucky to  receive champagne and  the meals were  excellent Veg shepherds  cheese and chicken  soup both lovely.  I just want  a thank you  all We know  I get a  ton of negative  feedback but this  is to say  you can't fault  you Particularly the  manager who made  a real effort  and talk to all of us.  Well done."
1.0,The economy and you’ll be paying  less for an  excellent service. The  bus to Vancouver  Airport uses old  of the oldest  of entertainment systems and my food  tastes inedible. 
3.0,"A partner and  I spent Christmas  at Tokyo. The  flight over was  amazing the staff  very polite and  helpful and it  actually ran smoothly.  The experience back  there was completely  opposite The staff  is incredibly rude  and lazy. The  plane was 12 pm and mid  route my partner  went for a  glass of water.  One lady very  politely said she  was going the  wrong way and  told my partner  her head to  the back and  get herself. My  partner headed to  further back where  the were two  older ladies sitting and when requested  they pointed to a shelf my  partners got the  water from. Both  their TV's stopped  in mid flight , for a  delay of 40  minutes We asked  the staff if  they could fix  our problem. The  lady said she  would try while  waiting As 25  yr olds deciding  over which airline  carrier to remain  committed to I  can tell you  US Airways will  probably be it.  Poor customer service."
5.0,"Back to Hong Kong. At the  entrance to the BA business lounge  there was a  note saying Silver  and Gold members only. My membership  was just dropped  into bronze while  the wife's remained at silver. At  a reception desk  we asked why  she wasn't allowed and was only told I could  enter as a guest of my wife's. When I got to the entrance we showed  the boarding passes and I can  just assume the  lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my  wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest. No warm greeting, just a job's  usual high handed attitude. Neither of the BA reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly. Had they done so they would have seen that it was a business class ticket and I had the right  to enter under my own steam ! Fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer."
1.0,"Los Angeles to  London Heathrow. If  you could give  this a zero stars I would. They have the worst customer service. I’ve flown many airlines around the world with my family, but surely we will never  go with British  airlines again. They gave our seats  priority on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class  ticket 4.5 months in advance to  guarantee that our family flew 12  hr flight together. The flight to London didn’t have the best service,  the toilets were out of service. The beds in business class are the most uncomfortable  among all business  flights I’ve flown. The check-in process at Heathrow was disastrous. The most inefficient process with  no human assistances. The limited ones available were all slammed with line  up customers. I  highly highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier. I wish I would have done a bit of research prior to  flying with them."
3.0,"London to London. We had to  wait for ages  to check into  the flight after being advised to turn up 3  hours before departure time to check ! We had to wait for  20 minutes before  our check in  crew turned up. Once they did,  BA staff were  cold and rude.  Entered the flight and there was  NO IFE, no  soft drink or  water or   a map to  find the flight. The onboard crew were a bit  rude Serving M&S  sandwiches for purchase.  Our flight was  not delayed by too much and relatively smooth. However  our BA product is now tired and slightly pathetic. </s>"
2.0,"London to Bucharest.  On my flight , hot food finished half way through - I  got seated on  row 22 and  at the time  my food cart  passed my row, there were no  tables left to  eat The fitting  in the cabin  is horrendous. Seat  change from one  row to the  other 24h before  take off cost me an additional 13 gbp. "
9.0,"London Heathrow to  Janeiro De Janeiro.  All the usual  flights for this route but it is one of my favourites, this  flight today has a First Class  which was flown empty as it  normally only offers Club World. Flight not full, Seated  in 7F aisle  and no one in the middle seat so very pleasant. It is away from the Toilet over at 7A/B but next  to galley area which was great as it is a day flight.  Food (pre-ordered) was very good as usual, plenty of drinks offered crew  was keen to assist, again nothing any trouble at all. I did  rent some films , I had already been on a previous BA Long Haul so was not really  looking for much.  I had some  drinks as it was a long day and I getting a cold!  Started late due to a technical problem at Heathrow, they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour I must say I didn't really need to  get told they were trying to  solve the problem rather than return to the departure gate. All in all another very good flight."
3.0,"Return to Athens.  These aircraft and  the flight quality were good, but they don't provide  sufficient food and drink. It was  clear they did  already have sufficient supply for goods  they were selling, so it ended ."
1.0,"Welcome to London.  Travel slow, had to wait for  buses which were  delayed Also packed  into buses to tight with people.  Parking too far  to arrival terminals. Service bad from  London Coming to  terminal 5 is  The worst terminal on Heathrow. The food and beverage on board was  bad for the  price For the  cost of the  same ticket the  entire experience was way below expected  cost and time  with staff."
6.0,"Budapest to Billund , via London on 18 and  20 Dec. 2019. A320 aircrafts. Check-In in Budapest had a narrow timeslot  and 2 hours  before departure with  long queues. I  was not recognised  an Oneworld elite flyer (hold a Gold Card with Qatar Airways) at check-in and had  to struggle to  have 2 bags  marked as inscribed  as I was  denied lounge access as QR does  indeed honour 3rd party lounges any  longer unless flying on QR. There is no Oneworld  elite lounge in Budapest, so BA uses Menzies Lounge who would not accept me unless I was with  an entitled Oneworld , different from  British Airways. For  that I do  NOT have status.  Only London granted access to any  private lounge. Onboard,  food and drinks  at hefty price  and  water is not free.  Bars were full,  all on time. I found that the onboard charity  run by FAs  were inappropriate and intrusive. Luggage delivered perfectly. Return trips (2 legs) were both full flights but departed slightly early. Granted lounge  service in Billund  to the decent King Amlet and BA Galleries First in T3 in London. Loads of  good hot foods , good beers , wines. Onboard , is no IFE, no seat recline. Mediocre, not  ideal But the  lounge is among  the best in Oneworld and the gold status of  membership is very  nice"
8.0,we recently flew  to Cape Town in South Africa  to London to . It was our anniversary and  we were treated  to a glass of bubbly after  lift off. The staff were so friendly and I  cannot even complain about the food  serving on board. Which I might add I seldom enjoy food served on flights.
9.0,"Flying to Toulouse via Singapore / London. Boeing 777 and IFE ancient,  customer comfort and service superb. Highlight ing the TLS-LHR  was a (£5.50)  festive treat with  pumpkin pie, christmas  & brandy butter cream combined with  some G&T hit  sweet spot. You  could argue it  could be free , I’m not  complaining  I  will miss the  high quality of  food but compared  with the ME 200 you’re still  very good."
7.0,"Welcome to London. A good overall experience. Departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in Sofia, and complete failure to  obtain priority boarding.  Flight experience generally good, and arrival  service at Heathrow very good and  comfortable"
10.0,"My husband and I had a  short flight to  London the cabin  staff were very  relaxed and nothing was too much .

1.0,"London to Munich BA956 on 21 December, delayed by 25 mins. Dated not very clean A320. Boarding process was slow and  advised passengers to check their hand . Turns out  bag is half empty. No complementary drinks and snacks  will be served on this flight with buy onboard in economy. Never again."
1.0,"Hong Kong to London. I booked  a return ticket for my sister though BA, provided travel document details they required. However when we got to the airport we found out  my sisters middle name was not  with her ticket and it therefore  cannot match her passport name. They refused to let  me fly, after  much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa, they enable her  to fly. However,  on landing in  England I acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to Taiwan. Igot  lost contact with BAs' executive phone helpline service, yet spending a day  talking to them  may have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things. We have still  NOT resolved the issue of her  ticket not having her middle name on. BA are refusing to alter  the ticket information to add my  sister middle name onto the ticket. They have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her  middle name and  were not interested in try to  resolve the issue at hand. They were insistent on  speak to my sister who is from Taiwan and I told them  she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her. They did not allow this so she was put on the phone  and they only spoke English to her."
1.0,"My husband and I used British Airways to fly from London to Paris this past August. When we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags, was charged 4 times for one bag after I was assured charges didn't go through. Have been trying  and get a refund from BA since. They give you a phone number to call for these claims  ONLY to never answer the phone! They have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails. I sent them the  financial statements and  a card statement showing that I had been charged 4 times for one bag. Only  3 months later did they finally respond to the claim, claiming I had two bags and despite the fact that I sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed with bank  / credit card that the charges had gone through, they only saw two charges and since I had two bags they didn't owe me any money. They force you to communicate via email and then don't respond they owe me $258 USD and refuse to give me my money at this point. "
4.0,"New York to  London I was  also the last  flight out at  6 pm and  it is clearly  the cheaper version  by all respects.  The Boeing  777 certainly showed its age. IFE screen was tiny,  it was well . The flight  time was quick  2 hours) and  thats about it.  It is highly  unusual to the  level of being unfriendly to me.  The F& B was standard and not taken as  we had eaten  there earlier. I'm a One World  ticket and the  gate manager did  not greet me.  What a small  flight and in the grand scheme  that things means  nothing but is  no acknowledgement that you spend time  and money with  a carrier (usually  only by a  mile or two). </s>"
1.0,"Back to London.  As with an  agreed purchase price for each of  our roundtrip tickets  of my wife and daughter, BA  charged an additional  fee for seat  reservation to ensure they sat together.  When they went  to check in, those seat reservations (in both directions) had been given away and family had to sit  in different seats. Back home, I  asked for a refund of the $250 seat fee and was told there was no proof I paid  with them. I have credit card charges and email  receipts clearly stating  the charges were made, but there is no process  or upload those documents to BA."
1.0,Frankfurt to London . British Airways. Awful airline. Put me and my  friend at opposite  end of the plane even though we booked together. Gave me middle seat even though many others were free. A childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you  do book biz class. Avoid.
1.0,Flying to Glasgow with British Airways. Flight is again delayed it’s not  because it’s a  one off as  it delayed every week like a  big joke. Really  a poor yet  extremely expensive airline  which I wouldn’t recommend to any  one
9.0,"London to San Francisco. This flight  was a delight. Friendly, relaxed crew, good food and  drink and a main deck Club World cabin that was nearly empty. If you manage your expectations with BA Club World and everything goes as it should then you shouldn't be disappointed. Yes the rollout of the new Club World Suite has been a long time coming however the food service  had improved considerably - BA are trying valiantly to  reclaim their long gone moniker of  "" Favourite Airline"". The 747 has seen better days however given they're being removed from most airline's passenger  schedules you should take the opportunity to fly one before they're gone. I'm gradually regaining  my confidence in BA."
1.0,Flying to Belfast.  Great service in  Dublin but absolutely  horrendous in T5 at Heathrow. Very rude check in  process when told we had to  fill out boarding  pass and also for our suitcases.  Quite disgusted. Cabin ets were lovely  on the 12.40 am to Belfast on 9th December.
9.0,"London to Singapore. I was apprehensive about flying BA Club World after reading many negative  reviews I was however, surprised. Firstly, they are not on part with SQ or QR - but to be fair, I found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings. You get what you pay for. The  seat while old,  are perfectly comfortable with plenty of  padding The window seats are best for privacy. I am tall and  experienced no issues . In fact, I slept for almost 7 hours.  Customer service and food out of London was top notch, fresh and plentiful, which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive  in Qantas. Service was consistent, polite and very attentive.  Sugar and water continually topped up. I was truly impressed The return  trip service was  below average and quite sloppy but let’s focus on the positives!"
1.0,"Toulouse to London. I'm a able bodied, fit BA customer and Silver member and was seated at an Emergency Exit seat. I'd put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions. A cabin crew member, came to  the row to point out the security exit and safety card and I was listening to him and responding, despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure , which he called earplugs. I explained to him that I needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and I can suffer from ear problems  when I fly. I told him  i could hear him perfectly, as demonstrated by our vocal exchange. Despite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to  eject me from my seat should I fail to follow his order. After I begrudgingly took them off, he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and I pointed out I already had! I then asked to speak to the purser, who came to see me after take off. I told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed Customer Care training or indeed to look for a new job. I wrote in to British Airways with my complaint,  however they have  never even bothered to respond. Awful, rude airline."
8.0,London Heathrow to Stockholm. Business class  flight is what it is. Seats  roughly the same  size in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat.  Instead you get served drinks and  a Proper gin for the G&T and good food.
1.0,Johannesburg to London. We had limited recline seats on  the 11 hour  long flight. At checked in we asked and were  told we had good seats. Completed a complaint and asked why BA thought this was  true how come  their representatives are allowed to lie. Never flying BA again.
7.0,"Johannesburg to London.  The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at  BA has failed to resolve the  problems when passengers from the two evening flights to  Manchester descend on it. There's more table space for eating and the food has improved,  but poor acoustics mean intrusion on  flights Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion  in group queues. The predominantly young,  young fleet crew  seemed competent but lacked finesse and  communication on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service  takes ages because of some unidentified problem with heating  our main course.  the food itself wasn't at all  bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn't too  bad and we both slept quite well. Arrival was  15 minutes ahead  of schedule and baggage collection was quick. Overall, a good flight despite the aged Club World product."
9.0,"London Heathrow to Miami. Flying the Boeing 747-400. Unfortunately  BA hasn't done much work on  the first class  for these aircraft.  These are flat , but you  have that wedge  on the front that even for my 6'1"" makes the beds small.  Also since it's so narrow your  feet get clamped  so you sleep  onto your side.  These seats are  business class on for example Qatar ! And I still think a  first class ticket  would include WiFi! But as always  customer service excel and the crew are so friendly , helpful. Meals  were impeccable."
8.0,Back to London ! As always  he works excellent with service. On the ground and  in the air. They still have  some good gin  range for a decent G&T and  so if the meals in Business  is like the  food from the  UK economy they  look great.
8.0,"London to Sydney via Singapore. Flight left on time  and crew where fantastic. Meals were great. Leaving London  I had a chicken stir fry  before landing into  Australia at 18:00  and were served  traditional English breakfast  which I can eat any time  of day but wife thought it  spoiled a bit ! At Singapore, all passengers had  to disembark the aircraft while it  was refuelled and . When re-boarding  you had to  sit through a  bag check at  the gate. We were on the  ground in Singapore  in 1hour 30min. 2nd leg to  Singapore was great  the food and  room service was great again. 23 hr long haul flight was comfortable. We had exit row seating for  the flight which I recommend to anyone over 6ft !"
1.0,"London to New York JFK. We 'd booked on Brussels Airlines, two of us, which  cancelled the flight and rerouted us  to BA. The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow 's Terminal 5 were utter nightmares.  NEVER again will I go to or through Heathrow. However, this review is about BA's 747-400 to JFK  an aircraft that 's in such  dire sorry state that it should have been junked  long ago. How does BA have  any gall to call its service ""business class""? The  aircraft were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled , even fell  down on several ! Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly  and the food was actually quite decent. Aside from that, I now understand why BA  is such a horrendous and well-deserved  apology Never again."
3.0,"The first thing  being the shortage of staff. The  Business cabin is  quite large and eight across and  needs to be serviced by one  or two people each side. It  seemed that the  menu after takeoff did not appear  until an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately  when they were  arriving the staff were not up to the mark  and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man  to turn on the reading light and he claimed  there weren't any.  They showed him the one by  one seat and  while fiddling with  it he said  there must be ? At the end of the  flight I discovered  a switch. Despite  being a newly  converted plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had  also ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only  one choice of  three reds and  2 white wines and considering the number of people  on the business  class I cannot  imagine why they  would not offer a third. There was Port  of the menu  but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came  up the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many  customers had clutter  wait for an hour after end of meal. Most  of the courses were quite small , and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not  a big eater but I was  disappointed The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could  hardly stretch out.  The seats and  rows are extremely narrow and people in the centre  seat rows and the window seats  tend to climb over other passengers. This means no  passenger has a  comfortable seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design  and be accepted in the business . I travel  for many airlines  in business and  it is still the bottom of the pile and  probably the last one I would use. The centre  and window seats  get their food and drinks served  directly through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately,  on arrival at Bridgetown the BA  experience didn't get  any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast  food luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA  badge and he  just shrugged his  head I then found another guy  he worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found  about 25 cases  sitting by the  window doing nothing. ."
5.0,"Brussels to Bangkok  to London. Club  flight from London  to Bangkok on  16 Nov 2019,  seats 15C and  D It was  a Boeing 777,  with a 2-4-2  crew configuration in the business cabin,  that gives the  cabin a crowded  layout The seats  are comfortable, with  one flat bed  and good selection  and entertainment, although  still rather small  space The food  service offers different  kinds of starters,  second course and  soup The food  were disappointing, I  chose smoked salmon  as a starter,  with British Beef  as main course.  The soup was  mediocre mybeef was overcooked) and quantity  was economy class-like.  The service is  really friendly, but  very personal. I’m  supposed to be adressed by my  seat when I  fly business class.   While serving  their meals, they forget serving me . The amount  the cabin crew  are not enough  on a crowded  business class cabin.  During dinner I  tried to sleep. The seat is  made into a real bed, with  no extra mattress , a good . The space  is narrow, it  is difficult to make the bed.  If the bed  is made, there  is no place  you put   my stuff. I  have a real  full night of  sleep though. If  your seat is  not at the  bottom you have to step over  the legs to  go to the  bathroom The toilets  look small and  were not cleaned  often enough. When  we woke up, breakfast service was  slow  The  menu is good.  Fresh Yoghurt, pastries,  some fruit, and  spoke full English  service Overall, British  Airlines World Club  was a rather  crowded Business Class,  lacks personalized attention  but lacks the  same good experience. . If BA  want to compete, they have a long way to . I hope  BA can make  it up a bit on our  next flight."
1.0,"San Francisco to  Frankfurt via London. The head support  got damaged, so I had to sit 10 hours  straight forward. The flight from San  Francisco was delayed,  so I missed  a connecting flight  from London to  which I came  in to the  departure counter, but  got a new  seat 3 hours  20 minutes later.  Flight staff gave  us a voucher  worth 15 GBP. "
4.0,"I had a connection flight from London to Berlin, traveling with hand luggage. I got  into a automatic  security gate and the man at  the gate said , I need  not check my  bag  He  had no right  to grab my passport and boarding pass. If the  plane is full they should check  the lockers if  they arent any  bins which should  get put under seats and where  there fits more  than luggage. The  plane arrived in  Berlin 7 minutes late."
7.0,"On to Johannesburg  by British Airways. BA’s B gates  lounge is a  slightly more civilised  place to pass time than the  Grand Lounges in  its main terminal.  Its also a  bit closer on  ground transit -  and via the  more useful walkway  on level -4  - to the  C gates where  all A380s depart ). The new  flights by groups  meant snaking queues,  and at least  Gate 2 moved  on speedily. The  Small World were  about the same,  much maligned seats  and the small,  empty IFE screens  offering limited selection  on films. The  taxi service was  poor because of  the unwise introduction  of individual trays  attached to each . Trolleys may  have glamour, but  it does get  you to sleep  even on an  expensive flight. Breakfast  is adequate but  nothing more. Landing was exactly on ! Overall, a  good flight but  our inflight service  was distinctly average."
3.0,"Flight to Bangalore. My flight from  Dubai to London , 10 November  2015 was delayed  for 4 hours  which resulted in  us missing the  connecting flight. My  flight from London  via Bangalore was  again delayed by  4 hrs. We  was assigned a  boarding gate and  after waiting at  our gate for  20 mins announcement  being made the  flight was delayed  for 27mins due to maintenance. "
10.0,"London to Sydney  from Singapore. I would like to express my thanks  and appreciation to the staff at  my bag drop  point at Heathrow  when I lost  the passport on  Wednesday evening -21st . They spent  over 2 hours trying to locate it and it  WAS eventually found  30 mins before my flight was  due to leave. A big thank you to you , I would  especially like to  mention the cabin  attendants on flight  7 to Sydney -22 November who were so kind . I was  so ill during  the flight, I  felt looked after  so well."
1.0,"Lisbon to London. I pay extra  and check my  luggage to ensure  i am not  occupying more than my share of overhead space. To  see British Airways  charging me 50 Euros to check a bag to  my final destination, and then insist  that my briefcase  is put under the seat, in a cramped aircraft, to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags, is an insult. Will never fly BA again."
3.0,"BA operate daily  services from London  via Glasgow, its  a busy route  so I'm sure  my money plus  time is no  issue However, BA  buses are rarely  on time and  BA fee paying  passengers are fed  stories about the  service was delayed  due from some  further flung exotic  destination Because I  take several buses  and trains to  London after I  left Glasgow punctuality  meant a lot  for me and  costs a lot  about BA hence I'm very disappointed  about the service  we provide."
9.0,"London to London.  Very good flight,  smooth departure and  good arrival by  people very very attentive and friendly  people especially towards children. Food was  good since from  menu clearly announced  to passengers. Bag arrival was ok.  Great leg room and entertainment beyond  any expectation."
4.0,"London to Buenos Aires. We paid  money on top of our holiday  package to fly with them as it was a direct flight. Firstly  we cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a . The plane was old and  slow making it difficult to get up and walk  about during the 14 hour flight. The entertainment system  seemed pathetic. Not  one film choice, a random selection  of tv programmes, and no games. The drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between. On other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrush/toothpaste etc, no such offerings."
5.0,"San Francisco to London. A380 is a wonderful aeroplane.  Engine selection was below average. Staff  were polite. Fist time I used the call button  a response was fast, but on  another occasion I was repeatedly ignored  the button for  20 minutes. I don’t see how  it is acceptable."
1.0,"Welcome to Singapore  with British Airways.  Locked in like  trash in a  tin can. What a disappointment of  this airline. They  check you in,  so even getting  to your seat  is a debacle  owing to the  cramped nature of  your flight configuration.  To awkwardly stare  at your fellow  flyers who sit  just opposite you  trying not to  even gaze. My  flight was so  low to the  window that at  points it felt  as people were  crawling over me  trying get past  a narrow passage ! Would not , could not  fly this airline.  Economy seats are  at best premium economy."
1.0,"London to Mauritius. We are fortunate  however to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines. Without a shadow of a doubt,  this whole British Airways experience is the poorest of  them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight. I truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of  the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver. I begrudge flying with them and given the option I always choose a  cheaper airline."
10.0,"Los Angeles to  London via London.  Due to delayed  lift off I  was missing my  connecting flight. Thanks to the excellent  airline host service,  Sarah and her colleague, I managed  not be on . Thank you  so much."
2.0,"London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of  tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in  their extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack  is a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a  large TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection  needed talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019. I will spend more to fly better and actively avoid BA on long haul."
2.0,"My flight departure  is delayed due  of what the  pilot described in  an announcement as  another ""mix up"" with paperwork. Disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a ""mix up"" with landing bridge .. So the  passengers had to taxi around the  terminal until a gate was found.  They missed our  scheduled flight. The  man in purple  at the airport  which are supposed  To help passengers  on connecting flights didn’t know what  they do. We  end up being  transferred onto another  plane resulting in  another four hour  wait All of  that inconvenience is due to BA’s incompetent management. My  luggage would not  work and the  food was just carbohydrate filigree. The  poor attendants are  terrible It used  only be a  great airline."
2.0,From Heathrow to Lisbon. Mediocre. The flight was very smooth and arrived  in time. Cabin service left a great deal to  be desired and staff seemed to be just going  thru the motions. No bread roll  was offered during  customer service and  despite requesting a  bottle of wine  to accompany the meal this was  neither forthcoming and  it required a  drink before it was delivered. Not  another great Club Europe experience.
9.0,"Flight to Boston. Comfortable flight in  business class. Food was fairly good both ways - dinner for the  departing flight west , the returning  leg flight east. Got some solid  meals in on the flight back."
9.0,"Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around  three times a month thanks to  our work, and  while I almost  never have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely  surpassed all the  above We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew.  Although the flight  being fully booked, my travel companion and I were  lucky that no one was sitting  across our row , that we  should have an  extra middle seat, and therefore more  comfortable The best  part of this flight by far  is the availability  for Wi-Fi which I have never  seen on any other British Airways  flight within Europe.  In fact, the  entire package I  received which included  unlimited texting, was  free and incredibly  fast - as  good as my  internet connection! This truly made this  trip more enjoyable  as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight  and is extremely valuable to me. Something that British  Airways can improve on would be  seat space, which in this flight I noticed was  quite tight, although that is a  big problem for  me as I am 1.88 cm ! Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks  were served on this 2 hours  15 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I  almost skipped breakfast, but I managed . The flight  eventually arrived ahead  the schedule and we de-boarded quickly.  Would always recommend  it - and will continue to  do so."
10.0,Back to St Lucia. Great service  on this flight.  Thank you very  much for the  flight and the  excellent cabin crew. Excellent Service.
10.0,"London to Singapore.  You have to  commend BA staff  on this occasion. They were friendly, welcoming and so  helpful to passengers throughout the flight. Even in the  first few moments they were laughing and joking with  us Highly professional  and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness. Thank you BA for making a  stressful journey a  great one. "
3.0,"London to San Francisco return in Economy. The seats are small. Outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat  - it was horrible. I'm only 5'5 and female but couldn't lean down to the seat in front  behind me to collect my belongings.  If you want to get anything  in your bag below the seat in front of you, you will  want to do  a major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I 'm on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy  or warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating. Economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of Business Class. Asian Vegetarian meal was good as usual although the  smell was terrible. Asian Vegetarian breakfast in Economy Plus is much better. I will find an alternative airline for my long  haul flights. It's not worth it."
9.0,"Back to Venice. I have flown  this route and  returned on two  occasions and been  happy with all . On the  first trip we both had mobility  difficulties and the  drop in operator immediately suggested their assistance service. It  seemed welcome and  convenient particularly as the gate was  the very distant one. The flight  was to time.  Our cabin staff  were pleasant, the food was good.  the flight information  on the flight deck was good.  The landings were  very smooth. The return journey was  equally good. I  was very satisfied."
1.0,"Bordeaux to Gatwick. British Airways cancelled my September 11  flight due to  their pilots strike, with advance notice.  We made alternative travel arrangements, confirmed that I wanted to to cancel from my end in order to  claim a refund,  I received confirmation  with BA on  1 August 2019.  They refunded my  money soon enough, but I am still awaiting a refund for the 70 Euro cost of baggage that I paid - six weeks later. I lodged a complaint on 9th October. No action. I lodged another  complain on 25th  December and still no action. They cancelled my flight, and won't refund  the money. And they call it Customer Service! "
10.0,"Seychelles to London. Day time flight  in to London.  Customers were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to  window 7 J/K, Best seats as a couple to book as they are away from the toilet in the front cabin and the window K seat has direct access to the aisle. On-time  service and swift meal services, nothing was any trouble  at all and the flight was full. Easy access  to the club kitchen after meal , and great entertainment, I have  booked this flight  twice and love the inbound day time flight to London the easiest to travel on.  WiFi and screens worked great and no problems. I  loved every minute of the flight.  Very big thank you to all the staff who were fantastic. Looking forward to my next flight to  London in December"
1.0,"London to Belfast.  UK Airways bullied  your parents and spoilt a special  day I booked  the parents on  BA to attend  an investiture at the Palace. My mother had a  cardiac attack 3 months ago and  this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA  as the best  quality of service.  However they were  both appallingly and  repeatedly bullied by  BA airline staff. My mother suffers  with claustrophobia and  often requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side  by side. I  filled their boarding passes out myself  on seats 24c  & 24d. On  arrival at check-in, one of the  board passes was  not recognised by the scanner so  I printed out  another new one.  On going through  Customs the boarding pass was again  not recognised and  no new pass  was printed. Once my parents arrived  in the gate  they noticed that one of the  passes had been  changed My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started  with the ‘Geneva  passengers that BA  was only contracted  with get them  to A to  B and could change seats if  we wanted. Waiting  at the gate  to try and resolve the situation , eventually with 5 minutes before  boarding they were  let into the aircraft and forced  ot sit apart  having no care for their welfare  nor circumstances. At no stage did  I receive any  encouraging words. For  parents recovering from  the heart attack,  this was an  incredibly stressful event and spoilt what had been a  lovely family occasion.  They have been  hanging on with  a hope that  their slide from grace will halt  yet seem to be constantly disappointed.  I will await  a response to  both parents; I know they will  NEVER fly the  airline again but  we will be  paying back my BA Amex and  loyalty points if  the appropriate apology  is not issued.  No update! In  general don’t trust  someone with your  young ones care."
1.0,"London to Cape : We had booked business class  about a year  into advance for a trip to  where I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA  in a segment  with better connection  options through London  and Cape Town. This was a  major mistake. I had tried to reserve seats on  their website twice  but was not able to do so. Then I  decided to call  them twice and  hung up after being on hold for an hour  this time with  the call back option. When we  landed today in  London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told  the business class  was oversold and we would be  bumped to premium economy. BA’s representative told us that  because we did not have reserved seats, we were  on the bottom  in the list for business class,  and that loyalty  members would all have priority for  seats over us,  and we would  not be welcome  into the lounge,  as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for  getting to clear  clearance to get  into the lounge,  and they could  not print our  security passes (due to the down grade). It took  up to an hour to get  checked into the  room from the  time we first  arrived at the  connecting desk. We  tried to speak to a manager,  but at each  of our four  stops with BA  staff we were told that they  could get some to speak with  them giving the impression that they were trying to  scare off unhappy  customers as fast  if they could. At one point  they got visibly  agitated after the  gate staff issuing  our new boarding  pass indicated that  the down grade  were voluntary, which it definitely was ! After two and a half  hours BA customer  service managers came to speak with us. They were  our first ones  they were actually  friendly and tried to address the situation from a  customer oriented perspective. If British Airways , giving bulkhead  seats in premium  economy and basic lounge access to  our business class  which is adequate  enough service for  a downgrade from  a paid business  flight on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not  consider booking flights  with BA again."
5.0,"from Jose to : The TV screen of 12F was broken, could not be locked into position that would allow to watch movies. Flight  attendants could not  fix it, and suggested to move to a different  one which we slipped on purpose  when checked in. The back of the seat in  particular was dirty.  The tray on  flight 12D where  breakfast was moved  also had a  crack on the right side, and  the TV screen  was not sensitive  enough to be be operated by touch. Although my  husband in 12E and me turned in the breakfast cards together, the  flight attendant insisted  I don’t have  time and was  not planning to wake him up and serve him !  Flight  crews were doing  our best, but  it seems that  we were understaffed."
4.0,"From Heathrow to  Southampton Boarding efficient.  It was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand , By doing  this they would  gain priority boarding. I took up the offer, too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane. The aircraft  is only two months old and I was sat at the back  of the plane - 36 F.  I am sure Ryanair have more room. British Airways  using this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost  experience under a cloak of legacy  airline legitimacy."
8.0,Flight from Gatwick to Barbados. Check in and business lounge were good. It looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks  that is a positive. Breakfast was good. Flight left on time boarding well run. I have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok. New  seats but that does come with  a IFE system which is way  better than the old Rockwell Collins systems. Food was fine and service friendly.
9.0,"we were not supposed to be  flying this flight but had been bumped from our Icelandair flight and  booked onto BA direct from Toronto  via London Heathrow.  So tried to get it changed as we were  about to fly into Gatwick. The  flight was quite  pleasant Service was  excellent and the chicken tikka masala  very tasty. The  message onboard was  the flight was on time, and  flight was amazingly smooth."
1.0,"I was travelling from Jeddah to London with a bag. I arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed,  i tried my best but there  were no staff to help me so I have to leave my  luggage as I  was not allowed to take the bag on the plane. In London I made a complaint but they were saying that we can’t do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about 1 hour and 47 minutes of wait"
3.0,"Zurich to London return. Both legs travelled with hand  bags only, and I could not choose a seat  before paying. Fair enough but when there are 3  full rows either  direction of 3 strangers cramped into  one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid , premium price seems mean to  argue the least. Hand Luggage fares are last to board, make them uncomfortable on board, no free food nor drink."
10.0,"San Francisco to  Seattle Efficient check  out by friendly  staff who offered  the upgrade to  seat at $760  per person which  we declined. Refurbished  cabin was spacious , comfortable with  the selection of  amenities Boarding on  site but could  of been better controlled. Flight left  and landed ahead  as schedule. Flight  operations were excellent  but the food  was vastly improved compared to our  previous trip. Business  class is not  recommended but we  enjoyed an excellent flight with no  problems"
10.0,Welcome to Belfast.  Checking in was  quick and efficient  by using the  BA Terminal-5 First  Class check in  the security area was really good and I was  checked into the  flight Great selection  for food and  drinks early morning.  Also really like  my BA boarding  experience i.e.by Group ! The onboard  entertainment and quality  buffet breakfast served  is excellent. Overall  very happy with  my short flight  by BA.
1.0,"From Gatwick to  fly with British Airways. Worst customer  service I have ever had after  changing flights due  to strike action, no response and  when we did it was weeks between getting answers only to be told it's not  your fault and  would not pay towards cost of changing flights back home."
1.0,"Frankfurt to London.  Flight attendants very kind when flying in. Return flight was canceled at London City Airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking,  boarding voucher and transportation arranged. That  can be done far more efficiently.  Limited water, nothing, no necessities."
10.0,"Back to San  Jose via London.  I had an awesome experience with  one of customer  service representatives at  British Airways. I  provided them with  me to a  bank and was  led across a  lady named Florencia.  She not only  helped gather all  info (bank, address ), required for  payment but also  make the payment !! That was  just over and  thats what I  wanted Great job!  Your service is  awesome"
2.0,"go to London.  had poor experience my flight with  is the 2-4-2  flight is not nice as much as crowded as economical class. One  window closed (nobody  bothered to repair ), on one point BA even better than asian  but its even more freezing. why  did we need to freeze in such a 9  hour trip ?  No staff to answer my question. no staff to make it better.  A good point,  my seat are surprisingly comfortable but  nothing to make  them better."
1.0,"London to Malaga.  A terminally ill airline packed with  hostile staff full  blown attitude. At the checking at Gatwick airport, I  am told the  flights might well  have delayed of 2h as not  available yet from  my SMS confirmed the delay without  the new time of departure and  without a link  on flight status.  In Gatwick, there are no arrival/departure boards prior to  departure for me  or check if  the flight was  in time as  posted online. When  contacting the BA guy at the lounge kiosk, he said I could  follow the link provided or go  through security where monitors are. Surprisingly  no flight was on time and  a text was  sent for an update. At the  landing we were  informed the aircraft  is replaced. No apologies from anyone neither ground nor  on the flight. We boarded at 5 pm and took off at  Super Stiff and no recliner seats.  All crew are  absolutely sociopathic and  FULL of attitudes. 6 additional seats are replacing the  2 toilets located at the back  of the 320  and located at  one very far end of the  aircraft in the  same crew storage room and working space is. Horrible low cost service  for a flag carrier ticket price."
3.0,Flying to London. We were not  given a seat  immediately upon check  out and were  still waiting outside  our gate for  the boarding passes to be re printed without any .. Everyone else  having a boarding pass was boarding  and about 50% were just looking  to the operators thinking what is  going on. Extremely  poor communication from  either airline to  and from the airport operators. 
1.0,"My flight from London to Singapore in premium economy  was the worst  we have experienced.  Our seat was uncomfortable, the flight  toilet failed after  3 hours, the breakfast prior to arrival in Singapore  (& egg) was  burnt rubber. They  ran out of  water and so  my wife and  myself had no coffee, tea or  toast with our . I used  a call button  and get some  water and no one came to  take my call even after waiting  more than 30 . Eventually I  lost contact with  a passing cabin  staff member and  explained that we  had not had  a drink and was told that  we would come back. I never saw the crew  members again. "
2.0,"Air Lumpur to Glasgow via London. The service started, first some drinks.  At my aisle  came a female attendant and a young male attendant.  I asked for an ale,  the attendant pretended not to understand what I was asking for. I repeated many times the word ale with my Spanish accent, but she still did not  translate it. The male attendant said “like an IPA”,  I answered “yes”.  I changed  into a beer and she offered me Amstel or Heineken, I chose Amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable. When the service  had finished the  male attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me. For the meal I chose  roast beef and asked for a  beer The male attendant realized that the empty can  were still there, took it. With the food on my and no drinks I started to eat, after  10 minutes it  was obvious that  my beer was  still coming, so I stopped another attendant going to Business class and  he came back with an option of Tiger or Heineken lager. The female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available  unless you specifically request that. ABreakfast I was offered  milk or coffee  ( decaf), I accepted, but there  was no milk or cream for  me"
10.0,"From Heathrow to Seychelles. Really great , boarding was very quick, the flight was full, seats great 07 A/B Good inflight entertainment, plenty of choices. Food was good as we already pre-ordered our meals, my beef  is well done just how I  like it. After a late 30 minute delay we landed on time into Seychelles, the  crew were very attentive, lots of very demanding passengers. All in all,  a good flight  and 7 hours  without sleep"
1.0,"Edinburgh to London Heathrow. I have  had problems with  much of the flight crew or service while flying, everything on the  plane was fine.  On the flight  landed I rushed to the baggage  area because my  girlfriend and I had another flight  north of London and only had an hour to make it. Even though we could see the plane , watch the  cabin crew drive the bags over,  still took 45 minutes before my bag came through.  The baggage claim service desk turned  down 30 other  airline customers until  their manager could  arrive by which time I was  going to catch my next flight , a different  flight which I  missed Turns out the next flight , on our  other airline wasn’t  in another 6 days. Hoping that  Brit Airways would  support us in  any way, we went to their  own customer service , where an agent, basically told us to pound . It ended  with costing my  wife and I  over $3000 for  two tickets to get home, spent the next 20 hours in the  airport and British  Airlines refused to offer us as  a meal voucher. We will never  see this airline again."
8.0,"Return to London.  This is a  small aircraft, with  18 seats, and  feels very soft ! This aircraft flies from Amman airport at 8 am local time  and arrives in only 5 hours  to London. This is a very  nice product."
5.0,London to Athens.  Qatar Airways is a glorified budget airline. A 3.5-hour flight and back to Athens and no food or drinks provided. Ask  them a cup  and water and  I charge you  a ridiculous price.  An M&S inflated  sandwich sandwich is  a 'meal'. No entertainment options either. No USB charging on the seat as well. Any reputable airline for  any flight of this length provides  such options in 2019. Yet they charged full-service airline . So there is a mismatch.  Across Aegean on the same route  but a full  meal and drinks are provided.
1.0,"Terrible lack of  left leg and  foot room in  Economy This was  probably the most  crowded space I 've ever flown.  Plus I travel  a lot. The  result was 7  days of leg cramps and pain  with no room  for any modicum  of comfort. The  total amount of  seats in economy  class is disgusting.  If the seat  in front of  you reclines, as  they invariably do,  it is even  less room. Shameful.  Plane food was  about average as well, even for  top of the barrel budget airplane food. I will  never fly British  Columbia again. 0 % Beware. I  would only add , the NYC  airports and London  lounge areas do  not have near  comfortable seats requiring  you to stand  or sit on  either floor and  their call to  service was disorganized . Horrible excuse for an airline."
2.0,"Buenos Aires to London Heathrow rwturn.  This aircraft is  extremely old, cabin  lighting is very  worn and tired.  All screens have  hardly been changed  after they were first installed. My  plane has a  smaller and more  modern screen. Before  taking off in  Buenos Aires, some  flights but not  many were offered , or orange . I never  ordered any. After take off, drinks  where offered, followed  with a hot  drink Food choices  spread out in the first row. Seats were uncomfortable,  toilets were jammed.  In the return  trip sparkling wine  and water were offered before take off, followed by  food and the  meal I had  ordered online was  some beef stew  over mashed potatoes.  Few movie choices,  small screen and uncomfortable seats. Crew : No indication  As to which  seat to use,  going forward in  business class or  in economy. Having  a Norwegian on  another B787 in  my premium cabin on the same route, BA is  the waste of  our money. "
8.0,"Mexico City to Barcelona via London Heathrow. The B787  has an incredible  experience The legroom  was quite good, the seat is comfortable and the  DVD has a great number of movies, series and  documentaries The food  were average, the first meal was meat with mashed  potatoes salad and  potatoes Not very . The breakfast  included scrambled eggs with mushrooms, fruit and a muffin, it was delicious! The cabin crew was ok. Not bad, not excellent. We arrived on time and was  one great flight. On the second flight the cabin  crew appeared twice.  NO IFE, no onboard service. It’s almost like a low cost. I recommend for long flights, but not  long European flights."
9.0,"Great all round.  Thu 11 October. Good price, easy boarding, lovely cabin crew, great iced coffee on sale.  arrived on time  with a nice  visit from the  pilot and flight  attendants after a  quick landing. Couldn’t  asked for more  and they reinstate a free drink and sandwich)."
4.0,"Flying back from Abu Dhabi in  a traveller plus.  My seat is  SO uncomfortable it  did not warrant  the price tag of the seat, seat cushioning terrible  and zero feeling  of comfort, I  got no sleep.  The snack was  served after take  out which was  pretty tasty, but breakfast was just dismal, tasteless. Not much interaction with  the crew, but  everyone seemed friendly enough. Would not travel with British  Airways in this  condition again, really not worth the price tag."
9.0,"Flew from London Heathrow to Abu  Dhabi Honestly, they were really good, legroom great, crew  fantastic - looked after us superbly, food and drinks  - bang on, did Vegas in  style too, nowt wrong with this airline."
2.0,"Flight to Amsterdam  via London. After many delayed departures  they announced that  the flight was  canceled and rescheduled to depart the  following night at  midnight The following night at 7.30 pm they announced  additional delays due  to the same  engine fault reported  24 hours previously. Finally departed at  night consequences were  cancelled connecting flight to Amsterdam. WE  also had to pay for our  air show"" at  our hotel in  London and when trying to claim  the charge from BA they declined  or offered to  pay for our  flights Arrived in  over 30 hours !!! What really annoyed us was  their lack of  information and disorganized  explanation on how  the events were . Once on board the crew  seemed really nice and just as we were getting  to hope this  is shattered by  the terrible food  poisoning on board  whatever that was . Our connecting  BA flight back  home was the same thing and  on arrival we were delayed on ."
10.0,"Dubai to London  - I flew  on the A350  for one of  the first trips  and will be flying it again.  During the same  three segment trip I tried SQ  business class and  the business class  ( sadly the  same BA business  class on an  older B777) on overnight trips. The  new ""business suite""  package from BA is the best  economy class I 've experienced. I  am a BA  business card holder  and the experience  is outstanding. The  staff lounge at  BA was very  nice with plenty  of seating and  very good choice  in drinks. Food  choice in the  cabin was limited  and not an  issue On board  the new suite  and very comfortable , I had  two great nights  sleep with the  open door making all the difference  to getting a  good six hours , The bed  was very comfortable.  Lunch choices were  very limited (soup  and sandwiches) although  these did suit the timing of  your flight. I  would say this is an excellent very serious business  suite for night  and business travellers. Whether it works  for leisure travellers who want to  travel rather than  business or daytime travellers I don't  remember but I certainly could work  quite effectively in  the suite. Downside  is the IFE  is still rubbish  on relation to  this rest of the product."
1.0,Flying to New  Jersey via London.  Expect the worst ! We have tried this airline  since the first and definitely last time! They should  go through their  customer service hiring department from scratch!
10.0,"Yesterday my husband and I decided to to come  down from Rome earlier than the  scheduled time at 8pm. When I rang BA in London, the customer  care adviser was  kind and reassuring  and able to  confirm the the  right time to  travel without having to pay extra.  Before the flight, the steward gave  us hot water  and milk so  now I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane, I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so. We have booked our flight  with BA next ! Thank you  are taking good care of us  – just to  express how much  you appreciate your  exceptional service."
1.0,"Flight from London to Athens with British Airways, was  another of the worst experiences. The  super slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the  evening and sadly  your next day as well in . The screens  for flight info have gone, no  screens and airline  has become a bad quality budget airline. Sad. Avoid."
8.0,Short 45 minute flight north and south with British Airways. Lounge at  airport and also NCL was busy but there was no shortage of seats. Gates for  departure and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits. The  seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on  time
6.0,"Flight to Gothenburg  from London with  Swedish Airways. Staff  were very friendly  and helpful. Entertainment  was good. Food  is just ok,  ordering a salmon  burger as a  starter on a  small plane wouldn't  be my first  choice to serve.  Plane seats are  very uncomfortable. Super  cramped to the point that you  sit with your  arms crossed so As to not  scare your neighbours.  On a 9  hour flight this  was painful. Paid  double the extra  hotel room which  felt good but  still one of  THE most uncomfortable long flights have  EVER been on. Recommend for short  trips"
10.0,"for a long time I have avoided taking British  flights due to  their poor past reputation. Yesterday I traveled on BA  flights from Kuala Lumpur to London , I boarded  my flight with  very open mind,  after 12 hours , I disembarked  very very happy  and it is  always good to see an airline  making visible improvements that deliver value  to it’s customers.  The praise is due and I  want to congratulate BA for such a pleasant experience, the flight departed on time and  not half an hour early, the crew was not only professional but they did everything  through a smile  that made passengers  feeling welcomed, the  flight was pristine  and with delightful entertainment content, the  experience was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler. What more can  you say? Enough  can say that I will be  flying with BA …"
8.0,"Paris to London.  A pleasant flight on an ageing ! After the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a  window seat, meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger, she kindly swapped seats so we could be together. For a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you  know you’re in your own little world. A good flight, on time with a nice  meal is as good as you can expect."
7.0,London to Kuala Lumpur. Better than I was expecting after reading the  airline reviews. The seats are great and service was very friendly on  each leg (less so on the return). A few areas need improvement: 1) Separate toilets from economy 2)  The crew for  their premium economy  service rather than added onto their economy service. 3) A better 2nd meal - The main meal was  excellent and noticeably  more premium however the next meal (breakfast) was a bit of an afterthought. Would I  try BA premium  service again : ) Definitely.
1.0,"Only wish I  would give a zero. I was booked on a  route from Newark  via Madrid via  London I come  to find that  your minimum layover time in London is 1 hr.  The flight layover  to London was  with British Airways  insisting that the  landing and departing  time in London  are the same, but that was  a total lie.  The wife and  me were sprinting  through the airport,  but between getting off the aeroplane,  trying to go  through security again,  then having to get to the other side of  the airport for  another connection, we  missed the layover . We had  this same route  on the reverse  and I called  BA hoping to change the return  ticket and explained  the situation. They kept insisting that  because the layover  was a staggering  45 minutes more than London’s minimum 1hr layover threshold  and they were  unwilling to help  in any way.  UK Airways has  so far the  worse customer service  i have ever  experienced Ryanair which  is a no-frills  airline has better  phone service and  it is saying . I will never be flying  them again and  working on converting  this company away from BA flights  very well. Be  warned Stay away  with this carrier  by all costs  and be prepared  to deal with  bad customer service  In case any  issues arise."
5.0,One of the  reasons we traveled  in class was  that BA have  facilities where you  could get away  of the usual  airport chaos and screaming children. BA  will tell you  this is no  seating at Kos her Limited seating.  Very noisy limited . Not sure  I will spend so much on air tickets with them in the  air if they  do warn of  these facilities. It  may help that  the flight is delayed by an  hours
4.0,"Gatwick to Alicante. On my outbound flight (23 Sept) I gave BA almost 10 out of 10 across the board in a review they invited me to complete. On my return flight (26 Sept) it was a different matter. From entering Alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison  bog standard (except the VIP lounge  that was good). Travelling Club Europe  had no advantages. Only one check in open for all passengers, no bag drop facilities, no facility to  buy boarding passes. When invited to board we had to wait 20 minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane. The Iberia factor. Honestly you wouldn't have thought it was the same company. Once on the plane everything went like clockwork."
9.0,"Flying to London.  Excellent flight on  a superb A380;  to my opinion,  The most comfortable  and quiet aircraft  flying at the  time Outstanding in  customer service from  the crew. Attentive,  polite and professional;  The very best  of British Airways service. Food well  within average for  this cabin - though breakfast could have been better.  Overall excellent. The  cockpit is comfortable  in a good  size and supplied  to a decent,  padded cushion and an excellent quilted . Very enjoyable . Highly recommended."
1.0,"Welcome to Alicante.  3 hours (1 ), sitting on  plane with my  head rammed against  wall in front.  Little room to  breathe I have  been on several  occasions on this  plane in last  2 months - Vueling Airlines has  great seats! Stay away from the  windows unless you  are under 5ft ."
10.0,"We have had some torrid experiences with BA -  things we have not been shy to report. So  when we flew  in with them from Heathrow to  Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs  business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful.  Highly efficient and  friendly What more  could you ask?  The food was  really nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot  conceive of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but  again it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of  hospitality on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite ."" Sadly, the  BA CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful.  Hopefully once he  gets on we can expect something better. Although the  aircraft was a  bit delayed on  arrival it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming  security officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars! Surreal, as anyone who regularly travels to the States, will testify!  We felt as  though we were living in the Truman Show at  that point but in the nicest  possible way. Get yourselves down to  big ole Austin  so that BA fly there direct. Fantastic."
8.0,"London Heathrow to Austin with British  Airways It was  the little bit  like going back  to time to fly upper deck  of a 747  to Austin. But, it was the most enjoyable flight we’ve taken for  some long time. It was so  comfortable on our  time and we  have a fantastic flight crew who couldn’t do enough for you, and always with a  laugh We arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in  the air, on  time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The only slight  complaint was the very IFE systems and small overhead  bins But plenty of spare lockers and our iPads took are of that."
1.0,"They did not actually fly because of their pilot strike. This review  happened because of  their poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike. I immediately tried to rebook with the  nearest other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had  bumped their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a  different flight. I then cancelled my  original flight, but they only refunded  some of the  ticket I had . The £28 difference was picking  up seats. How do they consider that not part  if the cost of the flight?  They should have refunded me everything as it was  all my fault  they were striking. I completed their  complaints form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago  I phoned their Customer Service line and the person  i spoke to  claimed he would refund me the £28. I never received the refund. "
7.0,"THE start of  our journey back from from EFL  was inauspicious, with  hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers  crowded into the  departures lounge, awaiting  departure on airlines  other than BA.  As it was, weather in the  UK plus air  pollution control issues  mean that departure was delayed by  45 minutes. Once  seated in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!),  the crew in  line were friendly  but efficient, and the food (including  the cod dish) was quite reasonable.  I was interesting  too note that  the refit hadn't  extended to the  cabin which was  looking distinctly worse  for the wear.  One big plus  on the flight  - and a  plus for me  - was WiFi,  which actually worked  but was quite  fast - although  for a cost of £4.99 for  1 hour's use.  Some thought it  was meant to be free for business class passengers,  although evidently not.  It made up for some time but we were parked right in  The middle of nowhere because of  our backlog of  passengers However, BA  had laid on  a separate bus  with CE passengers  and we were  cleared of the  gate 30 minutes later. So, not  so bad, all  in all."
1.0,"Chicago to Zurich via London. Delays  and delays. The flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 pm (Chicago  time but was  cancelled at 9:40 , we waited a long time at the airport.  Then at 10 pm we managed to board on  our A380 for  our first time  but the legroom  was horrible. The IFE completely unfunctional and with no food served. During the taxi, a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate.  At the end, the plane took off at 12 am Chicago time and we arrived in London Heathrow at 2 pm. We had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight. We arrived in Zurich on an old A319 at 9:30 pm Zurich time  ahead of the original 3:30 pm. Very stressful at least the staff  is nice."
9.0,"Welcome to London.  Nice flight, departure/arrival  any time. Boarding  was quick, the seat was ok.  Since I had  ordered a vegetarian  so the caterer  never provided any  food they said)  - but the  first attendant quickly  resolved the issue.  My food was  great and the  service (french, Bourgogne)  was surprisingly good.  Flight attendant was  extremely polite and  attention to detail.  all in all,  a great flight."
9.0,"We booked this  flight a week before the BA  flight and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would  work The check-in and security clearance  at T5 took only 15 minutes.  Personally I do not like the  quick service bag and tag drop  which BA operate as one is  always 100% confident that I did  it correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to  4 which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not  the fan of  the Possibly due to the previous day's strike and  their need to  refund passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a  Airbus A321. Boarding was however smooth.  On board the  BA full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient  leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat  in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin)  who were very  accommodating and friendly  and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves  as a full  price airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a  great flight and the value was very good as  it was combined  for a hotel booking. Tegel itself  is a bit  more hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait  with luggage but this was not BA's fault."
1.0,"I wouldn't even  rate them 1/10 2 x business  Class passengers booked via On Business. 1 bag lost in transit. Ground  agent in MXP rude, dismissive & most unhelpful, unable  the locate missing bag. Waited for next flight to  arrive still no bag. Decided to  call short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok  - a lesson learnt the hard way. Due to  it being an  early booking BA customer services unwilling  not be flexible  & change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return. Apparently the bag arrived  weeks later, we were back in  London UK, despite  BA website showing in transit LHR/MXP  for 8 days! Numerous lengthy calls to customer service , fruitless, passed from one department to another then  turned off! After  one email to their CEO & Director of Brand  and Customer Experience received a call from Global Engagement  Support Team offering  an e-voucher. Abysmal  airline services. No wonder their reputation is in tatters. I will never fly BA again."
3.0,"Compare London City , Geneva. The  biggest plus was the Embraer E190  that had a  luxurious interior with plenty of leg room for an  economy seat. Other  then that BA  also offers a  very no frills service that is  very different to  a budget airline. Yet it charges  premium service' prices!"
4.0,"Los Angeles to Istanbul via London. Flight between London  to Istanbul is like coach, no TV and small leg room. Transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not  have a complete bed. Food was below average. The  Istanbul BA business lounge was a cramped, tasteless, dirty  space . It took us 25  minutes to find two chairs to  sit Food was  equally awful and  alcohol is even worst. When we  decided to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of $500 plus fee change, so we ended  up paying $800 per person in addition to the fare already paid. "
5.0,Back to Tel  Aviv via London.  To return from  Phoenix to Phoenix  was a nightmare. I want everyone to know that  we sent a  request 3 times  and there is  only one to  reply to. This  was not something  which I am  entitled to.
5.0,"On to Kefalonia : The T5 Galleries lounge is  showing its age and was packed  by 9:30 on  the Saturday. Boarding  followed by the  usual standard groups,  that meant waiting 15 minutes in a queue and  another 10 minutes  crossing the bridge.  The flight deck then informed us , we’d be  sitting on a  runway for 1 hr 20 minutes  until our departure . Once in  thin air, cabin  attendants delivered the  usual Club Europe experience, which was  average at best.  My arrival was  approximately 45 minutes late and we  pulled out of Kefalonia airport 30  minutes later. Overall,  your typical BA  fare that’s lacklustre  and best."
1.0,"London to Dublin. It was never  a choice to  fly with British Airways and I  will never fly  on them again.  It was supposed  my fly with American Airlines from the USA to  Chicago but I  needed a connecting flight from my origin city to . Unfortunately, my  scheduled flight was delayed due to  snow which caused me to miss  my flight from  Boston to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had  a run for  until I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with  American Airways from  Boston to Dublin. I was told to file a  provisional baggage claim  at BA, which I did. I was told that  this bag would be transferred from American to BA  after it arrived  at Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm  with the bag  on the day . I did  at noon on  Sunday I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my  possession BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I 'm going to  fight it! My  luggage has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more  than a day  because I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the  agent did everything she could to find out the  whereabouts of my  luggage And even  though their baggage claim desk was  there when I  called she still  wanted to call an internal number  and see if  I was still  there Unfortunately she  could get hold  to anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly  who I could call and when to call them  again next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was  informed “we are  NOT authorized to  call airports.” Why  on the world  must they be authorized to call  their own baggage department? I am  not thrilled with  the airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has  ruined the first  three days of a trip that I planned for  many years. If you do check a bag and  its lost or delayed, don’t expect  much help if you flew with BA. And here’s  my tip: if  you are dealing  w a lost or delayed bag  in a country you don’t live , don’t call the generic customer  assistance number on the website you <mask> normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a <mask> for the airport you flew <mask> You will get a lot more information and assistance that way. <mask>"
1.0,"HK Kong to  London An email  on the 25th  hour advising us  how this flight  is cancelled and  3 hours spent  on hold never  talking to anyone,  was a total  travel nightmare. Then  an email at 6.00pm saying I  would be delighted  to find out  the flight has  also been cancelled.  The slots in  an Elemis Salon  were already booked  but no massages  being available in  Economy Class. Arriving  in HK airport  on the return  plane and struggling  hard to get  off the pavement  from the inside  of the terminal , did they  never tell us  they print out  dates of travel??).  I had to  queue ages for  them to open  and check in , pretty average  staff and service  in the Qantas . A broken  screw in seat  8 (it would not stay in position and without  being unusable to  prevent interruptions during  this flight to  his partner from  a large passenger  flying over him. A ghastly sweet  / sour chicken  of course which  made me send  a tray away  or not eat  it after leaving  my flight. Cheapest  checked bag with  one broken zip  from my suitcase  and the very  bottom off the  plane I had  not been to  the BA desk  and reported it  but it then  never turned up  on the conveyor  belts First class  flying to HK  had a good  business class experience,  but return flight  was business class  was in a  very poor. The  flight was tired,  equipment faulty, poor , and the  service was only  worse by the  size of the  flight they were  on - but  if you give  the rubbish tools they will serve !! The night  shift pantry offering  in a total  joke I have  as a BA  debit card holder  but for ever , I have  experienced is a decline in the  service level. Certainly  good value for  money we did  indeed get a Club class experience  on the flight !"
1.0,"On to Seville. When my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of  staff insisted in making them pay 50GBP because one of the suitcases  looked 4cm oversize, and he insisted that it was not a hand . Staff said that if he  would not pay, he would lose the flight."
5.0,"Flight to Abuja-flight full, aircraft an  older version of 777-200. Evening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more  than less on  schedule after dodging thunderstorms near Abuja. Return flight delayed - pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at Lagos -  and had to  get flown back to Abuja with a 2 hour  delay Flight was supposed to be  at 8 am  onwards but the airport side did not have the sense to tell  us so we were herded into  the gate area  as there was  no food facility and waited for  the flight. The crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and  that same plane - they had also had to have a long  airport wait but were quite chatty  as we were  all in the  passenger boat. Flight totally full as flights on previous  days had been ! Breakfast was served but there was no evidence  for the standard  of meals being improved-scrambled egg was just a lump  of tasteless yellow. Full credit to the crew -  fast and efficient in spite of  having the delays . The aircraft  looked clean but  dusty and down  to heel - the carpet under the seat in front was ripped  and the ""floor""  was visible."
4.0,Welcome to Bangkok.  What an awful  experience Seats are just about OK ! Coming back it seemed like  the bar going across the bottom back part of the seat. Really uncomfortable. The meals  look fine but  then the last  one is served  for over an hour before landing and rushed. The main problem is  watching entertainment on a small scratched screen and about  10 films. Rubbish.  About 2 hours to get the  system to actually work. The plane looks old and  tired Not a  pleasure to travel on this plane.
10.0,"Belfast to San Francisco via London.  Entry at Belfast City was fast  & trouble free  and security was  over with-in just  another few minutes  with no queues  for mention. Boarding  started direct from  The Business Lounge  and on time  as was departure.  A full breakfast  buffet was carried  onboard including hot  or hot breakfast,  fruit and coffee along with drinks  from the bar  upon request. The  Business Lounge in  Lounge 5 at  departure was very  quiet with limited  drinks available. Boarding  on the second  flight began on  arrival and departure ! The inflight  experience was top notch with a  highly capable crew  looking after the  passengers on the  upper deck in  a professional and  friendly manner. Food  was plentiful and  the entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fine. No  problems at all  on the flight  I would recommend  Irish Airways."
9.0,"Welcome to Gothenburg.  They are getting  a lot of bad press -  more so at  BA with strikes,  computer glitches, baggage problems. However extreme  issues will always  remain highlighted. Two  last flights on BA, and very  impressed with them. Flight to Gothenburg  on A319-100, pushed  about 25m late  owing to a  minor technical issue,  quickly resolved and  arrived at GOT G 15m behind , Good crew , the Safety  check video was  a hoot. Return  from LHR on  time On time  - and early  departure at T5.  Really good crew.  Could be flying  on BA again  in December (strikes ) Still recommended  for me as  the National Carrier."
1.0,"Back to Gatwick.  Poor flight experience,  no bugs in old Club world , missed meals,  terrible service. Complaints  being outsourced to  a German company  and aren't even  members of BA!  Do not  trust BA and  the world is  a waste of  $$"
3.0,"Mahe to Stockholm  via London. Checked in online before the flight but had to do  a bag drop.  was met by  very rude lady at First class  checking in and the process took about 20 minutes,  not know why, no apology. The  flight was in time. The welcome wasn’t especially friendly,  just pointing the direction where to go. The club Europe cabin felt claustrophobic, I had a window seat. The CSM never came to say . The service  seemed pretty basic, ok during the meals but self service between. No drink service if you didn’t ask. On the flight to Stockholm the  manager introduced himself to all emerald members. The service was limited due  to the strike  the day but friendly. The seating  is terrible on  the A320, so …"
8.0,"Glasgow to Tampa via Gatwick. Early  evening flight Glasgow to Gatwick. Flight dud take off at 6.45. Boarded with doors closed by 6.30 bug  could not depart till 7.10 due to Gatwick being busy, smooth flight down. Gatwick to  Orlando according to manage my booking, aircraft changed 2  minutes prior to departure. At boarding was told our World Traveller plus seats had been upgraded to Club World, a very pleasant surprise. If was on 777 which had not been refurbished, extra space was very good, staff were  really efficient and pleasant. Only downside was the main meal, which I would have had in original seats, but main courses were not to my liking, but  my tea was very good. So thank you BA for the experience."
2.0,"Back to Gatwick.  Getting home was extremely disappointing. The  flight was dirty - drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt. The aircraft aisle was so narrow  you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers. The  cabin had a  flush toilet and lights that could not be turned off, so for  a night flight part of the  cabin was illuminated which made sleep  worse The breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant  and tasted revolting and a highly  caloric cereal bar. Only one drinks run was made.  The standards on  flights have plummeted since we last  used them seven years ago, such a shame. I hope management are  better at reviews  just as this, to improve service."
8.0,"London to Abu Dhabi. This is  a daytime flight from London. A very good flight. The food was excellent for economy (particularly in view of Etihad‘s disastrous  record in food service). The children’s meals were excellent.  Our entertainment system  was great with  a good selection.  It makes a big difference having  the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate, especially when  traveling with children  ( why don’t you do this?). The cabin crew  was good. Economy  of the 787  is cramped but probably no worse  for many. Good value flight, especially as the only  major carrier to Abu Dhabi is  Qatar"
2.0,"London to St  Andrews Huge disappointment  with BA business class service in  both routes. Seat  height has been reduced to 30""  for the last  flight (from 34"")  with the expense of passenger comfort. Seat width is the same as economy with empty  economy seat. Food  serving me was half-empty plates representing  a deli experience,  not leaving me ! Out of  the three options offered, two were  sold out of  order so stranded  with the least  attractive and most  affordable food option.  Country Club Europe, not worth the  risk"
4.0,"Sydney to London via Singapore with British Airways. I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this  trip - the  meal was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be  slightly overcooked potatoes (and maybe other  vegetables I am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold  steak which should clearly have been heated up. The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat  was nothing to  shout home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared  toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights. Paid for in-flight wifi for  about a hour - disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use. Reasonable price and speed."
2.0,"Back to Johannesburg.  British Airways is  one of the few commercial carriers  in the world that charges an  outrageous amount in fees when booking . But in addition, if you want to ensure  your and your spouse will sit  together on the  trip you need  to pay a  fair price to  change seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on  flights to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31.  So that's the  flight called for ? Only we made our reservations  before those dates  are set. Considering  that pilots have  plans for three  scheduled strikes on  March 2019, coupled  with Brexit, we  needed to change  this flight plan  since we did not want to  risk missing our connection. The good  thing is close to $800 in  fee for our two Business Class  seats was refunded  when I changed  our flights to  a carrier through  BA Airlines Advantage.  My bad news  was the $220.00  I had to pay to reserve our seats was  not refunded. I called BA to  request a refund  and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat  reservation expenses. I  could just not  worth the love ! So I 'm writing this  review to warn  anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All  the the other  major carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge  for reserving your seats in advance.  Speaking of BA, we changed our  tickets to 10/30  on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi.  The customer service  remained outstanding. The  fares were lower and yes, no  need to have  the peace of  mind that my  spouse and I  would travel next  to each other.  We am entering  January in September  2020 because there  is no other  plans for future . This request for a refund  is two months in advance of our planned flight.  This is an  airline policy review  which lets the buyer beware."
2.0,"I have to say travelling in Club Europe is  total waste of money. The food was no better  then economy food  from the past.  Your seats are  not the same  as in economy although you get a middle tray, and probably worst of all the  plane was full  of a lot  of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow  make them more worthy people. This might be a  common trait as I’ve travelled business  style on other airlines and not had the same experience."
10.0,"I had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from Chennai to London by British airways. The Chennai  Airport Service Manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley, screening the luggage, checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person. I am stunned by the  response and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect  and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth. Thank you so much. Inside the aircraft the crew members did come  out and asked if I need any help, and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard. I did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at Heathrow airport. Over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has  been really smooth with BA and Heathrow airport. #happyautism# Thank you"
10.0,Edinburgh to Kuala  KL via London.  I have just  returned to KL  from an extended  family in UK  with family and  colleagues My return flight was BA033 from Heathrow to  Mal Lumpur on Monday 26th August 2019 at 21.10.  I was greeted  as the most  beautiful air hostess 's name I  cannot quite catch.  One point I wish to make is that she looked after me  so well on the flight. She  was exceptional. It really made the  flight one of the best on board experiences I 've had. 
1.0,"I was supposed  a fly from London City to Amsterdam on 24/7, Business Class. Once  in LCY, my early pm flight appeared as cancelled. A state of  panic broke out at the airport,  leaving people trying to find alternatives, however I managed to be rebooked on a later flight. On a  particular day, I waited for hours at the airport. The new flight  had displayed as “delayed” for 45mins. the delay kept on increasing, with  my flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm. I  kept on waiting.  The flight eventually  turned up cancelled as well. Result:  Quite a day  spent at LCY. I feel that  overall punctuality and  level of customer service have been declining significantly lately. Delays and cancellations  will happen, however  flights have been  flying BA +/- 30 times a  day and the  amount of flights delayed has been  extremely high lately,  particularly to/from Amsterdam and Germany. Also, the customer service  appears to have a “minimum care” proposition (provide what  is strictly required  under the law,  and if customers complain, taking as long as possible), that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer,  unless you are a frequent flyer or not."
1.0,"I purchased a  seat for Dublin  to Mauritius on British Airways for  22 Feb 2019.  During the day  before travel, a few hours before the departure time, I realized that  I would not  been able to make it and  therefore I got  into touch with  UK Airways on  Skype advising them of my cancellation. When I arrived  there I asked  management to officially cancel my ticket and issue me  my refund. I  knew that my  ticket was a  good one, but  it says on  their ticket that surcharges, taxes and  other fees would  remain refundable which should have amounted  to at least  500 euro. However,  what the airline  had refunded me was a pitiful  3 euro. I  had been trying  the speak to British Airways on Twitter many times  for the past  several months, and  have never responded  – only insisting  the they were  doing the right  thing and that  their position would not change. British Airways is being  dishonest and should  been avoided."
9.0,"London to Shanghai. The Concorde room  in Heathrow Terminal 5 was amazing, the dinner experience was great and the food was  excellent However, the  wine galleries was  slow and the buffet was bad.  Inside the plane,  cabin crew was  very friendly and nice. Dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off, the food  is okay. Bed  is made after  landing and it was very comfortable,  possibly the best I have had.  My entertainment system  is not as  advanced as other airlines like Qatar  Air and Emirates. Overall, the journey was great."
2.0,"I have often flown British Airways and have considered  this a good airline. However, their  phone service has fallen to such a level that  I must say it is terrible.  If you have  no problems this  is a good airline. If you  experience any problems  I will not  feel able to get any help. I recently flew to London from Chicago. They erroneously  assigned my seats although I had  flown in over  12 hours before  the flight. They  immediately downgraded my  seat and put me on the plane. They then lost my luggage  for 15 days.  These things happen but customer service was impossible to use. When you  ask you almost  immediately get a  reply that says  you are busy  or the phone  then hangs up. If you send in a request  to help via  their website you will get only  a robo generated message that they will get back to you. They  did not. You can't find out  a status of  an inquiry and  will get a looping set of  automated messages. Do not take this  airline if customer  service may be important to you."
10.0,"good morning. I would like to  write a review for British Airways. It took me a while to write this review as I it took me a while to get  through what happened to me. But  we feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my  18 year old son and my  17 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby  came while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions.  However I tried  to make the  holiday a positive experience for my son and friend  and carried on, all the while  still wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for  that When I realised I was in a complete  mess I had  a break down. I rang BA  and sobbed down  that phone. They 're beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra  flights We all  travelled together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day . Customer service  was outstanding. So  friendly and helpful. And again they  do not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for  this help. I  will only ever fly BA on long haul if possible."
1.0,"This flight was  delayed 3 days  in a row. Was flying out  last Thursday and  then after days , hours of  negotiations with BA,  we got a  ticket out Saturday  night with Swiss ! They on  on other hand  cannot fly and  have time. Everything  from the customer  and customer relations  have been terrible,  days of waiting  by the phone,  getting answers on . My other  trip with BA  this year has  got delayed too.  They have for two months promised  the reimburse me  with all my  charges and to  clear the penalty  amount of 700$.  After 10 days,  over 21 bank  statements and now we are way  over anything else , they have  never transferred the  money yet. So  still nothing and  the complaint has  not turned over  by CAA and  to Danish Aviation ."
2.0,"King Kong to  Sweden via London.  This whole experience  is a nightmare  for me and my wife. My wife lost her  job ever since  the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two  bags of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by  airline staff when  I took the transit flight from  London UK to Copenhagen. We went  to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor.  We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house  at Marstal in CPH on or  around 3rd August or deliver to  a hotel we stayed in CPH  if they were  left on 4th August. On 2nd  August we found that the updated  status of our  checked luggage in  the BA website showed that one  was our luggage  got found while  another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept  calling and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage  at our house  when they failed  not do so.  Also the website status showed that  we chose to pick up the  luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the  date on the  website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery  date to 3th August 2020 instead  of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff  also failed to  send the luggage to us so  I told them  and decided to  pick them up  in the airport.  So when we  got to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had  not sent the  other luggage to the island in  London on 4th.  But they did not follow our  request and sent  us to the wrong place on the wrong date.  We then asked us to find  our other luggage that had been  left with a  potential match randomly  in the trolleys  in their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had  be sent to the island but they insisted that  that was the possible match one! They were so  angry and even  wanted us to  return to the  airport to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe , the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still  there but the  airline messed it . We were  very confused which bag was really missing. We finally  decided to ask  someone to deliver the luggage in  full to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to  the hotel in  late evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out <mask> our luggage in Marstal had <mask> sent back <mask> the airport at 8 pm <mask> the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it <mask> by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the <mask> However, when we came to the airport again, <mask> couldn't find <mask> luggage and the staff didn't explain why and <mask> told us <mask> leave. If <mask> luggage was <mask> it to <mask> airport on the 4th, how <mask> it would disappear on the 5th? The staff <mask> kept saying <mask> they were busy and that no one had time to look <mask> the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at <mask> airport and <mask> that we got nothing! You can't imagine how <mask> and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting <mask> Now that <mask> staff asked <mask> to pressure <mask> to in <mask> pressure them to locate our <mask> That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure <mask> you could <mask> something about <mask> My wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip."
6.0,London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. This was  another very similar  experience outbound and  as I am  on the plane  was the same.  i am a gold card holder and until this  point have always  flown BA. I  am seriously considering not doing this ! The 777-200  I flew in  DC was dirty and old. I flew my family of 5 business  class but 2 of the 5 seats did not  fit - no  power socket jack  that operated. The  others were from the ark. Crew as always excellent . BA should be ashamed that  I charge business class rates for  the experience. I  were told by  flight crew that they would contact  them to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last  time flying into DC from London  but the seat  would not recline  even with a manual adjuster. That  and at least we received AVIOS.  BA customer service  seems increasingly low  quality in feel.
5.0,"Inflight crew were  very helpful, polite and caring. Though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to  other airlines, it  is quite pleasant.  However food and drink selection was  fairly basic. However  the ground staff especially at the  check in counter in DXB and  lose & found  on London heathrow  was rude and very unhelpful. I forgot to collect my suit which  i had handed to crew member  around the time of boarding. Upon  calling the BA  airport the personnel  were not willing  to help or  make a lost and found complain.  – Neither any  understanding nor any willingness to help."
10.0,"From Toronto to Pisa British Airways used a wet  day Air Belgium  Airlines Crew on  board very friendly  and helpful but  many times struggled to provide full  customer service speedily.  Service was excellent.  Business Class cabin . Weather related  problems and blocked  departure gate resulted in short connection time at LHR.  With our great  efforts British Airways  arranged for us at the exit of the plane  then drove our family (7 people  ages from 3  ages 62 years)  through Terminal 5 to Terminal 3, escorted us through  customs and brought  us to and  safely through our  departure gate and onto our flight to Pisa. Without this transfer help we would have  lost our connection. Flight to Pisa  good time, good  on good on  board catering, arrived 15 minutes before the time."
9.0,"A very good  experience on board this flight with  Republic Airways from  Amsterdam to VCE. Although the flight was about 30  seconds delayed due  of an aircraft  change from an Airbus A319 to and Airbus A320,  they arrived only  slightly behind the  expected arrival time.  the crew were  helpful and informative and the plane  was very clean , because the  plane was relatively  flat The seat  was not too  uncomfortable either with  the good leg  seat One small issue that I  would raise is that there was  no complimentary food and beverage on board, you had  to pay or  take Avios (it isn't that bad  if it was  coming to Europe). An overall very good experience on board this flight."
1.0,"It was the worst experience I have ever had ! There was  no time in  London to transfer our bags from American Airlines. AA verified that they delivered the bags to BA but  they were not on our flight  that we reached  Newark The bags did not arrive  so we spent two days in London without our bags. I left  our earphone hard case on the  flight but your Lost and Found  never answered to file a claim.  Your website was horrible to use to file this claim and I  still heard nothing.  In the return flight from London to Newark, your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced  the lock. With  another experience like this on our  summer vacation to  Europe I would  drop everything to never fly British Airways again."
3.0,"London to Larnaca. New A321neo, 4.5  hours flight. The  plane was narrow, the food simple nothing worth spending my money. The staff was friendly  but spending money  for a 5  hours flight on such a small  aircraft doesn't worth  it No entertainment . It is  very small plane  for this duration. "
10.0,Gatwick to Orlando.  Great customer service. On arriving at  JFK airport and  checked in I learn that my interpretation of the  BA esta rules was wrong and that I would have to apply  to a new esta valid for the duration of my trip. This took longer than it should have and BA kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found Me  in the terminal and got our bags checked in  and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft. The aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time. During  my flight drinks were served and two food services.  Near the end of the flight  i developed a  severe nose bleed  The stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring. So despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger BA really came through  for me. The return journey went  without a hitch and BA's check in at Orlando was quick and easy.
6.0,Flying to Munich. The plane is : The seat is more comfortable  that other airlines . It has a very comfortable headrest and it  is made from leather. There is  ample legroom. However there is no free food and  beverage provided.
1.0,"Thanks to Glasgow. BA customer service  are unquestionably the  least helpful, least  efficient least friendly and least responsive  so called service available. They clearly  educate their staff  in the multitude of ways to  help their customers.  We will try to avoid this  company from this point on. "
1.0,"The seating configuration meant that we were packed in like sardines. The  planes are aging , uncomfortable. The forward-backward configuration is  THE most stupid I have seen.  The cabin had  three seats to  each row and  over 100 people  packed into a  crowded and noisy  space To book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck  several hours ahead of the flight. </s>"
10.0,"No problems at  Manchester airport in  Manchester it was  easy to find  the British Airways  check in desk.  My flight was  on time. The  cabin crew was  really kind and  the flight was  very pleasant. I also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread,  but it was  very delicious. The  biggest problem was  in Heathrow, because  a gate bridge  experienced a malfunction,  meaning we had  to wait for about an hour  in the aircraft.  Perhaps it is  only an airliner ? After all  we enjoyed the  trip with British ."
2.0,Malaga to London Heathrow . A shambolic airline. Rude and incompetent Iberia ground staff in Malaga. BA sent  photos of the 2 hour delay just before the  actual boarding began - sophisticated IT  skills they have!  BA Europe meal  was a big cutback from 2017 despite what BA claim. Cabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in Club cabin the service was very poor. Arrived Heathrow at 23.45 and then sat waiting 10 mins for ground staff to show up.  A Simply appalling trip and truly  turned off.
2.0,"Hello to Singapore. Extremely disappointed trip.  We are unable  to even track  our checked baggage , we found  it was missing  on the baggage carousel. Our baggage  should have been  appropriately handled as we were at  business class but what happened was  we can’t even  remember if the  luggage was loaded  or not at  all Many important things are in the checked baggage  which we’ll have  to trip later , which affected  it badly. No  response so far  and the hotline  we provided is  not engaged"
1.0,"From Heathrow to  Manchester Having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with  flying so far this summer, I felt the need  to update with  my new review as the final  flight home I  had rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which I  was to wait over a day for - was  suddenly  cancelled  due to a  misunderstanding with the  airline We were  stuck on the plane for over  an hour whilst  the crew were waiting to hear  from ground crew  what was happening  and where to  get Eventually got  on the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by  the crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others  given nothing. Some  others were sent  emails with rebooking options, others (including  me received nothing.  Being handed out  complimentary hotel accommodation and shuttle bus  into and from the hotels - however some people  were only given  one bus voucher, meaning they had  the means to  get to the airport the next  morning Some people  booked on a flight in two days time and  realised they’d have  a return to  the airport the  following morning anyway  or get any  more refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Utterly appalling. Now I’m  up against hope I might make  It home today,  four days after setting off!"
2.0,Heathrow to Glasgow.  This flight is  free It’s easier to use the  airport than fly with BA the  pilots don’t even get embarrassed anymore  they stand smiling offering apologies to  our tired and weary customers. Trouble  being there is  that other operators  making it a  choice of take  off or leave ? Very tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible  experience
1.0,"A supremely awful  experience from beginning  and end. Flight  from Vancouver delayed  over 4 hours  thanks to a  software defect that  was been resolved  on previous day  but somehow no  attempt made to  pick up the  time in between. Only told once  in board what  the problem was.  Problems at baggage  check meant I didn’t get out  of Vancouver airport  until after midnight  ( scheduled to  be 6.55pm). This affected a camping  party the booking for which could  never be changed.  Flight home marred by massive queues  for baggage check  out and on  the plane, due  to IT faults, none of which  got communicated until  they were seated  on the plane  were told they  would not leave  the passenger information  would get through  with the crew.  Due to more  technical faults the  flight entertainment was  NOT working so  impossible to watch  for the 9 pm flight. Food  tasted awful and  barely got a  bit of one . Spent hours  on Heathrow airport  planning my flight home to Inverness  only to be  informed by text  an hour before  landing that it  is cancelled. Queued  3 hours to  receive some information from someone. They  got me on  a flight for  4 hours later  after checking this  was ok -  I discovered it  happened over a  day later when  I was handed  my boarding pass.  That means I’ve  cancelled a trip  for friends to  the Edinburgh festival.  Had to source  my own hotel  for food etc  to reclaim on  arrival - a  load of money  drained out of  an account whilst  I wait for  refunds Now I’m  told my rebooked  flight is already  gone and was  told by customer  service that there’s  little telling whether  the bags will  be with me . I have  a wait at  baggage reclaim and  then If they  are not on  that flight I  get no information  relating to when  they can expect  or have my  luggage back with  me These are  not the most  obvious issues, there  is more and I’m really shocked  about what a  really terrible service  have been provided. Between this, massive  concern for data breaches and the  fact that BA  appear to have  had consistent and  clear issues with  customers it is beyond my comprehension  how they can  still be in ."
1.0,European Airways flight  from Brussels from  London Check in problems and a  slightly delayed flight. Pay premium prices  and a below  average service. They  need to invest  into their IT systems and greatly  up their game.
1.0,"On to Nice. I agree totally  with the comments  contained in Michael 's review today.  My flight to  London was cancelled , a result  from the low-cost , unreliable IT  systems that BA  employs while the  senior management are  off celebrating somewhere , they managed  the cut more costs. The handling  of the situation at Heathrow was  poor and you 'd think that  given all the  people that BA  have these days,  it would have  kept this part  of their act ! They make out such a  situation is a  gift from the  past when clearly  they have not  started investing where  you should, instead  focusing on cost  cuts to boost  the performance bonuses.  Maybe just the  CEO should go, but some others  from the top."
1.0,"Palma to London : How does British Airways get away with having  such a useless IT system and presumably team of  useless staff /  employees These issues recur on such  a frequent basis it is now time for some  blame to roll, preferably from the CEO down. Just read a fatuously  funny interview with  Alex Cruz talking  about how his children are guiding him on the  future of air  travel when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in  theory - let alone try to  make himself look  more eco-friendly with such comments. I have been a  regular customer for  over 48 years,  and it seems that BA have not the slightest interest in those of us that  paid full fares and have been  through all the  perks of BA without complaint until now. My patience  have run out. </s>"
1.0,"Kansas City to  Manchester Disappointing. All  the flights were cancelled without explanation  - presumably because  no striking staff  didnt turn up,  the trip was  ruined Got a replacement ticket for  the different destination  on a different week.

1.0,"On to Faro. We booked our  seats (family of  6 two months  before the flight  with British Airways  so we could  check the quality  and the service (so we thought). Inbound flight seats has been booked , paid (quite high amount for 7 seats) for  both row 2  or 3. Outbound  flight row 6  and 7. Two  hours before the flight without any  call and email  from British Airways  we found out  - our seats has been moved  in ""unlucky"" 13  seats and to  seat 8 outbound.  The split all  seats quite far  and apart from  one other as well. Customer Service has hang up  with us for  their first time,  the second phone  call has promised  to call back  but never did.  Did I ever  did pay (£2000 ) so I  will have ""Good  customer Service with British Airways ever  since - the  option is no , I am extremely upset (that  our seats has  been given away  for someone else  with no reason),  cancelled and you  can no longer  fly on British  Airways"
3.0,"Flight to London.  They were not  of high standards.  They rushed and  very polite, did not look professional . In our  case back to London staff were  aggressive and just  talking very loudly in back of  the aircraft. There  was not welcome . We sat  at the very  last row and  the choice ended.  Eating chicken was our option to  go Very sad and staff did  not care about  our situation."
8.0,"London Heathrow to Sofia. We checked  in online, so we went straight to baggage drop. It was quick and worked well, our bag was 25 kg, maximum is 23 kg, so we had to take 2 kg out. After that, we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags, show our passport and then go through to security. My daughter was beeped, but it wasn't a big deal. It was fast, and our flight was departing in 1h 30m. We got some drinks, and then we noticed our gate was announced early. We headed to the gate and boarding began about 20m later. Boarding was fast, and we were sitting in seats 33 DEF. The seats were comfortable, leather and had headrests. A321 so there was no IFE. We had a 1 hour delay from the bad airspace, but eventually took off. Our route was a little different, instead of going  to France, Switzerland, etc, we went over Germany, Hungary, etc. The food was good and wasn't too expensive.  I didn't buy anything really, just food. While coming into Bulgaria, the views were nice. The landing was pretty good, despite the bump. Eventually we got off 1 hour late, and we went home. The verdict  was that British Airways are pretty good, despite the delay."
1.0,"Welcome to Kuwait via London. My  arrival from Nice  were delayed in  the plane for 2 hours and  then delayed in  another for 5  hours When we  first left the plane, there were  some information on  where I get  a connecting flight  and due to  that delay I had to miss . Then I  tried to pass through immigration which lasted for 2 hours. There was  no one at  the desk just a piece of  cardboard with a  sign that says  make complaints call ? Now it  is 3am with no one to  complain too and  we still don't  see my bags.  I had to  take a taxi  to sleep (BA didn't not provide  any hotel stay). I I then  needed to leave  the apartment at 7 am to get to the  next flight with Kuwait Airways."
9.0,Los Aires to  the Heathrow. My wife and I  arrived back from  Italy on my  anniversary and the  journey was made  pleasant by an  amazing hostess (Amelia)  who gave great service to everyone with her friendly  helpful manner. On  found out it  being my birthday she came back  bearing a complimentary  cake and personal birthday card. The trip itself left on time and arrived in London . The aircraft  looked quite old  so we found  the seats relatively . The entertainment  was below standard  for the size of the screen .
6.0,"Hong Kong to  London Heathrow, this  is a long haul flight operated  on Boeing 777-300ER.  The seat especially  with headrest is quite comfortable. The  seat is large but there is a little metal  panel under the seat. This negatively  impacts the legroom.  The films provided  are not that  good but I can see the flight path through the personal television.  They provide dinner  or breakfast for  us It is  quite abundant but  not very delicious."
3.0,"what happened to  a great airline?  Went to Heathrow  4 hours before  flight and start  boarding and at  that point there  were only 2 operators and then  after 15 minutes  the 3rd appeared.  15 minutes later  another BA guy  asked for Vegas  flight and then  tells us to  walk toba different  airport to rush  bags through. There  was 1 operator  on this line  but it took  about 20 minutes?  Well over 1  bag on the  flight as we  had missed our  flight due to  delayed boarding. Got  into Las Vegas  and waited at  luggage claim for  over 40 minutes,  missing bag. Got  at BA desk , be told  I missed plane  and there should a been 2 members of staff  on bag claim  and tell us.  No apology just  the shrug of  shoulder During day  long offers from  airlines to upgrade  to Club class , I try  At least 10  hours to book  but website does  the process. Speak  to BA at  first offer to  Be told offer  failed despite the  best advertising, get  speak to Manager , admits the  airlines website is  at worst and  offer to keep  it Book in  advance for return  and web accepts the 2 bags  found on web  has 0 bags.  Called BA and  they say go  into airport and  talk to a  couple of staff.  At Vegas 3  hours early to  make sure plenty  enough time to  book and find  that there are  no BA staff  available in the whole airport until  2 hours before  flight What a  horrible organisation. I  found state staff  missed plane very  early"
2.0,"Flying Heathrow to Malaga in business  class Full and very large Club  Economy cabin on  a morning flight.  Sitting in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a  reason or reason  as to why. On boarding, 2  BA staff by entrance stood chatting  to themselves and totally ignored customers ; not a  great start. Usual  cabin service except the staff were not the slightest ly interested in customer service and  whoever paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money.  The breakfast standards  (& English) are about the same  to a charter flight standard, and  from what BA  are about, this has gone through  at considerable cost ! BA can perform well on  a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are  they preparing to  going on strike  or well since  this is the attitude they displayed.  Some cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic  speakers in front, which was a shocker."
5.0,"I was flying  home to Delhi in economy because my original flight with Swissair was cancelled. The 777 aircraft is looking old, the economy  economy seat is small and fairly cramped, the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens  and are OK, the music selection is dire and  make sure you bring your own  noise cancelling headphone) and the food is just OK. The flight did pretty much leave  India arrive on  Sunday (allowing for the rerouting around Pakistani airspace). "
6.0,"Seattle to Durban via London. On 24th of July i arrived late just before departure time 1330hrs, the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel. The British airways ladies who checked me advised me to  hurry because the plane was about to depart. I  ran through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents. When i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked  my to go up with them  to the plane because it was  time to leave, i panicked and  both assured me that i will get my back pack in Durban. As i sat down in the plane another British airways hostess came and reassured me that i will  get all my bags in Durban.  After my arrival in Durban i got all my  documents including my back pack! I would like to say thank you to the British Airways staff especially  the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in. Its a pity i didn't get their  luggage i was panicky. Thank you so much!"
2.0,"London Heathrow to Austin. 10 hour flight in a  cramped 747-400. Noisy  and tiny screens, collapsing headrest, chocolate  in my seat. Selection of just a half dozen  drinks and no . Poor food  service choices running  low"
1.0,"Paris to London flight delayed and waiting to depart. They are not on time, be prepared to miss  your connections, take  flight 2 hours late,. The staff is some of  my worst I  ever had on . You may be stuck on  the runway and they won’t offer you any water.  The worst business class experience I have had. </s>"
8.0,"Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from  a normal British  Virgin flight in . Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the  flight the guy at the counter  did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal  is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was  no full english  on offer unlike  the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial  variety of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a  drinks counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol.  Quite impressive for  any domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was  very orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to  book an extra  economy seat to  take row 6,  where there is  always tons of  space in front.  They reserved an exit row and  paid an extra £7 per exit  seat during the  boarding These seats  look old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat  options on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had  also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a  small middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a  delicious breakfast with either a bacon,  cheese and scrambled egg option or  the omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour  trip is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite . The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days.  Prices were quite  busy but understandable due to the  short flight time. In Cape Town  Airport it was actually quite weird to see them  have both an  elevator and stairs for passengers to  board But since it took only  30 minutes to board a rather full 737, it  works and makes ! I think that this flight has improved my  experiences on British Airways, and they were the same  fare as the  other South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next  trip to see how the two  for them compare, given the fact  they both are  selling a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd  rather happy to fly them again."
5.0,"Welcome to Gatwick.  Having flown with  BA on this  aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I  am intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was  far smarter -  many aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting  more pleasant. The  audio system was  also improved, with a good selection of media on  a touch screen  - I suppose  one reason I  enjoyed this was  that the old  aircraft were so hopelessly outdated! But  the family really  found them entertaining.  for me the  only issue was  the tight leg room - I  was a slim  little 2'' and  felt the lack of seat width made it almost  hard to eat a meal! It  felt for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It 's now 3-4-3.  Most were sat  in the 4 's although on return, we sat near the back  of economy where  as aircraft narrows  the seats become . We sat in a 2,  it was more  uncomfortable I also  felt the seat  too hard after  first couple of  hours although sitting  with the supplied back rest cushion  helps a bit!  With best efforts  to sleep, I  think I remember  the old seats  were more comfortable, especially for long  periods Service was  good and timely , food was  comparable to previous flights - edible.  In summary, it 's a shame . BA have  lost some aspects of the experience,  where seat comfort  had been sacrificed,  it is a  great pity."
1.0,"Welcome to London.  Our two hour  departure on 27th  January was delayed  for 3 hours with no heads up given by  the There was no sympathy or  concern , especially  as our original  flight was early , and with an email informing  us of the delay, we could  have stayed longer  with the hotel. "
10.0,"London to Dubai.  Now I am  now flying Premium Economy with British  Airlines The extra comfort compared to Economy Class is : The seat  looks way more comfortable, attendants are really professional and  extremely friendly. If just could add the leg rest into all the other seats, and not just the  front row (as  I used to  have in the  cheapest BA Premium  Class seats), then  it would be  great That's my  main note."
9.0,Tel Aviv to  Montreal via London.  This plane from London to Toronto  was run by  Fly Belgium The  experience from checkin until we received our cases here in Israel was excellent. The cabin  attendants on each airline were helpful and friendly. The food was all acceptable for economy  style food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was  available Soft drinks  was well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water  is served all during each flight. The planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class. Inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch  for 4 flights. I haven't travelled British Airways for years but I  might do again if the price is competitive as  on these flights
3.0,"I flew yesterday  from Heathrow to  Dubai in business  but from start to finish it  is a shambles.  As I was  taken to the  main baggage drop,  taken to the  north lounge, I  received my boarding  passes and sent to the north lounge the furthest  of the gate.  My boarding process was more like  the rugby scrum,  a notice was  given of class of service and  then my boarding  pass said assistance , so another  person was needed , explanation was  given for this."
8.0,"Our first part from Brussels to London Heathrow was a fast flight,  however on the  landing in London  the problems started.  A gate where the arriving plane was planned to  arrive was not  accessible what occurred in a waiting time on the  ground for 40 minutes. The captain  kindly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous. Continental breakfast in business  seemed OK for this short flight. Flight to Larnaca was full, embarkation  is prompt for business pax. The team was very friendly. The service started with a  sandwich and some cookies , the meal was good  however a more  modest appetiser could be expected - a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser. It  can be said  the meal was an improvement since last year. Decent drinks and a good Champagne were available, followed by  coffee or tea.  It is a longer flight - a second round  for drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional ."
2.0,London to London. Worst business class flight I have flown. Split seating for myself and  his wife because apparently they were overbooked. The meal was inedible for  me and was  probably worst airline  fare I have been served. 
2.0,"Seems like no one was aware  of my existence on the flight. No drink, no snack, no bottle  of water was offered. No amenity ! When I asked, they said none were left in stock. They gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush,  that was ok,  but fast track  food which was useless, since no  fast track is offered to British . I was not given a menu, I even had to ask for it. I was not served  a meal and they said it  is because I was sleeping. Ok ... but even  though I was  sleeping no one  bothered to ask  anything about the meal. I had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal.  So after all, no apologies from the staff. Too  often people are squeezed into business class. Even though I could lie down 180 degrees,  I had very  little space at my seat. Given the very expensive  tickets I expected a much better service for business class passengers. I'm very disappointed and will never use  BA again. I won't recommend British Airways business class  on anyone!"
7.0,"In economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The  food (I use  this term lightly)  looked fit for dogs on our  trip it was salmon we think as it didn’t  taste of anything,  some meat of some kind but  seemed too tough to stick a fork into let  less eat it.  The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or  coffee at breakfast and don’t bother  eating what was in the box , on our  plane I didn’t  fancy trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to  say don’t bother! Which in comparison  to the outbound flight (London to  Glasgow was worlds apart, greeted with  free drink which  was the first of many, dinner  very nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was  served with plenty  of drinks! Inflight entertainment was good  I though there  were supposed to be WiFi but couldn’t log on so saved some  cash there. I really thought this was going to  prove the best way to travel. Oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an  economy plane. But that really shouldn’t happen. What is  never told when booking, homeward flight  on the top of your ticket if you have TSA PRE you don’t have to  brave the massive queue, look for  the entered TSA line that’s the  line that’s empty cause they tell  every one about it."
1.0,"Lisbon to London. Business class is just economy class with an empty  aisle seat. No leg room for  passengers Meal service had no choice  until the time  they got halfway  into business class.  All that was left was cod. Freezing cold, but no blankets. Poor staff spent most  on the flight . Never fly  Qatar Airways. "
1.0,"Welcome to Marseille. Within a few days of booking a flight for  the BA advised flight has been  delayed to late evening arrival. This  is unacceptable so  we opt to  book and full  refund BA then  says it is  in the fare  it makes no mention of the fee I have  incurred for seat selection. I have  submitted a claim  form for refund  for these fees,  upon submission they  say they will  need up to  60 days to  think about it."
3.0,"London to London . British Airways.  This is nothing  reminiscent of business  class on these  planes When they  bring the hot  seats it feels  just a bad joke. Seats are  the same as  before they took  time to hang  my jacket after  having asked in  numerous occasions, they  gave me a  bag that is  basically a bad  plane seat without  it (See picture) and on top  of everything I  see myself having  them put my  suitcase (just a  little far behind  the seat because they are choosing  to bring the  same hand luggage  and doesn’t fit  properly in coach  and business class.  Amazing service so  NOT worth the  extra cost that  a business class  ticket goes for.  I totally ripped  off"
1.0,"Flying to Glasgow. Awful experience. Our flight arrived over  two hours late  around 8.50pm, so late our car  rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without  our car. We  had to pay for a taxi to our hotel  and back to  our airport the  next day which was really expensive.  The new car hire was three times the price  as it was last minute. British  Rail would not  fully compensate because  they said it wasn’t their fault."
1.0,Frankfurt to London.  The staff watched while security went  through partner's bag for around 30 mins. It required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag  quite a while - actually just clothes. When they  started finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight. Only  30 minutes required. Much longer spent unloading my luggage. We had checked this bag in almost 2 hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time.
1.0,"Back to Olbia.  Further confusion. The  flight was delayed  getting to Sardinia,  well so we  did but following  customs at Sardinia  we were penned  in long lines,  no seats, extreme  cold and no  one in the  plane The airport  staff in Sardinia  seems to be  delayed Finally got  on the plane  and we’re now delayed on the  plane We are  due to depart  less than 3  minutes after our  original departure time, but so far  still stuck on  a tarmac with  zero updates. No  drinks provided. I  am unwell but  was told they  have no glasses,  had nothing to  eat Numerous small  bottles with no  glasses and high . After a  long time of  talking I was  advised I could  buy a drink  if we took  it but they  gave no idea  what that would  help They need  immediately abandon the  airport at this  stage before more people become unwell.  The crew just standing there, doing  nothing but looking  bored"
3.0,"Back to London  – After waiting  almost 6 hours  outside Rotterdam airport  yesterday I was  informed they re-routed my flight to Amsterdam and that  we needed to quickly catch a  train (that I  have to pay !) from Rotterdam  to Amsterdam airport  with the hope of catching the  flight from there.  When I worried  I wouldn’t make  flights I asked  we be put in a hotel  and fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as all  rooms are booked. There was no  accommodation no offer  of a bus  or taxis to  being re-routed to  Amsterdam And throughout  that process &  long queue no one bothered to explain to us  what was happening. Had I known we’d be re-routed  from Amsterdam I  would left Rotterdam  early rather than  stand in a  long queue just to he told  me info at  each end. What  total waste of time, energy &  effort And no  way to make  excuses for the  cancellation or delay. It’s quite unbelievable.  :)"
9.0,Return flight to  Dublin Outbound Galleries North fine and good breakfast. Flight was fine. Return  flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept  me informed. Lounge  in Dublin was generic lounge but was ok. Staff on both flights fine. Return aircraft quite new and well presented.
2.0,"Back to Gatwick.  I boarded a half full flight  but whilst preparing for take off the video was  recorded as normal,  The crew participation side of it  looked like trouble  with the crew.  Before inflight the  food service got  under way and  service was very quick I had  a beer and  her partner a  cold drink, I  was given a  room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my  partner her soft  drink and the  clear plastic cup  without mention of ice. Within 20  minutes the meal service commenced they  came to our  tables which were 3 from the back of the  plane and when  they were served two trays appeared  and passed to . I enquired  what the meal  served and we were both told Pasta it’s all  they have left,  anyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused  the pasta and  so proceeded to  explain why on  a half filled flight they had  pulled out, no  satisfactory answer came , but was  very rudely told  they would get  it from premium . I said  no one was  wrong as I  would eat the  pasta glad I did I think,  pressure was placed on my partners  shoulder it was ! During this service no further  meals were offered except for water, trays were gathered  and that was  all last we saw of the crew for 4  days They reappeared  approximately 70 minutes before landing served  another box containing  fresh bread with processed cheese and  a stale cake,  we politely refused  their offering and  My partner ate  his bread, tea and coffee was served.  Our  meal out 7 days previously was  an exact opposite,  no staff, food standard but acceptable.  My only other negative was the  plastic chairs played by fellow passengers, the crew turned a blind eye. The positives the  customer has a  good choice and we got home  early and getting  on the aircraft was a pleasure  but it was  among the coldest flights I have ever been on."
10.0,"I would like  to praise the  incredible courtesy and  professionalism I received  of the BA  Cabin crew members  onboard my flight BA0011 from London Heathrow to Singapore , 25 June.  The cabin crew  are both friendly  yet attentive to  all passengers needs, enabling them to  relax & enjoy  the flight. I feel very proud  that British Airways continue to train  cabin staff to such a very  professional standard, it really is a  privilege to fly  BA Airways."
1.0,"Paris to London Heathrow. This was my second trip Madrid to London on British Airways  in May. On this trip like the previous the plane broke down, and we waited 2.5 hours on  another plane for it to be repaired whilst the  weather outside was  100 degrees. The cabin crew director  gave passengers the  option to purchase  coffee and other  soft drinks from  the bar. Only  BA could try  and make money out of one  despite its technical failures. I then waited another hour  and pick up  my suitcase. As I'm a silver  bag holder, I could access their  baggage lounge in  cases I regret using it. Fortunately,  this was my  last ever trip on BA."
10.0,"BA762 Heathrow to  Amsterdam I have  flown with BA a few times in the last few months, I  have came off medication which makes  you more nervous flying on planes,  we had notified the cabin crew and they were honestly so amazing and went above  to beyond for . They had gave me a  small bottle of water, kept asking  who I was , put their  arms around me,  making me feel  so much better. The flight was super smooth and  such an amazing  experience Thanks again BA and I  shall be flying  back with you ."

Initial flight from Heathrow to Abu Dhabi was  also had to  resume a day earlier as flights  on following days were cancelled as  Customer Service with  only a free glass of water  for the first  from Abu Dhabi to London delayed by over 3hrs. A generous Dirham 20 voucher (£3,8) received from BA, which was enough  buy a bottle of water, or  instant coffee. "
7.0,"NEW York to Glasgow via London. A routine and  enjoyable overnight flight that departed the gate about 45  minutes late because  was a security issue at the terminal (#7). I had an electronic  gate pass on  the BA app but an announcement was made that  passengers needed to get paper versions.  There was a separate desk where a couple of  attendants performed this . The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred  words or even  attempted to describe ! I had  the aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The  window seat was  comfortable Enough leg space and storage  space overhead. A  large collection of  various sorts of  magazines with free  snacks provided. The  sound system was easy to use.  No drink service  mirrored the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully  served their centenary  beer specially brewed  Belgian Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave  out a Heineken  and a bottle of wine to  complete the dinner  I followed soon . The entree  choices were chicken  with pasta. I  enjoyed the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee ! Before landing  my sandwich and  a drink was  ordered I could  barely figure out  WHAT was in  that sandwich! The  plane was clean. Blankets and pillows  placed on every  seat Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done  off with. For the fare, I  think I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic  airline to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was  actually quite late. Newspapers were available  outside the gate - a worthy amenity. It was  another smooth flight in a 3-3  but I was in an aisle  - the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment.  My two flight  assistants once the plane reached cruising  altitude put on aprons and pushed  their cart down  an aisle hawking  sweets and elixirs.  The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier  flight a video  screen showed off  the safety instructions.  That was supposed to be funny  but engaging. I  felt it was neither - the  instructions of the  instructions were hard to understand. The  plane landed on time. Overall, a positive experience but  in time I will look into a non-stop flight  into Glasgow from New York. The transfer at Heathrow  was anxiety-inducing."
10.0,"London Heathrow to New York. The staff went above  an beyond to make sure we had a wonderful  new refreshing to see these days. The quality of food and drinks  was wonderful. There was plenty of leg room as well. We would definitely fly again with BA, and are planning on making this our only airline if  it flies to all of my destinations. On departure my TV did not work they tried twice to reset it for me, however this did not work. That was fine I resolved to reading my book. Just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us,  inquired if it had been rectified, I replied, no  no it was ok. She came back with a  bottle of Champagne,  another pair of  sunglasses and a makeup bag full of goodies, not  only for me but for my sister as well!! To say I  was overwhelmed was  an understatement! All I can say  is Thank you British Airways from the bottom of my heart! The trip was for  her Birthday and you certainly made  it something special!"
10.0,"Flying to Bermuda.  landed very quickly  & on time,  landing area smart,  and much better  then the old  hotels that normally  shows up. Service  was good, food  was the best  we have had  at BA, new  seat added to  a good feel , appearance, long  term Duvet and  mattress much better  then what you  get for this  same route, the  bed is fabulous,  so are the  same pillows and  we now have  a luxurious pillow , want to  give 10/10 for  the flight and  the crew, even  though it was full up front,  i hope this  is a turning  point for British  Airways Thank you I am looking  ahead to my  last flight in  Australia and my  last flight in  2018 keep it  going"
10.0,London Heathrow to  London Perfect. The  Saturday morning departure  meant that Terminal  5 was unusually quiet. The Galleries Lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment. The flight  lifted off and landed on time. The cabin crew  was incredibly attentive and provided a  highly professional and  comfortable onboard experience. Arrival procedures at Larnaca were incredibly efficient. We completed  customs and picked  out our hold baggage within 30 minutes of arriving  to the gate. All in all a very enjoyable trip.
6.0,"BA 2616 and 2617 return trip  from Gatwick to  Birmingham Both flights  were a Saturday  morning were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in  Row 7 outbound,  4 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed  larger than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been  in the BMI . Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board  for outward, but  did on the  plane The M&S sandwich was everything  I would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from  its cost), but  my coffee I  ordered and the tea my wife  ordered were below . It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to  go from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of  BA cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just  the passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and  a Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are  also given a cup of hot water to add  a coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return  from their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service  got collected by hand as we  was preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound  it was not  the great advertisement for BA. Perhaps  service at LGW  is not as good as at  home"
8.0,"Heathrow to Kalamata.  Flight T5 to  Athens Greece 8th June and return 1 week later.  2 Avios points  and upgrade to  third row seats  with more legroom. Bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from Heathrow (delays  from previous incoming flight) but made  up about 1/2 hour on the journey out. Also  to Kalamata about  1 hour late  in our return but landed virtually on time. Seats much more comfortable , more padding  than for example,  Amazon or Jet2.com so with the  more legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable. Expensive (or  better M&S offerings ), food but  tasty enough. Pleasant  weather so all  and all decent flights. Haven't used  it for short haul for quite  too few years  but would use  one if the  price was right."
3.0,"London to Gothenburg. Unique procedures that  is not adding any order but  causing a lot  more mess. Extra  security checks, passport checks, separate queues,  passport controls. Heathrow Terminal 5 is the most bizarre."
1.0,"Flight to London  - 15th April.  We arrived 3  minutes before flight . I waited  a line for  an hour while  I attended to  other people in  a what seemed  like a turtle  or snail like  state of urgency.  And that rather  annoying delay.When I  arrived to the  airport on time,  I was told the gate was  empty Thinking it  must have been  any kind of joke, I noted  that the British  Airways representatives saying  whether I was  in time. She replied yes but  they were the last person, everyone had made it  before me, my  bags were already  there she continued  onto say.  Me asking what  could I do . Not having  the ability to ring abroad I  ask if they  can help me  but they replied  yes there is  a Qantas office  in Amsterdam and they cannot help  you "
5.0,"Back to London. My first flight in Economy is  a new A321 . The aircraft  is set up  for the first  3 rows of  standard seats and  a remaining 17  rows of the  2 extra slim  back seats. The seat does not  and is very  uncomfortable and OK  within an hour , However 3  or 45 minutes  later it became pretty uncomfortable after  3 hours. The  2 members of  my cabin crew were great serving  their usual MS  on sale products."
5.0,"I had some difficulty from the start, after my initial booking the  website repeatedly asked  me to log in, even though I was already logged in. I  tried to reserve seats and request special meals. It  took me 2 days to achive this. I was amazed by the  simplicity of reserving ordinary seats, no  more legroom, this bumped the price  up for 4  people by £328 and seats were  already booked on the LHR-KUL and  later KUL-LHR legs.  I had difficulty checking in using the BA app and eventually did it using Malaysia Airlines app. Checking in online was only allowed 24hrs , making things  A little awkward being in Kuching  and our return leg with an 8 hr time . I was  looked forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but  it really is just a dream. Food choices we  were told ran  dry at breakfast, the choice was  Full English or  having an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we  are told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had  appeared with the  word English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and  I had to go to the  small galley to  pay for water. For an over 12h flight, I think the cabin  will at least be visited 2-3 times. Toilets were  clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a  rule was clean and tidy. The IFE selection was  good with many  of the latest  games available along  the games and  snacks Our return  flight from KL  and London was  extremely cold, the  BA 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat."
6.0,"Welcome to Dusseldorf.  No free drinks  or food, which  was pretty normal for short haul . Crew was  pretty average Seat was average. Ground  Level was pretty . No inflight entertainment. "
1.0,"London to Seoul.  Same experience with British Airways almost constantly. My Business  class is downgraded  from economy at  very last minute with a 12  hours long-hauls flight! Lounge simy sucks, cheap, noisy and  has Multiple malfunction es on the aircraft including unfolded table. Given the price it Charge, certainly one of the worst airlines  you can possible take."
7.0,"Got to Vancouver.  Class was a  little more cramped  than I expected. BA had crammed  everyone in. Crew  was okay. Food  was really although  I had upgraded my food which  was before everyone  had had theirs , was a  One Flew back  into class, more . I probably  wont use them  next November when  I go back.  Sleep was good  and air quality  is ok as  i didn’t get  a headache."
3.0,"Newcastle to Delhi  from London. At  Newcastle , I  am charged for  carrying 2.8 kilos , which is  really no problem.  They paid a  fare of £65  on 2.8 kilos. On my flight from London to Delhi, during boarding  I asked for  food to which  an attendant told  me would get  if she was busy as customers were boarding the  plane I then  asked for  the bottle of  champagne  which she seemed to  understand  2  hours into the  plane journey, my  home entertainment system  became stuck on the TV and  sound feature. When  our dinner was served, Ithe meal consisted of chicken  breast and mash,  salad with bread , and a mousse. Delays caused  a British Airways  staff in the flight reaching Delhi late and me  missed my connecting . But as  I landed at  Mumbai and picked my baggage from  the belt, a  Jet Airways staff was ready with  my ticket from  Delhi to Mumbai  for me even  more "
1.0,Miami to Delhi  via London.  The BA business  class I flew  to the first  flight recently was  The worst I    flown.  And most have  no seats across  British Airways has   The lay up beds are  too thin and .. Not worth  your money.
3.0,"Flying to Sydney via Singapore. Checked in with a bag which was . My allowance  of 23kg. I was made to repackage the bag and take two  pairs of shoes  apart and place them in my hand luggage, really?  Also found the food on both legs of the  bag horrible."
4.0,"Flying to Amsterdam  and London. It  took 10 hrs  on a delayed flight, in a  cramped seat with  dim lights, no  overhead light. No  food of any  kind and food  was found exceptionally bad. The B747  flight was terribly maintained. The offer  of 20.GBP for  seat is insulting  which further exemplifies a lack of  respect for your  own comfort and  wellbeing"
3.0,"Standard, run of  your mill airline  for today's economy.  Air Tel Aviv to New York,  had a two  hour layover in  at Heathrow. Crew was fine, entertainment system on the  Paris to New York leg was very nice. The  last meal I ordered was not  in either of  these two flights. I  called them two and  one half weeks prior to departure to check that  my meals were in the system, and was assured they were. I submitted a complaint  on ba.com and  the responses I received were lame and unacceptable. Not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from British Airways, as I suggested topping off my Avios balance to a mere  100 points (my  score is around . "
5.0,"Belfast City to  Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in  went fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the  guy called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't  an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in  at the same  time without any difficulty. I knew  someone was working the premium line,  but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me.  Within about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go  to security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was  available for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service  from American in the US, but  he was fully  aware that BA  just turned itself  onto a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I  thought it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in  front of the  huge cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called,  I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants  seemed very polite and helpful to customers, even in  turbulence The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had  elbow room and  the nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a  beverage selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food  was the bland ness of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they  provided was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic  containers without a  cup and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a  regular carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a  huge smile. Those smiles have disappeared  at the most  part and the feeling of flying  a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got  my bag. The  flight was also nice and spacious and the flight  attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at  BA"
10.0,"Without Aires to  which I wish to thank the crew that was  incredibly nice to  me while I  was terribly sick. Wish I knew their names! They  got me medicine,  my blanket and  scratched my back  until I was  recovering from the  terrible ache. Forever grateful."
1.0,"London to Nashville. The worst airline Trans-Atlantic. Despite looking forward to flying on this new  plane to Nashville, British Airways ruined this trip. The flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the  outgoing aircraft with  another inbound Boeing 787-9 from San  Antonio The airplane was filthy dirty  and Club Class,  it is bad enough having to  take the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider.  Club Class on British Airways is the worst of  the airline. The  plane was out of service. On late arrival in  London my luggage  was soaking wet, and I was  forced to change clothes. On my  return to the  gate I contacted  British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got  the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. I am now forced to haggle with  US Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations department. It is a real shame  I witness the decline of this national carrier. British  Airlines treat their  first class customers with contempt. This  is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from Heathrow. "
10.0,It was delayed by almost two  years and it was nice when  he gave us  their only Boeing 747-400 that was in old BOAC S colours the seats where wide  but comfortable plenty of storage the IFE was average  service was good and in generous  size but what  stuck out was  a high level  in service and friendliness!
1.0,"I checked in for a flight  to Newcastle with BA. The check in process was  about 45 minutes queuing. 2 BA staff working in two desks, one  of which was a virtually empty  white queue in  fact the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The process was ridiculously slow with each  checking in taking several minutes. When the priority queue  was deigned to  accept economy passengers, she seemed to  take an eternity.  For the 45  hours it took us, the queue never dropped below  around 100 people. I have never  checked in a  longer or more disorganised check in !! The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff! The  boarding sign displayed at the BA  desk should have  be located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of “you’re in  here a long ! To cap  them all, after enduring the queue,  I now delayed  30 minutes thus far! So unprofessional!"
8.0,"Back to Madrid.  When I arrived  I waited for  four and a  quarter hours for  the one suitcase. It didn’t arrive.  Then I was asked to fill  in a ‘lost luggage’ form which  i did and  gave a number to call the  same day. The  lady said she’d  be sure the  luggage was delivered  before 5.00 p.m.  She was out during the day.  When I returned later that evening there was no . It hadn’t been delivered. The next morning (Sunday) I phoned the  number again. The  first message said  turn back on … As I  started leaving on  Monday night this was pointless. I  am leaving Madrid at 8.30 pm. My one suitcase arrived two hours  after I left . So I spent the whole time in Madrid without my medicines,  changes of clothes, toiletries etc which  ends up wasting  a lot of  my (short, valuable) time buying essentials  which I needed  from there."
1.0,"A boyfriend and I wanted to return from our  trip to London  one day early  and the BA  app and website continued to glitch so I called  to ask how  easy it would be to leave  1 day earlier.  We was told  that the penalty  fees for changing  your flight is  $ each and  that a $50  charge for them  and do it  on the phone  was $600, and  a price of  the flight by  half We decided  and try our  luck again changing  planes on the  flight and paid  someone to change  our flight to  one day earlier  and make it  up for an  hour The flight  got delayed and  left 1hr 55 mins late. We missed our event. The plane was  freezing and my  computer didn’t work. I asked the flight attendant for  something to clean the slimy finger  paint off the  plane with and  she told me  was normal wear  & tear but  we could get toilet paper from  a bathroom. I  wanted to ask  for a refund for the fees  for the flight  being delayed but they told me  she can’t give  me a refund  unless we got  on the flight."
6.0,"They had kept  the laptop bag  inside the overhead ! Somebody got  them a bigger  computer bag and  we couldn't fit  my bag in  the space remaining,  so they kept  my bag on  a laptop bag.  After I asked  a flight attendant to help me  correct this, he  told me to  check my luggage .  I was travelling with only one laptop  I placed it  in the cabin  area over my  seat and instead  of asking the  computer bag to be placed properly  I kept it  in my bag  which was in  transit before the  other bag came  it was asked to be moved ! How fair  was this? "
8.0,"London to Delhi.  a truly first class experience from check in to landing. I am a frequent flyer  to BA and  have not always had an amazing  experience this one . Check in  is easy and swift and the Concorde Room was excellent. The flight  crew was wonderful, while I accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the  sky the service  were second to none. The cabin crew were friendly greeting us by  phone and showing  me personally to  our seats. Throughout they ensured we  were very well  cared after without  ever being overbearing. New soft product  is very good  and food definitely  much improved. "
1.0,"London Heathrow to  Dubai Last Sunday  We unfortunately missed  our BA flight to Dubai due to unforeseen circumstances,  therefore we booked  our next available flight for the morning which was  on Emirates. Today  We arrived at Dubai airport expecting  to board the  return home that  we had already  booked for months in advance. At check in the  airport staff told  me that our flight had been  cancelled as we  lost our outgoing flight. We have  not received a  replacement for the  delay and they  have refused to  give us the  ticket we had  requested "
10.0,"London to Seattle. My husband and I have used  the service for a number of years as our son lives in  Seattle We have always been very satisfied with the service. Unfortunately I  got taken ill  during this flight and the service went from good to superb! I’d like to thank the cabin crew and Captain for  the care I  received during the last two hours of the flight. Advice was sought via radio, I  am made comfortable  in the galley, at least one crew member with me at all times, given oxygen etc. paramedic boarded the plane and  helped me off when I was then given a  thorough medical check, a wheel chair  sat waiting and  then were fast tracked through customs  and I was  feeling well enough  to walk to the car park. We met the crew at the lift and the captain came to  see how I was. Many thanks  for all of  this and apologies to passengers that  they must have  missed"
5.0,"Johannesburg to London. I booked a seat without luggage. Firstly one cannot  have one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage. This  is an issue when trying to seat together. When the passenger without  luggage tried to move seats (normally a free option  in standard seats), you get advised that you have to pay. This was not disclosed when the booking was made. It was irritating because one of us was ill. "
9.0,"Flight to Milan.  This outbound flight  has some on  board space so  my seat was . Boarding by group number worked  well and I  was able to  store my laptop  from the overhead.  Local newspapers were available in the  aisle way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one  seat behind emergency  exit and despite  many requests from  a steward woman  up front was  quite challenging in  order to have  the bag stored  in the overhead  area the steward  acted very politely  and patiently. Usual  to board trolley  provided which I  now use. Flight  was 10 minutes  late due to  no taxi way  delays due to  a head wind  arriving in Linate  15 minutes late.  The flight could have been a  delayed due to  another strike but  a very full  and departed on  schedule and landed  30 minutes early.  Our cabin crew  of this flight  is excellent especially  a senior stewardess  that was warm ly friendly towards  every single customer , outstanding. We  were taken off  of aircraft and  went into T5  and I think  it saved time  because the entrance is directly below  traffic control. All  and all a  couple of very  successful flights."
10.0,"My connecting flight  from Johannesburg was  on an older  aircraft with proper  business class seats  and lots of  space Pre-take off  food offered and  another decent meal  on a short  break Everything went  smoothly and service  very good. Boarding  in the main  flight was on  schedule and proceeded  as we were  sat on the  flight deck in  a forward cabin.  Little has been  said about the  current ying-yang seat configuration. The seats  were narrow, and  it is a  lot of privacy  along the aisle  - with probably the main complaint being lack of  space for personal  items around the  seats However the  seat is very  good in any  way and the  Air Company bedding  looks excellent. We  chose an aisle  between centre seats  towards the rear  facing the cabin,  which worked well  for a couple  had the privacy  were left down. The centre seat  does have a shelf for personal  belongings and access  to this seat  would not require  transferring over another  seat The service  on this flight  were superb, from  a welcome on  arrival and continuing  through the flight - very efficient,  fast to respond,  but super friendly.  Free champagne or fruit juice was  available as soon  when we were  onboard with a  good service as  soon as the seat belt light  was off. There  were a choice  from 4 starters,  4 mains, and  4 sweets or  snacks with a  small choice of  snacks Breakfast offered  another good choice,  but we were  provided with just  fresh fruit, yoghurt,  & bread. There  can be no  improvement in respect  for catering. The  747 is a super aircraft and  very quiet, but  I doubt the  standout feature of  this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight  to Leeds was  OK but compared  against our South  West flight it was noticeable that  this was economy  economy seats and  seats with just  the empty middle seat. It is  a short flight,  and there was  still a full  flight service. The  only poor aspect  of this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport  looked quite run-down,  computers not working,  with few staff  could be seen.  There was only  the other arrival,  so we still  took over 30  minutes for luggage  and come through."
9.0,"WA Heathrow to Los Angeles. Very  nice experience. I  heard other reviews  on BA but  it was not  my experience we  had From the  check in to  our lounge and on board the  flight our experience  were fantastic. Crew on the flight  were outstanding and  very attentive. Food  very good, not  amazing but very  good Seats worked  great and comfy  and on that  is the seat , Again, the  excellent crew and  made or break  the experience and  the crew hit  a home run. In flight entertainment  works well but was not streaming with I like  watching the monitors.  BA does a  pretty good job  for this One  Way route as  usual but I  will take BA  over AA if you can but  both airlines do  really good job  for these longer  flights"
7.0,"Delta is definitely  having its act together: BA's Galleries  restaurant is spacious  offering a good selection of food and staff actually  tried to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one  on the better  seats when flying  from Club World.  And despite the  cramped yin/yang seats  and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The  comfortable bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and  a large pillow  case feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW G design, which  caused delays while  menus were brought  out to passengers ! On the  whole I think  that works and having the 'triple  bar roll already on the tray  shows that the  meal is there  if you want  it rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has  come streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards  sent in before . Apart from some inevitable turbulence,  this flight went  mostly to plan : we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule.  Very good flight,  anything but an  ordinary style business  class experience."
1.0,"Flight to Belfast  from London. The legroom on the Sofia to Heathrow flight was terrible.  i am not  sure but my  feet were pushing  into the seat in front.   Service was non functional unless you want to pay  the prices. Where  is the service . There was  another bad delay  for the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed  a re-enter the  flight when the  engine developed a fault, as we had gone through !  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed  a re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us  in texts. The delay lasted 2  hour 55 minutes,  not short enough  and avoid compensation. The Belfast flight had a lot  more legroom than  our 3-hour flight  to Sofia.   I will never set foot on  any airline again. "
5.0,"Welcome to Gatwick.  Friendly and courteous  ground crew.   Each seat was  uncomfortable and the  onboard flight entertainment system derisory. The  seating was small  as in poor  quality Movies shown  by the in  the magazine were  poor and the  quality of movies  was poor. The  TV screen failed to respond correctly  or at times  and without warning,  with the sound  down to maximum  without touching the screen or handset.  A 12 hr  flight with a  poor entertainment system."
3.0,"Flying to Auckland  from Singapore with British Airways. Service  is very good , comfort was  really bad, for  my 14 hour  flight had no more leg room than I did  for an hour  flight I was uncomfortable and as  the regular flyer I have used  several airlines that  provide much more space for long  leg flights."
4.0,"I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the  cabin During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits )  but OK served  in freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg  looked like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight.  I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. When I arrived in Singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to  the special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight."
3.0,"Flight was OK, minor delay didn't both me. What was astonishing is  when we had  them wait an  hours or so to drop off our luggage because at Lyon Airport they were training  their ground staff at the same time? They continued doing this even  after the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out  and make it to the flight."
3.0,"Gatwick to Barbados  - I normally  fly on BA  with low expectations with the result that I am  sometimes too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly  surprised The outbound flight was about par for the  road with a  very comfortable seat  with an OK  airline crew that  were just about  happy to look  after us and  kept the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave  almost on time , managed to land in Barbados  before the Virgin  flight that was  due to leave Gatwick five minutes  after us, with  another result that  it got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a  day later managed  and reinforce my  high expectations of  BA with one  or the poorer  experiences that we 've experienced over  these last few  months Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who  is looking after  that part of  your cabin) somehow  feel they have  you rush through every part of  your drinks and  food service that  quickly becomes an  inconvenience The pre  flight drinks were missed on all  the seats on  my left hand  wall of the  middle cabin (not a big deal  although irritating non the less). No  butter was served with dinner, despite  their being butter  in the plate,  so I presume  this was missed.  my wife had ordered a veggie  salad and was  there about ten minutes before everyone else, which was  great However, as the crew were serving the remaining  food there was  a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each  had on their  respective trolleys. When  it reached our  seat they somehow  decided it would  make a good  time to try and pass a  whole tray of  chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with  the result that  some red hot  gravy spilled on  all my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have  her napkin in place which absorbed  some of the  liquid It also  landed on my  plate which thankfully had the cover !! A very brief apology was  made but without any sincerity and  we suspect blissfully  oblivious of the obvious mistake they  have made. My  remaining wine was  served but not the rest of  the dinner. Once  home we landed  within time, which  was a good thing. Overall, the  whole flight was  pretty poor."
4.0,"Marseille to London. I am generally annoyed with the  efficiency of the service. I believe that we should  only have to  ask for a  cup of water with slice of  cheese in a  domestic flight. I realised that I forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control. I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff  directed me to terminal 5 at  the lost and found to pick  at my bag  but it was not even there. Luckily, I decided to stop on the way in  the lost and  found of terminal 3, where they  ( friendly lost and found staff , not the BA staff) nicely explained me that  this was no  need for me  to go there and called some other agents to help me. "
10.0,"The cabin crew on flight BA035 London to Chennai were very efficient and did their  utmost to take care of their  passengers I did tell them I would write a review and here  that is. Keep  on the good  work and, thanks!"
8.0,"Flight to Malaga.  Flying in was  fairly quick. The  check in area  at Gatwick is  really nice although  they are failing with general upkeep.  A whole area  required vacuuming and  there were stains  / signs of  chew gum on  some carpets. If  your not going  and look after it then you  should just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at  security is really  clean and whilst  I was very  small there were still available comfy and desk style  seats to suit.  Their food and drink offering was  very good. Tasty and varied. On  arrival I was  happy to be  able to book  an exit row,  which actually makes  your seats better  than club in  our opinion. Food  & drinks service  is fairly slow  although being near the front this wasn’t a problem  for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of  drinks or snacks..  the selection is  good What was  really nice was,  near the end  of the flight  one was given  1 free glass of champagne for  being a silver member. I wouldn’t  expect this, and  am sure it’s  just because they  left a bottle  to use up,  however it was  a nice gesture to show to  other flyers. Still  no WiFi or  internet based in  flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags  as usual are  kind of irrelevant.  The bag took quite a long  way to come  out and was  surrounded by dozens  more non priority  bags Overall a  great flight, and  very good value  as I paid  my avios. Being  upgraded and getting  good access and  great seat selection was a massive  plus"
6.0,"Return to London Heathrow, was excited  to experience A380  as the first time. Paid a  hefty $91 for  the seat selection  on the upper . Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the  seats Seat itself  being the standard  but comfortable. The  flight was efficiently  handled for such  an large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd  in front of  the gate. The inflight service for  the outbound leg was less than  satisfactory The food was very mediocre  At best -  never worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the  flight midflight. The  bumps being so  very easily absorbed  - Return was  like a B777 - flight was  half full but almost full. The  passenger service and the food served  are both remarkably better than the  previous journey. The baggage drop area however was a  nightmare None of the machines worked  and there was  a kind hearted person assisting passengers.  Plane boarding was  never very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was  OK but not  the good as some long haul . If both legs had similar  flight crew and food I would have scored them  equally "
7.0,"London to Cape lla in First , our first taste of the  new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a  30 year-old 747  still hadn't had its refurbishment and  was showing its age. A wardrobe  door that's falling  from its hinges,  its non-touch touch screen and a  sliding door in  a washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster  on First and  give the impression of the positive changes in the  food service. The  new mixed fleet  attendants did a  good job and  handled drinks and  snacks efficiently without  the wait other  customers have complained ! Care was  well taken in  preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing  looked overcooked and  all the beef was decent. Bedding  was also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen  design and the  Bluetooth headphones are  better worn for  longer than the  length of a  short film. The goodies bag is  even better and  easier taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but  still remains to  be seen what BA will do  with its long-in-the-tooth  Economy Class when  their new Club  seats are launched."
8.0,"This review is specifically aimed at  an excellent cabin  service on BA  Flight from JFK  to York to  London on Tue  27 May. I  am travelling back from New York  for a few days break with  two girlfriends. Check  in and boarding  are all on  but it was  reported that there  was a technical  issue and the  captain advised passengers  and some assistance  is required to rectify the issue;  this resulted in  nearly an hour's  delays leaving NY. Despite this annoying  situation the cabin  crew more than  makes up for this. They were friendly, polite and  would do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable , enjoyable, they  were all exceptional,  including those that  did not serving  within the section I was in. I do hope that this information  gets passed on."
1.0,"Welcome to Aberdeen.  After boarding the  aircraft I was forced to check  out my bag  at the gate  because apparently the  plane was full  because I was  still in Group . I was  happy with the  baggage allowance and discussed with the  staff at the  Main Gate. I  observed people boarding with Tax free bags on top  of the other , Being almost  always last on  a plane, there  was free spaces  which accommodate bags.  I was not happy because I  had the permitted  bags "
1.0,"Back to Dubrovnik. Overcrowded lounges, business class seats same as economy with middle seat empty.  The lounge opens  1 hr before some EU flights  this morning only and met by a large queue. And now frequent  travellers don’t get  checked baggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets."
1.0,"We paid an  estimated £500 for  two Premium economy seats on this  short haul flight  which was very  bad The seat  felt small and was shabby, the  LCD screen was small and very dark. I tried to adjust it but it was  completely unwatchable. The whole experience was very poor, not Premium in any . The return  trip was a  double share with  the Airines which  had Premium, a  totally different experience.  You would be happy to pay for their Premium  seats I would advise avoid British  Air Premium economy  as it is  different from Premium.  This felt a  huge waste of  cash"
2.0,Faro to Heathrow. Flight was very good no issues  in all but yet again baggage  handling was a disaster. We fly club or first  half the time and without fail the baggage is always last off. Spoke to BA  again and they  are clueless and had no idea  when this happens or how to stop it and correct it. Same happened on flight out too. It is a shambles  & a disgrace. Waited 39 mins got cases at Heathrow and this  was unacceptable will kit be using them again. Avoid at all costs.
9.0,"Vancouver to London. An excellent flight on BA. I travel this route several times a  week and generally BA are much better than AC,  but on this flight, BA were way ahead of  their competition. Seats comfortable, food pretty good for economy, decent wine and the in flight crew, simply outstanding.  Everyone smiling, friendly. They embodied BA  at their very best."
1.0,"Gatwick to Tenerife.  Something so wrong. Lounge really overcrowded , food on  my plane pretty  much left most of it. Paid for and travelling  Economy Class and  sitting four rows  down from my  seat  this  was normal procedure.  But on top  off a £2000  one night holiday I should have  paid another hundred  dollars plus to  stay with my partner - total ! This is  the airline with a self destruct button, such a shame.Have just booked  flights for our next flights to Barcelona and Buenos  and did not even bother to  look at BA."
8.0,"Washington to London.  I travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat  rude The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of  the cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice  in both food  and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing  and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model  of all future cabin crew training."
10.0,"Rome Fiumicino to London City. A  great Cityflyer service.  Great wait to  get in. Aircraft  is not full.  Finally pushed back , and arrived : This route  also has complimentary  service in economy, including wine – a great bonus and pleasant surprise.  Customer service was  friendly and professional.  A really excellent flight."
2.0,"On to Shanghai. The most disappointing  first class I  have flown in  an long time.  My plane was  very worn and  dusty (there were  bits of food  on the seat  and the floor  of a previous ) It took  2 hours to  arrange drinks service  or reach my  gate after take  out - the  flight followed shortly,  which was over ). They seemed  not be short  of staff. However,  which made me  really angry was  that there were  passengers in the  plane who had  requested both drinks  AND food and  was having their  requests turned down . I’d even  being offered a  meal The service  is exceptionally poor. I am flying  again tomorrow and  really not looking  forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder,  you might have  expected BA would  think their frequent  customers are being looked after? I’ll return to using  cheaper airlines in  the one world  market for my  short haul trips,  such as Cathay,  Norwegian or Finnair. The only reason  why I’ve given  more than one  airline is that  they managed to  sleep quite well  where the bedding  and pillows were , Ultimately though : sorry BA,  no good enough."
1.0,"Their customer service is horrible. Lost  our bags. Here we sit in London after 2.5  years of wearing  the same clothing.  We fly out  in 3 hours  from Barcelona for  our 14 day  tour and have  so much lost  all hope of  be reunited with  the bags before we go. I  spent so much  going on this  journey to celebrate  my husbands 60th birthday and our  second wedding anniversary.  That was supposed  ta be our  trip of a lifetime. We have  always been trying  and make light hearted things, but not getting our bags today, as  it now Friday and we left  last Tuesday AM  in Seattle, is heartbreaking. Not one  single person at  US Airways has  approached this with any kind of  kindness or empathy,  in that matter.  One customer service agent even asked  me if we  will be OK getting out to  Spain to ""pick  them up."" Truly  THE worst customer  service I've had."
9.0,"London City to Zurich, I fly  this route a  little around 8 times per year, The flight was delayed initially by an hour, I was kept up to date via the app so I was not disappointed. Around 45 minutes into the  journey one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a Happy Birthday followed by a bottle of Champagne, Brandy etc, this was totally unexpected, it made my day. Thanks  to the crew."
1.0,"we booked a flight from Bucharest to London and  Paris and when  our were at the airport, they  told us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours (from  midnight to 1pm),  then another 1 hour and a  minute (until 2:30 pm). We lost the money we  used for the bus tickets and  they would not  be Returning to Bucharest our flight  got delayed and they did not  immediately inform us about it. I  knew that unforeseen situation can happen,  as I have  never seen such  an poorly prepared company in my life."
10.0,"Flying to Calgary.  Wanted you to  being a Club  Canada flight attendant . BA 0103 April 15, 2019.  Customer service was  extremely attentive and  professional I thoroughly  enjoy the flight. </s>"
10.0,"Vancouver to London,  We were upgraded  from business class  at the airport. The staff were  just delightful and had a fabulous  service Really they could not have  looked more helpful . I would recommend them. "
8.0,"Welcome to London  Airport with British  Airways Top deck  Boeing 747 with one experienced and  three new crew members. Perfect welcome , appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for  breakfast Had a  drink and then settled down and  slept better than expected. On-time arrival and AA Arrivals  all was quiet  but good showers."
2.0,"On to London. The plane left  one hour late while an engineer  helped with a  – I’ve no  issue with that,  I like travelling , I thought,  and I’m sure  I booked an  extra seat online , it appears it was a  pity I missed out on the  last meal and  then I realised  I buzzed the  waiter and requested  another sandwich and  began explaining the problem. He fetched  himself a sandwich  and various bits he’d scrabbled together from the kitchen.  So when the  complimentary refreshment cane  in both my  hand and I  with water and  I had to  come across him  for my drink  and he helped  it to his  food and left  us to it."
4.0,"Back to Delhi.  The worst business  flight trip for us. Seats much smaller than business class on Singapore Air, Thai International,  Indian Air, Qantas;  all seated together  - same surname, Mr and Mrs - but moved . No privacy  in middle seats; one tiny drawer is only storage , shoes, iPad, makeup and sponge bag, book etc. Film/TV selection was very limited and  music choice wasn’t . The food  was very poor - main course congealed and so ot with a dessert that was  available no tea, coffee, or chocolates  available to us.  I had no  contact with the  staff Nobody came  out during the  night offering extra  water or other beverages. The crew didn’t put themselves . If one  asks more for  economy class one expects more and  they didn’t get it. I would  never choose to  take BA again."
1.0,"London to London.  The flight with  UK Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this . Initially I  am informed that under EU regulations I would receive  200 Euros compensation,  but be informed  two days later that this was  their error and  that I was  any longer getting  compensation British Airways  stated that sickness  on a crew  member is considered  exceptional circumstances (comparable  to weather issues) and that therefore,  you do not  need to compensate  me for this . However, there are court precedence  cases that clearly  states that crew  failure is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance  and that it is in an  employee responsibility to  provide a contingency  policy for such  circumstances or compensate  until they do . I have talked to the manager of customer service and was  informed that there is nothing they  should do as  it is their  fault I believe  that if not  a legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out  the customer service  simply because a  7 hour delay  ( Europe) is . Many times  are picked to  fly with British  Airways based on the expectations of good customer service  and the case  for anything going wrong. But this  has proved to  me that it's  well worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways."
9.0,London Heathrow to Bengaluru. I found  the crew very friendly and even humorous! Whenever the  crew passed through the aisle (I  was on a seat next to  an aisle) we  could exchange some friendly comments which  would always lead  to muffled laughs!  :-) One air  passenger admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter! 
1.0,"London to London.  I paid for  economy class and  BA paid for  the seats. The  first booking was  by Iberia (part of IAG which  operates BA, Iberia , Air lingus)  who clearly do  not integrate into  our systems since  not paying for  BA closing our  gate upon checking , we found  the seats had  been changed by BA (these flights  are operated by  Emirates and BA,  one being the return leg from  Paris to London ) BA explained that they would  have to check  if we were  getting a refund , total joke  since we paid  on the seats.  Apparently the BA  said the flight  was full and  could not change  our seats. No  explanation as to  why we paid  on specific seats  in business and  they were changed  by BA without  checking We'll accept  no refund on  this occasion since there is nothing  else we can  change and never use BA or  SAS again which  is a shame  because Iberia CS  have always reflected  BA and IAG . BA has  betrayed the customer  once again. Just  a poor BA  product and low  fares as always,  much more for  full fare business ! Rated 1/10  stars as we  felt let down , did not  receive an explanation  but were initially  disappointed that we  did not get  any refund on  being paid for  the seats!"
7.0,Flight to London Heathrow. British Airways offered a very  nice overall service  with this flight. I booked online  and found that  was very easy.  The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted  ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a  great account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within  these previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe  and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The  airport was relatively  small but well managed with a  handy drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort. One curiosity was the staff handing out  the landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.
4.0,"London to Seattle.  My seat was  at the upper  deck a nice perk for Seattle  flying to Europe (BA is the only one flying 747s to Europe from Seattle). Overall the product is . Service was not at the level it used  once be. Staff  is polite and  attentive but they keep the service  below a minimum.  Upper deck  staff on this  flight was mainly uninterested except the  basic minimum.  No additional service,  No top ups, not offering water  on the flight. Of course if you ask for something you do  receive it. There  is also a lot of traffic  on the stairway connecting upper and  middle deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck.  I hope BA will improve their act.  They certainly won’t  change their services  for foreseeable future."
10.0,"Flight to Gibraltar.  Check in at  JFK was fine, lounge was good , staff were more proactive than  was previously the  First Flight was good with decent  meal served including  all kids meals which were fine. Skilled landing in  Gibraltar a good flight"
5.0,"Back to Boston.  Boeing replaced A380  by a very old Boeing 747. Video system did not work for  longer than 1  hour then work for a few hours and stopped . No WIFI,  just old plane. Service OK. Not  recommended for business traveling."
6.0,"London to Doha. Similar to our  first flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are  comfortable try sleeping sitting up or  on the cradle position as the  pillow is just not long enough. The food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet, though the taste was ok. The entertainment system  was the worst selection of any airline I have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy  makes them a  very attractive option  when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage."
9.0,"London Heathrow to  Manchester Despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really  being looked after. Without exception all  the the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly  and professional. They really seemed to be enjoying their  flight Lunch and a pre landing  drink were provide together with an  Ice cream mid i Commendably, even  on these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with  Lemon Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs  were made. Despite its age the  cabin was well turned out internally. The only downside  was because of  the Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late.  Which meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic . This was  mainly down to  complicated Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our  bags and transfer  onto another terminal for our ongoing flight. All very stressful."
2.0,"London to London.  The A320 is  completely unsuitable for  a flight of  that length. The seat pitch and  size are the  worst for economy  or club. Having  paid €1000 for  this flight it's  like on flight  if you are  stuck for more  that 5 hours  for an expensive  Central Europe seat  the personal space  becomes so tight.  If the person  up front reclined  their seat it's  another nightmare. The  door in the  cabin is blocked , getting out  when the seats  in front are  blocked is hazardous. . You pay  on a Club ticket for space  & comfort and  for nothing. "
5.0,"Having booked my BA flight from  Zurich to London  Airport using Avios,  my frequent flyer  and had to  be added 3  pounds during the  booking process. When  I tried to  find an aisle  ticket (for medical ) the BA  system showed that  none of the  flight had been  taken save for  a few seats  for which I  must have had  to pay about  50 pounds. The  waiting area for  flights at Zurich  Airport is in  this hard to  find spot of  the airport. The  ticket agent was  very professional, helpful , informative. The  point of departure  from Zurich was  via transfer train. The flight boarded  with an orderly  fashion and left  better or less  record time. I  became dismayed to  see cabin crew  serve alcohol to  a group of  very drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the  flight crew declared  when she had run out of  wine and then  suggested to an  overly loud and  drunk man that  he might like  some cider instead.  During the meantime  the same crew  repeatedly ignored me  as other passengers  in offering the  usual service. The  airline maps were  well used and  the captain made  many announcements during  this flight none  in which were  clearly German. The  flight arrived reasonably  late"
6.0,My booking process  seemed easy enough  as they have  lowered the baggage  limits in terms  to the seats  passengers can book.  The cost of including a bag  reduced considerably to  our cheapest fare.  Everything was well  organised and it  was good to see passengers with  not much luggage  happy to check  their bags in.  Staff was well  organized and although  there was a  problem the captain  worked well. My  complaint is that  the seat was dirty and the  bathroom was also  dirty  Some  places the to asty M&S food  carts were not  good and the  one I used  was dirty. The  people were very  nice and pleasant  while the drop-down route map was nice especially for  the younger passengers  to enjoy. Hardworking .
10.0,"London to Tokyo Narita. Had a  return flight in the new BA  business cabin on  a Boeing 787. On both journeys the crew were  friendly as was  their food and  drink service. The food was of high end restaurant standard, the seat comfortable."
3.0,"Flying to London  – Paid for  the Business Class flight. The onboard service was abysmal.  Few refreshments offered  upon boarding. Dinner took three hours  to be served  in a night ! My Husband had to go  to the Galley  Bar for his dinner requests, he’d  completely forgotten. I requested ‘Express’ service,  that didn’t happen. Website advertises ‘Premium  Quality of Service’  and ‘Every Journey  Magical and Unforgettable.’  The service was  good but the  experience was definitely unforgettable for the  wrong reasons. Don’t  spend your money  on this airline,  you don’t get  what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty  programs and telling  customers that you  will pay for  the Service, that  the extra costs  account for taxes, the Lounge and  your loyalty points.  All BA could  live with was a goodwill gesture  of loyalty points. ."
1.0,"St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking  of the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew , it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on  board to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats  to be allocated  as we went through the departure gate. Once in  a departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more  or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us  were to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the  luggage hall did not come and find us, we  decided to go  back find him when he also  advised me that he had put  my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly  nor wrongly, was  so we could not tell people  sat beside us  that the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the  woman sitting beside  the wife telling her this was  why the seat  they had been allocated was soaking  soaked and smelt of urine and the cabin crew  then asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats  allocated to us which was no problem. What further  angered me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest  ad celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies  this advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end  on the flight my wife and I were surely  feeling it. Article  1 of EC Regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you."
1.0,"Chicago to London. Cancelled flights just a few hours before I left home, then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting ! Was finally put on a different flight. On  our way home, because my first  booking was through American Airlines, and the second through British Airways (all in the same booking), I was only able to check in and get a seat on the American  Express flight, as I was redirected  on time to their website. Couldn’t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. I always check  in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but BA wouldn’t allow me to do this."
1.0,Flying to Bangalore.  That was the worst experience. I flew with my  only daughter ande cabin crew was  so rude. I was surprised that there was no way to heat  up for my daughter. I found the food portions  quite meagre. Not sufficient for a child also.   Indian Airways is sad in every  aspect of the term.
3.0,"Europe to Abu Dhabi via Heathrow.  The 1.5h flight  via Hamburg to  Cairo was like  having a budget ! No free  tickets at all,  everything has to be purchased at  bargain prices. Heathrow  has the usual chaos. I can  remember the F Lounge due to  a One World ! Massive lounge,  filled with the charm and food  quality of a  hotel Toilets filthy.  None of the  best lounges I’ve  experienced Boarding orderly  and well organized. Boeing 788 IFE  is broken. Seats  are uncomfortable and narrow. Service and  product quality average.  From Abu Dhabi , Heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to  the arrival of the flight crew,  which is something  I have never experieinced before. Rest of the journey uneventful. Overall a  pretty disappointing experience.  I cannot compete  with the Middle  Eastern carriers."
10.0,Back to Seville.  following on from  my booking a  direct flight with  them despite having  no previous confirmed  flights with a  carrier I quickly  rang up BA  to resolve the  problem They understood  my problem and  sent me a  full refund. The  staff was exceptionally  friendly on the  phone and provided  us a quick  explanation and solution  of the problem.  I don’t believe  many airlines would  of accepted my  booking however it’s  great to see  BA treat their  customers with care.
7.0,"On to Paris  and London. This  is the first  time using BA  from October 2002,  nothing has changed,  the same  old business class , with very  limited storage space  and comfortable but  BA business has  kept up with  them and left  it behind, with  very poor entertainment  experience and limited  product choice. It  can compare with  the business leaders , Cathay and  Qatar Airways but  on this route  and charges the  same price as  British Airways but delivers a much  cheaper product, though  their service was  probably not as  fast but alright.  What they are  lacking is with  the check in  baggage policy of  10 bags 32 kg each they  look superior and  although I will  always use them  and look forward  seeing them rolling  out the new  business class."
10.0,"Scotland to London BA0457 on the  Emirates Couldn't have  been a better service. Long time  since I flew  to Europe but  this was an amazing experience. The  atmosphere aboard was excellent and so was the service and food. Stephen, one of the  flight attendants was  very attentive and happy to help  - he probably  considered it the  best short haul  flying experience I 'd had in a long time. Well done to  your crew on  that flight!"
2.0,"On the flight to Tokyo, I was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon. Thanks. The return felt like a 12  hr easyJet flight. One meal and one half meal.  No drinks. Very  comfortable seats. I’m 5 foot 9  so my knees touched the seat  out front. Very,  very mediocre."
7.0,"Welcome to Vancouver. Check in agent very helpful in searching out seat . Very smooth process. The disappointment  is the receptionist  at the Galleries  counter at T3 who was rude  and unhelpful. All  were redeemed once  on board. The  accommodations were excellent  and the flight  in the best  Canadian Airways tradition , friendly, helpful and attentive. Food  not great but  on a par with economy in  other airlines. Wines  better than many . The aircraft  looked clean and  was well maintained  despite an older  flight IFE selection good."
8.0,"The First Class zone at Heathrow T5 and the Concorde Lounge are  not good. Service on board was  good in both directions. The cabin  quality is unimpressive and the food  was nothing to  say home about. The screen is small, with poor resolution. I enjoyed the flights in  two directions, mainly  out of the service. This First  does not compare well with that of Middle Eastern  & Asian airlines, but BA business  service is so poor, I either  fly economy or  if I am very lucky) try to fly First."
2.0,I had a miserable experience in first class from London to Chicago. I had requested a special meal but that was not available. When I complained to  customer relations they  just said too bad and insulted me by offering  20 K miles. The bathroom lacked  amenities and i found the service was barebones. The angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot ! Video screen  is small and  should be stowed away 20 min  before landing. Cabin crew never asked what I wanted and were only available when you press the call ! In flight entertainment is poor. 
6.0,South Bradford to Las Vegas via Heathrow. Customer services handling of my question never answered it. Three times I asked them to explain why  I cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase  over £100 on the outbound flight. This was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short LBA LHR fare. I asked why the fare was so much when I could 've booked a seat for the  day for about . The response was we are doing what everyone else is doing. They never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when I indicated one  checked bag. I  asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to. Book LHR LAS at that time and one bag included. Customer service apparently did not understand what I was asking because the answer provided was : 
1.0,"Welcome to London  arriving in First Class. This is the worst experience I have had on a flight. The crew was  rude and unresponsive, and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them. There was even less service from this so called first class crew than  we get in tourist class in most airlines. The attitude and service of the crew was abysmal. When you have average food and wine  in offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class, at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying . This was nothing but a waste of money. I doubt very much I will  come back to British Airways again."
2.0,"Flying to Heathrow.  Essentially a budget airline masquerading at  premium airline prices.  Had flown several budget airlines in  years past which  all offered far  more in terms of value for  face and service.  Controls are rigid  and I felt  As if I  were leaning forward  towards the the  middle of the  plane When I  went to put  a seat back  or recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is  also non existent.  Our food ran out halfway through  our 5 hour  flight and although  the crew were  responsible for food  would run out  during a lunchtime  this is inexcusable  but highlights how  poorly the airline  are being managed  by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport  have flights leaving  straight from the  terminal requiring no bussing of passengers.  Once again in  their move to  earn money opt s bussing passengers to the far reaches of the  city to avoid  any extra charges  and utilising direct  service from airport . Can't fault  the staff onboard  that are clearly dedicated to the  British brand. They  were professional, friendly  & courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not  an airline they  formerly were and  we hope that passengers begin to  reconcile with their  frustrations as drastic  measures are needed  towards bring the  airline back to  its former glory."
1.0,"Paris to Larnaca - departed on  a flight nearly  every M&S food  served to passengers ran out while  flight crew were half way down  an aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca  saying - the  flight would be  late by over  1 hour-departure was supposed to be  about 7.15 pm  and we took  off nearer to  9 pm. The  third message was  - there was no food to  passengers served on the flight, ""we recognise that this  did not meet with the standards  we expect from ."" The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination  of a delayed  departure and no  meal available on  board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget . A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged  € 75 on  the return leg  of my case - it was  actually the same  bag that I  went out to Cyprus with but the system identified  this as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under hand description of the service offered  by customers. The only saving grace  is the cabin crew-particularly the Customer  Support Manager-who promised to follow up  the baggage issue  having logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and  helpful throughout. How British Airways can  deliver such a  great product and expect people to keep flying with  us is beyond  belief"
9.0,"Los Angeles to  London A very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo  the retractable divider gives you privacy  with your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the ""turn right"" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with  wine served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to  the passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film  on for everyone. Thanks also to  those people most of us forget  and the flight crew who got us safely to  Frankfurt 15 minutes early and put  their plane down so gently we hardly noticed we  had arrived! Well done BA for providing such a good product and service."
2.0,"Got to Phoenix,  Arizona yesterday. The  airplane was supposed  ta land at . However, it  lands at 1940.  Because of this  I missed my connecting flight to Ontario, California aboard  American Airlines. By  the time I was able to go through custom and pick up  the luggage, it  is already 2030.  That flight departs  at 2037. I went to the ground crew of  American Airlines, they  tell me that I will not  been able to  get it to  the connecting flight  as they are  not on the  schedule They then  referred me to  American Airways. I  talked to the  flight attendant of  British Airways and  she told me to go back to American Airlines  to get it  again booked. I  came back to  US Airlines then  they told me again to back  off British Airways since they are  also the one  which caused the  problems I went back to British  Air with the  American Airlines supervisor.  A British Airways  employee gave me  my card with  their customer service  number and told me to call  back in the  morning She did  to offer any  accommodation or anything.  American Airlines said  I can re route it for  Saturday morning but  I did not  offer any accommodation. I ended up  doing my own car rental and  flying from Phoenix , California in  that middle of  a night since  I was not  possible to resolve  the issues with  the airlines."

9.0,"Rome to London. One of the best European airlines to travel with  on short haul  flights The online website is very clear and easy to use. Check-in procedure was smooth. The gate was very close to the shopping area. Boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge. The only negative aspect is  when you will need to pay  with a drink, as they don’t serve anything free  on all European ."
2.0,"Welcome to Gatwick  in economy class with an silver status BA card. No online check-in  (  BA  system suggests passenger  should arrive at the airport 3 hours before flight , but airport check-in (the only available option) starts  3 hours before . No lounge  access (there is a lounge in  every terminal open to other airline customers, except BA).  No priority boarding for Business and  Economy level passengers. Boarding the plane  via bus. Not  having free water on board in economy."
1.0,"Tampa to Gatwick.  I paid to have my seats  bumped up to  first class and when I got to the airport they wouldn't let me on the flight because someone on their side  showed up when they booked my  tickets so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for  one hour telling  us they can't do anything and  I can't get on the plane. They waited till  that very last second before the  call in period closed to reissue my tickets and won't reimburse me for the seats that I paid for, but never received. "
10.0,"London Heathrow to Madrid. I travel from LHR regularly.  UK Airways have  shown to be reliable and their service is of good quality. As a frequent traveler, I've been able to use the  automatic boarding and also managed to get exit row seats. This airline  is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members. The lounge at Heathrow Terminal  2 is also very good and  provides a good  variety of food and refreshments. The bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft  serve available. I'm very happy with  this airline service and would definitely recommend British Airways. Keep it up guys."
1.0,"Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently  returning from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport  to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea  after I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through  BA exec Club  Economy with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has  now made money by selling our  seat to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen  significantly over the last few years. BA is now  running a low cost airline, flying  a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the  near term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline  if you possible can. And the final insult in  booking premium seats  from BA is that you get  only £40 to pre reserve in  Standard and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't  need to stay in business."
9.0,"It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be  mean and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the  start of arriving  at London Heathrow  airport the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester , the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get  water On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The  size of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm  just 3ins and the headrest can be slid up  far enough too. The entertainment system,  though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good  selection of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow  a ways, and the pilots kept  us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA. Is  it because competition is hotting up and BA now have to try harder?"
5.0,"London Heathrow / Pisa return. My  wife and I  fly this route  three times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The  biggest miserable rip off for a business class seat  on the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route  so high as  our return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you  have the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at  the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really !) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three  chairs for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad  and wine. On the way back - a ploughman's  - it was okay-ish. As a  60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US,  Asia and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think  I know a  lot about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA.  One week when  I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors.  So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would  look larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration.  There would be a nice centre  of Charge ports  for phones/laptops. Headsets.  Wide screens mainly for news - but some movies  and flights over 2 hours. Extra  amount of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And  they probably sell it at £25  a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On  my way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big  issue Clearly some passengers were worried we were on <mask> duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful <mask> and explained he was only <mask> a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took <mask> 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. <mask> in both directions were very good."
3.0,Edinburgh to Boston via London. The planes are ancient and need to be replaced. If these were cars they would have an antique plate. The seats are  old and worn. There is no lumbar support. The space between the  person in front and your face is inches. It’s  almost claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and  very limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores  are much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR  from EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to  ED who was snippy to passengers  who seemed put out by needing to do her job. Boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before  their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board. British Airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing.
3.0,"Flight to Mauritius. My wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding  the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning  we had the  original seat row and number but without the additional ! My formal complaint to BA  have been met with what can  only be described  to condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund  our seat booking ! We feel  like this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It  did help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward  flight was filthy dirty. The return  flight had numerous  minor defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of  other minor airworthiness  problems (I am a licensed engineer).  The marketing email in celebration of 100 years of  flying has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then  let me off with nothing in return. British Airways you are a disgrace, get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for."
10.0,"Coming out of Heathrow on 22nd  March to New  Delhi 20 mins  into our flight  time we noticed  the Tv's weren't working (4 travellers) but I have  gotta say the  flight crew managed  to reset them  so they we  were working within  an hour. The  point for reviewing this is how  good the crew  was The crew  for this flight  was amazing, nothing was too much , Thank you to all involved on that flight."
1.0,"On flight BA  via Gatwick to  George Town and Iberia on the  BA I am  about 5'2"" 8st  row and I  found the leg way too cramp. The onboard flight  control system was  off on the BA flight most of the time.  This was probably  about the last 2 hours of  the flight before  someone managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed  on a loop. The food was  not edible. Coming  down on Iberia the entertainment system  was better and the food was  much better but  the seats legroom was just as  bad I was almost bumped off my connecting flight  with MAD due  ot the lockers being filled up. I had another  reservation to make at LHR and I was not  about to miss  this so I had to insist  they let me  on though loads  more other passengers  being led off. This was the  shortest flight I have flown on. Last long haul BA flight for me."
2.0,"New York to  Paris via London.  I have been  told when around  on aircraft, food,  drinks and information  was deplorable. Booked  economy class. First  flight overnight from  Manchester to Heathrow  is quick, mediocre  shuttle service then  the Chair is  pulled up so  you staring at  a stranger, it’s  awkward and difficult  to maneuver with  clear instructions. Didn’t  call me for  long not sure  why they had  my fill in  my form for  why I wanted  to be woken . No instructions  about the transition  from BA flights.  Now I’m on  BA flight from  Amsterdam to Venice,  no offer of  cold water but  no business class , just coach  and no extra  leg room, just  two seats with  a middle one  spread out.

I  now fly BA  flights "
1.0,"Chicago to London : Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in  the airline industry.  * It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's,  but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of  Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then,  let the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs  like a sleeping , mean feat in the dark. The crew from  Chicago were appalling, and dumped the  food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I  found it uneaten. The lounge at  home was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single,  small TV. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium  air passengers."
1.0,"London to Chicago. Could it get  any worse? The  plane to Chicago was equipped with  your usual ancient  Airbus 747-400. The  British Airways First Class product doesn't  match up to  the Business Class . This particular flight was late  arriving and the  service / wine was simply awful. There is nothing  remotely elegant about  the First Class, and the crew  show no sophistication.  My experience was  like dining at  a worst restaurant ! Finally, not  only is the aircraft tired and  burnt out, but  even in flight  its entertainment system  did not work, and had to  have rebooted twice.  Their First Class  flight is a  total joke, and  extremely uncomfortable. British Airways are at  best twenty years  ahead of date  in their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful. The Concorde First Class lounge  in Heathrow is filthy dirty, and  urgently needs refurbishment."
3.0,"Prague to London Heathrow. Very disappointing service. Cabin crew only managed to  deliver drinks to half the cabin, on a two hour flight that was already delayed  as payment machine was broken, staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on  a trolley. On the bright said,  we did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices."
3.0,"London City to Florence. My flight was at around 7am in the morning. Not only  I got canceled 3 hours before but at the  airport there was no phone line open to call  and manage a rebooking. On their site I had the option to reschedule my flight but I couldn’t select any flights on the same day. Interestingly i was able to find & book  this one through Skyscanner again with BA at the  end of my initial flight with £100 more, of course. Why couldn’t they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page? "

6.0,"Flying to London : Flight on time, not completely , had an aisle seat near back of plane  but the entertainment  was in the  middle Some reviews  say that the last few windows  were blanked off  towards rear of the aircraft but  did so on  this plane. Breakfast  was served which  was OK. Cabin  was mixed, mostly  good and worked . Crew uniform  still looks a  tad tatty compared  to rivals in  that part of  the world. There  is good and bad still with  breakfast - bad  about the so iled chicken wrap  bought just before  departure - leathery and inedible -  rarely do they  put themselves down  after such a  generous offering -  but any passengers  but me could  taste it. Bad  in that there was an old  drink and food  tray in my  back pocket. Good  with the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved.  Flight on time at Heathrow but to a remote  location"

8.0,"On to Seoul. I normally fly  solo but this  was a last  chance flight and  The cost of  it was prohibitive , so I  figured I would  offer World Traveller  Airways a go.  Our cabin is  spacious and intimate  and I was  impressed how roomy  and comfortable the  seats were. The entertainment system was  as well (although  having adverts before  a single showing  was very annoying).  I was happy  with the headphones , small amenity , and felt  the staff were  generally welcoming. My  only complaint was  that slightly pointless  meal we were  serving as for  breakfast neither of  our meals listed  are actually available.  Another similar thing  happened with breakfast,  no options, the  first being the  least appetizing, and no, it hadn't  yet loaded, so  this is an  issue BA might  have to look . All in  All the service  is good and  justified the price.  To ground service  could please at  minimum keep a couple of desks  and people to  settle into before  it puts us  right out of  place"
10.0,"London Heathrow to  New York JFK. Bag drop did not go well. Lounge (galleries north ?) was good and not crowded. Boarding was fine,  no delay, well ! Pre take  out drink was  cheaper than the one i got  from club world 2 weeks previous.  First meal good,  on flight snack , average but my son really  liked it. On time arrival, a good flight. Cabin  crew included some of the older  crew who are  a mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile. I thought  that was a good flight."
5.0,"San Diego to London. From the moment that I boarded this flight  scheduled to take  place at 19.25),  the crew had  zero interest and  purpose only -  To get the  runway lights off, which they duly achieved two hours ! As a  result the service  was negligent in  its extreme. This  being a Club  Med ticket -  quite expensive and  I looked forward  to a decent level of service.  Unfortunately I wasn't offered champagne on  my wine with my meal or  tea and port  after my meal.  We complained to  management when I got home but  most weren't interested and I was  presented with a  lack of corporate  incompetence This flight  is a disappointing  start to what 's been a  wonderful trip to  the US &  UK and has  presented me with  the very poor  impression of the  world"
8.0,"Back to St  John Flew BA  completely revamped business  airline today and  saw huge improvement  over the old  line up. Well lit cabin, improved  seat comfort, better  and operational entertainment  system (always hit  & miss before)  very decent food.  The crew worked  great and were  friendly I have  experienced along with  everybody else the  high standards at BA and have  changed most of  my travel to  budget airlines but  from the basis  from today’s experience I will consider  myself in the . Much improved, well done."

3.0,"Back to Tampa. BA broke my  bag and I did not make  a fuss, I  actually got a  new one. The new one was  too large for  my overhead bin on the return  trip (the only suitcase I could purchase while abroad).  Then on top  with the new  bag I had  TO actually pay BA to check  a new bag.  Hit me over paid for their . They also  turned off customer  support to some  customers abroad. You  might get an email a month  before saying ""I'd  like to know you that we are unable to  provide refund"". Make a big fuss  at the airport if they break  the stuff so  maybe you can avoid this black hole they call  customer service.

2.0,"The husband and  I flew on  UK Airways flight  501 from Baltimore  to London Heathrow  airport on the  14 February 2019. Every aspect of  this flight was  worse than what budget airlines have  to offer. The plane was shabby  or dated. The  seat reclining facility  did not operate  or was not  very comfortable, and  it had less  ventilation than the  standard with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor  was not working . One ear phone on the  plane did not  work The audio  system was too  loud for the  seat so the  headphones kept falling  out making it  difficult to enjoy  any in-flight entertainment  which in itself  was a dated  flight The pillow  smelled disgusting and  kept falling out  from the flimsy  fabric The air  condition lacked consistency  in between very hot and very  hot air. The restroom occupied sign  never lit up  looked vacant even  when it was . However what  made the flight  most unpleasant was  their bad attitude  inside the cabin . They were  extremely unfriendly and quite clearly did 't want to be there. There  is one exception,  one extremely pleasant  female crew member  that greeted us  on and off the flight. There  do not appear  to be any  communication or smooth co-ordination when distributing  the meals. Our  individual trays of food where placed  upon top of  the other and  were thrown at  them by a  sour faced crew member. This flight  was one hour  delayed making us nervous about catching  the connecting flight. There was no  sign or instructions  sent to us about connecting flight  seat numbers before we landed. Unlike  all the other  airline that I 've travelled with  There were no staff member greeting the connecting customers  to point them  in the right  seat or re-assure  me British Airways  may be my  second choice of an airline to  travel with and  i would only  travel with them  once if there  were no other  airline"
3.0,"Welcome to Gatwick. I couldn't imagine that first class on BA would be the same as travelling in  Business class with for example Qatar, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore, Thai etc for double the price. Cabin, seats and  wine equals business class. One of the red wines on the wine  table was out  to start when I left London outbound. Cabin crew  behaved well and gave splendid service. But first class on BA is not worth the fare. When I  went to customer service after I  returned home, all  they got was they are in the process of  a world traveller. "
2.0,"Flight to Athens. Classic BA love  hate hate relationship : one flight  is perfect and  that one is  a total disaster.  Remember in December  2016 at Heathrow , when BA check-in and baggage  and IT systems  were down for  AT least 90 minutes. Total chaos  with people like  myself arrived at  the airport 2:30  mins before the  flight and queuing  with others arriving  15 minutes prior  to their departure  being given priority.  Even though we  were checked in  at some point,  this flight was  extended by 2+  hours on top  with the problems.  Our flight does  NOT have enough  passengers onboard. At least the crew  has attempted to  cut flight time  to the minimum."
2.0,"We booked a  British Airways flight  from Amsterdam to  the Heathrow. In  the beginning everything went normal and  the Check-in and  boarding was easy and on time  and once everyone  entered the problems started one after another. First an  announcement was made  to the pilot  for a flight delay due to  high winds in Heathrow (fair enough).  Once the wind  situation was resolved  and a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out  some luggage. After wards we received  our 3rd announcement  that there is  some computer malfunction  at Schiphol Airport  but they are doing their best to resolve it.  It caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but  I and other  people still remained  happy and relaxed , then the hell started. We  had permission to  get off after  45 mins and  asked the pilot  requested passengers who  did not wish to travel to  leave the plane. Of course there  was many passengers  that were travelling on business and I guess too  busy to make it on time  from their meetings  and they decided to leave. The  pilots warned them  but this might  mean terrible delay  or problems for  some other passengers  and they still decided to leave. So a group  of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then  the pilot announced that we can  get off after  1 or 3 . The flight was full of  unhappy travellers. We  spent 2 hours  sitting in a  flight which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the  aircraft 4 times in total and  neither food or  beverage was offered  for us. We  have to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. The overall experience was  great and it  changed the whole plan for my first day in London."

7.0,"Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first  impression of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good.  I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a  light lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside,  my cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable , reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight."
9.0,Welcome to Tokyo ! My wife  & I treated ourselves to first  economy flights for our holiday to Japan with the  rest of my  parents and a  new Amex companion . We were  so excited about  flying first class  as the dedicated  lounge area at  JFK was great.  I boarded on  time and the  passengers did not . We had  really grand seats  with lovely surroundings.  The cabin staff  which looked after  me were fantastic  they really took  the time to  getting to know  everyone and understand  everything we wanted.  Our food and  the drinks were  amazing I went  with beef main  dish followed by  the amazing chocolate  & toffee pudding.  I was ready to sleep after  eating that food  and saw that  it was lots  more choice and a large screen  for the IFE.  My wife and  myself both said afterwards that it didn't feel like  another long-haul flight  as the time  passed so quickly  and comfortably. My  one complaint is  because the cabin  got uncomfortably hot  when we were  there which made it harder to sleep.

In an act  to desperation I  then called a  different number. The  guy told me  guess what: no  more aisle seats ? Some other  places I tried were available on  Sunday only, good  they know if  you need help  for a Sunday.  But I‘ve got  a strong feeling,  but they do  not even care  about there customers. B On my  trip to San  Jose 5 days  earlier my TV  antenna was gone  so there was  no way to  find seats. Great  flying experience."
9.0,Flying with British  Airlines on numerous  occasions with no  problem However on  1 occasion my baggage was lost  after arrival at  Manchester There was  a British airways  representative at the  luggage claim however  it was a  phone that allowed  me to call  the baggage department.  The lost baggage  is simple and  this bag was  returned on the  return flight to  Singapore which I  found the following  information
1.0,"Flying last Sunday from Geneva to Piladelphia via London  in business class.  As I arrived at the boarding gate in London  to take my  flight to Philadelphia they told me : there was  NO sufficient business  seats available! They overbooked! My choice was then either  either fly ecenomy  or to take the next flight!  they just did not care about  their customer. No phone call, no email, no indication at the lounge nothing until I was at the  boarding gate. I kindly accepted to take the next flight. The plane  is delayed by  1 hour due to technical issues.  Once I arrived at Philadelphia, no suitcase! No British Airways desk on arrival, it was late no one could help. I  would retrieve my suitcase 3 days later: broken! During these 3 days,  It was impossible to get someone on the phone. On my flight back to Geneva, same issue! no sufficient business class seats available. It is clear that this company just don't care about  the customers, they just care about their money !"
7.0,from Heathrow to  Brussels CDG. Quick  and easy flight  into Paris. Took  about 40 minutes  till reach CDG.  Everything went well and the cabin  was very clean.  Only only complaint  was boarding which too way too  slow and was  completely unorganized.
6.0,"Johannesburg to London.  From Johannesburg used  the galleries lounge  which was fine if a little  hot Plane boarded  on time, very hot due to  lack of auxiliary power unit, given  conditions at JNB  every day, perhaps  it could have  that addressed. After take off the crew dispensed with  their dinner drinks  and went straight for meal. Portions of starter very  good I was  sure someone else’s  food mistake which was then taken  back and given  to him. I thought that originally the idea of the new Club house meal involved  the trolley service , no sign  to that. Main  meal good (beef), dessert was cheese,  a small basic . Then bed,  changes in seat made lie flat less comfortable. Breakfast  also ok. Delay with baggage due  to another aircraft technical issue (there  had to be  very few of !). Arrivals lounge  very good. Overall  pretty average experience."
1.0,"London to Bangalore via Heathrow. Rude staff, poor service,  no baggage, poor entertainment system. I spilled my drink and the attitude  of the staff  became brutal. I  begged for my  drink but I  felt made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me. I asked for tissues  but the answer : get it  from the toilet.  Airport staff did  NOT even have the courtesy to  inform me if I needed another  drink once I cleaned myself up. The crew were also extremely noisy. Chatting and laughing loudly at the  whole place for the entire duration. And then - while boarding at Edinburgh, they offered to check in  my second bag , free because cabin was full.  The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow, but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight. 4 hours gap mind you. "
6.0,"Flight to Johannesburg  and London. The short haul flight between Berlin and  Paris was oKay, they don't include  drink or snacks  onboard on short  distance flights and prices onboard for  drinks are compared to some low-cost carriers high. Because of an engine  problem the flights  flight LHR to  London was delayed by 2:45h. British  Airlines gave £5  cash out to  customers for snacks  & drinks. Inside  Emirates A380, the IFE boxes under  rear window seats  made a big  chunk of the  available leg space."
7.0,NEW York JFK to London Heathrow with British Airways. An extremely average flight. Nothing stood  up as good ; nothing stood  just as bad. The flight was smooth and felt quite short. The cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable. The inflight entertainment needed  much work.
4.0,"Have always favoured  US Airways and  I always try  to choose to  fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight  times for my  business travel. I  had always found  much better value  on the cheaper  airlines via their  other benefits like  quick check-in and on-flight catering, for  free However BA have stripped both  these above perks.  I now struggle  to see the  value and put  their offering almost beside that of  the likes of  SAS yet you  get almost double. Then today I  came back from  flying with SAS,  thought it was  cheap and made  to look cheap. Not only do  I get a  full meal on , you get  free drink, can charge your electronics , get wifi  in only 2.9 % Outstanding."
2.0,"NEW York to  Paris via Geneva  on British Airways. The plane was late, not an  inconvenience But some flight attendants were nt really friendly in their manner, they seemed in  no rush to  finish the service  first then chill ... On a 7 hour flight,  they served us the food 40mins  after departure, then  15 at the most after started clearing, we were not even close to finish eating.  And 5 mins after another staff  member just came by an took  some of the food we didnt  really had time to tell him  not to. This was really poor service. Especially to  think that because  this aircraft was only half booked, they were actually rushing us to  being able to  start serving and take a nap  right on the raws of empty  seats next to us. Thats what you call bad customer service! ps:  I was charged 100$ for a  seat after buying  a ticket 350$"
6.0,"Early boarding is always a nightmare,  but it was  worsened on this  trip by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the  crew Fortunately, we  somehow managed to  make off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for  this side of  The First cabin  were personable but  no experience. The food served for  breakfast was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice  with salad is  always a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although  we lack the privacy of competitors'  first cabin. The  bathroom was made redundant because of the typically overheated  seats One of the First toilets was out of action so we  had to make use of the  New World loos . It would  had been helpful  had cabin crew  members apologised for  any inconvenience for the lack of  toilet convenience, but  neither comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality  acceptable if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available  but I didn't  have use of . Breakfast was  light and I wish bread rather than pastries was . Deplaning was  slowed by half-an-hour  due of early  evening congestion at  customs and the  availability of a stand. Overall, a reasonable flight but  not first class."
7.0,"Having 2-3-2 seating  at the front  rows of Club  America on the  flight deck feels  much less cramped  on 2-4-2, but  still showing its  limits in contrast  to other carriers.  A full cabin also means queues  in the two  rows although they're  no lot more  frequent than in  between The drinks  and dinner service  lasted a good  couple of hours, but the revamped  White World food  were definitely an  option The fish  curry for the  second course was  part of the  finest food I've  had in the  flight The White  linen bedding does  manage to cushion  me rather hard . Cabin crew  were generally good  with the CSM  was particularly visible  during the flight.  Service was improved  with the option  of pre-select items.  Everything was ahead  of schedule."
8.0,"Flying to Johannesburg.  We check in via Club World . Fast track  flight was fast  and got to  airport quickly. Lounge  was ok, food  a little better , staff seemed  very attentive. We  was able to  see the spa  which was nice.  Rooms were fine  with no queues.  We left on  board My first  section of the  old Club World  bus which seemed  a go well  was for 5  mins lie flat  and the newer  seating is better  than the older  one which (as  the son says)  have a gap  in stool and  seat sometimes. Crew  in this sector  were good and  The FA serving  the area was  great and it  seemed The CSD  wanted to go  through the motions only. Arrival fine  as baggage was  securely on belt.  A good flight"
9.0,"Flight on 19 Jan. Excellent short flight from Heathrow to Dublin in Club Europe. Cabin Crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent. The Club Europe catering was excellent, I had pre-ordered a gluten-free meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with gluten-free bread. The main course was beef ratatouille with a  small dessert pot. This was the  only inflight meal I've had on a short haul flight. On arrival  in Dublin the ground service from Swissport was poor, it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer (25  minutes for ground staff to open  the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal."
1.0,"Something happened to  The World's Favourite ? Returning from  JFK to Gatwick  I were presented  by a worn-out  BA 777. My  tray table was  damaged with bits  of seat plastic  torn off. I  had to try  and balance the  dinner tray on  my knees so  the the dinner  plate could be kept flat, it  did work, tray  ended up on  my floor with  drinks and food.  Tell this to  Chris who was  quite upset with  the complaint and  assured me 'I'll  read it in  a book'. No  apology no attempt  of explain, just  words from him. The food was  cold neither my  daughter or I  would finish it.  It also seemed  stale with no  tea and biscuits,  so nothing to  eat on the  menu My wife's  laptop screen, didn't  read the passenger  seat to me  and didn't work , mine only  worked intermittently. It  looked liked something  about the Arc  on the grid  and the touch pad clearly visible.  To believe the  flights out of  BA are being  the can't come  home moment too ? We purchased  our Economy tickets  but the this  year we didn't  get a premium , Initially I  considered going to  purchase business tickets , the price  seemed ridiculous so  was glad I  do My frustration with BA grows  each year, we 'll fly with  them now when  I have too."
2.0,"Kuala Lumpur to Miami via London  - business class with British Airways. The business class seats were small for business class and pretty old. The flight entertainment system are outdated. I am not sure how they do the selection , they could do better with the crew selection.  The choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business class. Overall BA have to  do better to be on top of their game. Planes has to be changed."
1.0,"On to Heathrow.  This year they  began boarding flights  into groups.   The week or two after the  complimentary beverages and  drink service disappeared,  and the final  straw in the  book was pay  and choose seating.  We decided no  flying anymore. I  walked away from  using the only  airline I have  and now I  try to maintain  a flyer status  with two or  more separate airlines.  The last flight  was took BA  did use my Avios points and  we literally flew , but never  again use BA ..."
2.0,Return to London.  A breakfast served  me before landing  is terrible. A terrible croissant with  a cream cheese with onions and  some breakfast fruit . It was  served in cellophane.  When anyone ate  that what a  mess
10.0,"Copenhagen to Amsterdam via London Heathrow with British Airways. There was problems at check in  and a lot of people had  to run to make the flight. But the attitude  of welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and I  enjoyed the flight. The seats were  comfortable and comfortable and the aircraft fresh. During the  second flight from LHR to AMS, the expectations from  the first flight  were fulfilled and  we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent  travelers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand. Like how the taxi from Polderban is almost as long as the  plane itself."
3.0,"Welcome to Gatwick.  Usually it is  possible to pay  money to get a decent seat  by priority booking , having paid the full cost of world traveler plus. We checked  out as soon  that the online  checking in was  open to find that only 4 seats (for the  4 of us)  remain unbooked. We  had to take  4 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow  as the economy  seats and 2 on the back row where we  felt constantly bothered by the adjacent . Only 1  in each side between the economy  and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. Cabin  temp was uncomfortably  low overnight temperature  was stifling hot and few people  got any sleep at all. Breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich , a hurried cup of tea  / coffee. Impossible  we get any  food or refreshments  in the service : Tatty seat  with broken foot  and malfunctioning entertainment, broken tables requiring  you to hold  the food and  towels between our knees. When asked  to help the  staff told us  he didn't have  a screw driver to fix these  issues and it  was an old plane with lots  for this type  an issue."
2.0,"To understand completely why there is air rage in  our skies when  firms such as BOAC go out of their way , make the  flying experience an stressful and unpleasant  as is humanly  possible I paid  nothing to fly  from LAX-BUH and yet they want  an extra $150 to have a  free seat. I  understand if you  arrive 24 hours before departure you receive a seat  among those available, but why is it they assign  you the worst seat available when  they are there? In my case, they assigned me a middle seat  for a 787  when both of  which adjacent aisle  chairs are available to assign. It is baffling. The  ground crew and  other inflight staff are excellent but  will do little  with the oppressive  booking decisions their  passengers make -  everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am  not flying BOAC? They owed me £25 from the last flight b/c  my inflight entertainment  centre was inop  2 1/2 the  flight and so  you all had to sit in the dark with  little to do  over a twelve-hour  flight On top  all that, their seats have so  little padding and  fabric that only the plumpest can sit in their  rows longer that 15"". For normal-sized  flyers it is as agonising as the rack must've been. And of  this you only  gain compensation by  paying them again.  Now I know:  having a free  ticket on BOAC  is overpriced."
3.0,"London to Miami.  The long haul business class. That  huge divider, the ridiculous fold down footstool and the  cut out seats!  Customer service is  horrible unless they  are serving you  your meal. If you want a snack or drink  get out your  bag and hunt  down a cabin  where they don’t ask you if you need anything between meals. The  toilets are dirty and basic. I’m  the Gold Member  for giving it  over to fly other more updated airlines. They’ve crammed as many business  grade seats as possible at the expense of comfort  so it’s not like they’re cheap."
7.0,"I used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy. They  had a wider seat and a  lot more inches leg room. Boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty  more overhead locker space, water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne. The staff were well turned out but rushed, as the  premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew.  A hot meal was served an  hr after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate  cake and biscuits & cheese. Quality red and white  wine was served.  My inflight movie selection was OK. A light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea. Getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto  my plane to inspect all passports. Not my best ."
5.0,"It was fairly  easy the well  thought out staff  had got people  on board and  things stored. I  was lucky that  this one was  right next me,  and I had  no more room.  Every pre take  out drink was  red or orange .  Within  the hour of  setting off a  great meal of  chicken - salad was served with  some good dessert.  Food selection was  mostly American with  some wines. The  food selection was  - The PE  boxes are more  economy than economy,  the extra 4 cm of width  makes a huge  difference The 2nd meal on this  day was a  couple of crisps  and cookies. "
2.0,"Bangalore to London.  Travel experience not great - at  first automated bag  check didn't work  but it wasn't clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to India needed to be validated. At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various  parts of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling   and latches for bassinet shelves not  on Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent,  though this comes  without the hassle  from not being  permitted to leave  everything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept  checking the VOD  on and I'm quite slim), recline  more and footrest could extend more. No USB power  on seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself  is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low  or visible gridlines  with very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped  working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that. Food volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg. Insufficient lavatories for Premium Economy and Economy."
1.0,"London to New  Jersey via London. I was in  NYC for just  four days so  made one small  problem which they  directed me to . My flight  to Barcelona to  NYC was delayed  causing  passengers to miss their  flight When I  first got a  ticket we taxied  for an hour  and then were  told we needed  ot return to  the gate as  our luggage was  loaded incorrectly. It  took me nearly  two hours to  go from Barcelona  via JFK.   When I arrived, my luggage wasn't  there so I  filed a claim.  We called and  tried every day  but they couldn't  find it even  if I had  a tag number  information and documentation.  Three days later,  they finally contacted  them and gave  me a six  day window for  the delivery. The  real insult is  because I was expected to file  the claim for  a missing personal  belongings within seven  months As a  result they have  left me no  compensation for damages. </s>"
3.0,"Gatwick to Fort  Lee Charging to  book seats, even within 24h prior  take off, is  costly So if someone decides to  take only hand  luggage one cannot  find a seat  without paying extra charges?"
1.0,"I recently flew  from London to Bologna, the aircraft  being full and  I requested that  everyone place their  own bags into the hold with checked in luggage  to save space.  So we did,  when we arrived my carry on  bag which has  taken me on many flights over  these past 3  months was damaged  to beyond repair or use for our further journeys.  Well I approached  our damaged/lost baggage  and lodged a  complaint and provided all the evidence,  stating that we  are continuing to travel and needed  to replace the  bags asap. I  was advised by the representatives to ring BA service . Made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was  needed and did  that and submitted a claim. Well it is still  here despite replacing  the bag with a cheaper version  the total cost  had not been refunded. They instead  told me to produce receipts from  2 years ago  and then offered  refund half the money due to depreciation. Despite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the money they refused  the refund."

4.0,"Back to Bucharest. First class ground staff but in the air it's  always a disappointment.  Our basic economy  seats have so  no cushion it is agony to  fly for longer  then 15"" in them. And £1.95  for a can  of coca-cola? "
1.0,"I forgot I had purchased a  full baggage only fare. At the airport I was charged more than  100 euros for my bag which came out as almost as much  as the fare  itself cost. The staff at check-in  would not have  looked less helpful. The whole experience was of a  typical low-cost airline. Boarding process saw  people in Category  B having to  arrive last, not  so much as a glass of water is offered.  All seats have  precious little legroom and just one toilet for the  premium economy cabin. com"
6.0,"If the passenger in front reclines his/her seat, it  made it very  easy to get  up and out  from one's seat.  Because the arm  rest do not  open all the  seats up, the  back seat passengers have to climb over. There is  little leg room  or no leg room The Boeing  737 IFE screen is smaller than  the ones on  The British Airway's 747-400s and could  cope with an  upgrade The saving  point on this  trip was the  excellent service from  the dedicated and  very professional flight crew."
5.0,"Flying to London.  Nice Traveler seats.  No headrest. Legroom  good but overall , cramped especially when the passenger  up front reclines his/her seat. The  chair back was  cramped in my  lap making it  difficult to read  the Airways' magazine or even use  the iPad. We  ordered special meals  fast and low . The Muslim  dinner (chicken tikka  served with naan)  is restaurant quality.  Simple and not  overly hot. The  spicy jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like mom's. The  lower sodium meal  with herb roasted , tomato rice,  cooked broccoli, diced  red pepper and  cheese was delicious.  Lunch consisted of  dried blueberries and  spinach The IFE  were very good.  Full and clear  LCD screens with  the good selection  of entertainment and  information in several  areas "
3.0,"London to Athens. We were fortunate to get exit row seats in  Athens They were spacious with plenty of legroom. They had more width than the cramped Boeing 747-400 that we had just flown in on. We each had a carry on; however, during the transit process, British Airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags.  And I have  an idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on bags. Bare bones service, no meals (which is okay), no complimentary soft drinks , water. Bottled water was available  upon purchase. In hindsight, we would have been better  off flying on Aegean Airlines."
10.0,"London to Johannesburg. So impressed by  this lady that  checked us in. Something went wrong with my booking, I was supposed  to fly at  21 (with my  parents back home  in South Africa after our visit in UK, but somehow my ticket  got booked at 21:10. We didn’t even notice that until she had  looked it up  during the check-in. I was so shocked by the fact that I would be traveling  completely by myself , my first trip overseas). She was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of 1 minute. We obviously thought , we would not be able to sit next  one each other. With grateful hearts we were checking  out our bags. When she gave  me our boarding passes she mentioned  that we have the best seats on the aircraft! How awesome is ? Thank you British Airways and their helpful staff."
7.0,"London to Bangalore  Airport via London  on BA premium  economy (World Traveler  - I paid  about 40% more  than premium economy , $600 extra)  or approximately $150  each leg. Was  it worth it?  To say broadly yes, though I  did want to  spend very much  higher than that  and it would  be harder to  do if only  a leg of  4 hours was involved. Before Boarding:  BA economy does  include a standard  one checked bag  - whereas economy  allows 1 bag , there are  several exceptions where  they allow 2 . India to  Bangalore is one  one those exceptions  and it isn't  sure if it  is for travel  purposes at either end). So I 'm not sure  if I got  the extra bag  or not but I did use  a 2 bag  Before Boarding: You  are in Zone  1 after First/Business  on the oneworld  - That is  good as you  will get dibs  at the overhead  luggage - if  it doesn't fit  into premium economy  they can always  put it in  before or behind  once economy begins ). This means  you also get  onboard fairly quickly , which can  help if you're  in a hurry to get through  security at Heathrow , a connecting  airport or through  customs at your  next destination. In  Economy There is  a welcome drink  - premium economy  - juice, water depending on the  travel time). There  is also a  tea towel service ! 787 cabin: The 787-9 has  a nicely done  Premium economy cabin.  Limited seating as  standard to 3-3-3  in economy. So a somewhat wider  seat Seat pitch  but also decent.  These are new  slightly slimmer seats though possibly less  so than what you get on  Economy seats -  each seat was comfortable. The food  bag comes out of the armrest  and there is  some seat back storage (though not !). There is  also small drinks  stand built into  a front of  each arm rest which you share  with your neighbor.  This is a  leather style footrest with support for  the calf. You  do get a noise canceling headset  this is nice  with a basic  boot kit with  some socks and . The seat 's screen is  nice and easy  in use. There  was no restroom  within the cabin  except one immediately  available in economy - so not a long walk . cabin: 777  has a 2-4-2  cabin in premium  economy (same as  the world) as  opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used  in the LHR-BLR  also has a  rather small premium  economy cabin -  with 3 rows  4 seats. This  made it a  lot of cosy  - You do  have to walk all the way <mask> the economy <mask> immediately behind <mask> to get <mask> the restroom. <mask> looked pretty <mask> on both the legs on <mask> 777 but premium economy was <mask> full - <mask> I had <mask> seat next <mask> me vacant <mask> both legs. <mask> helped me <mask> out for <mask> The seat <mask> screen on <mask> old 777 <mask> much smaller <mask> the seats are older but <mask> more cushioned <mask> the slimmer <mask> seats. Food: <mask> much here. <mask> didn't think <mask> was all <mask> different from <mask> a regular economy meal would <mask> been. It <mask> OK - <mask> to write <mask> about. All <mask> all, for <mask> a long <mask> the premium economy product did <mask> some additional <mask> along with <mask> early boarding <mask> baggage. Worth <mask> on extra <mask> haul like <mask> to India. <mask> harder to <mask> on shorter <mask> or fewer <mask>"
1.0,"Flying to Berlin  Airport for 21st  November On approach  at the airport,  i got a  message saying that  a flight was  cancelled No explanation  were given. As  we arrived at  Berlin airport, staff acted very confused  They said their rerouting center is closed for the  holiday due to  Christmas and if I wanted to  travel in the  two days ahead of Christmas I should book my own travel with  an airline or  tour company (e.g.  ) My costs  will  be ) The airport staff also said  no further help  from British Airways  not available on  the day to due airport issues.  I felt the only way out  were to rebook  travel with a  different airline for a hefty +300  extra fare for  the short haul  travel for the  next day. As  this was Christmas,  passengers were very  busy After I  arrive at my  destination a lengthy  exchange of messages with British Airways  ended and British Airways said in  they end they  would not compensate  passengers for rerouting with a different  company (opposite to  everything their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).

10.0,"Welcome to Mumbai. I have had  many battles with the leadership at BA because they  did not let me book my  flights and pay with their Airmiles. Now they have  kindly relented and this will please many who earn Airmiles through their credit cards. This is just to illustrate that I boarded BA199 with a slightly negative  attitude a mindset which was changed quickly. Although I travelled Economy, the  accommodation was comfortable, the service excellent, as was the  quality If I have a minor  and the choice  to films seems to have been  compromised with many quite old. Is this BA's attempt to reduce costs, because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product. I was particularly impressed  at the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use  containers (e.g. water bottles, duty-free carrier bags) into the  airport where they could result in a stiff fine. Having been grumpy about several aspects  about BA's service  over the past, I will be  speaking to the leadership to thank them for the improvements."

They said  I would contact  their customer services on our behalf  to complain and  would expect more  money than what  their crew could  get us. By  The time we  finally got off  a plane and  sat in baggage , I had  not received an  apology from BA , and that they would respond within 48 hours,  which they did.  However all the  staff offered was  the £20 voucher  to use on  a BA flight.  BA replied declining  this and said  this was as  compared to what  I had originally  booked for the  vouchers and explained  all the cabin  crew had said.  I also said  I had no  intention of booking  the foreseeable flights  with any airline  that an eVoucher  seemed worthless to . There was  little other alternative  to any means  beyond reasoning. The  food was basic  but the seats  extremely uncomfortable. BA  did offer WiFi  onboard the plane but when you  decide to use  them they charge  extra per hour  in economy class."
8.0,"I had flown  UK Airways from  Leeds Bradford to  Birmingham Heathrow as  as part of  a journey back  home (Thailand) on  Wednesday 12th December , I arrived  at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early  so there wasn't  much queue at  the check-in counter.  The process took  less than a  week as I  have done online check-in, this means  we just dropped  my luggage. The  staff at the airport were very  nice and helpful.  They passed through  airport security control  and waited for my aircraft. Boarding  early is a  nightmare as there  is priority boarding  I flew economy)  or no boarding  but luckily every  passenger could board  at front and  back door (as  my aircraft parked  was a remote . The aircraft  looked old but  its cabin was  spacious and clean.  The seat was  nice and had  the good wing view. The only  issue was the  flight was the  first to last  seat at the  time so the  flight pitch was  higher (luckily I  was only 176m  away so this  was a problem).  The aircraft was  late due to  the boarding process , the weather  condition but the  crew were very  nice and very  friendly The captain  could announce an  order for whole  aircraft to let  the passenger know  their cause of  delays and flight ! As the  plane departed the  passengers started on  customer service. I  could buy anything  as the food  quality was poor,  expensive and they  could only be  paid by credit ! It was  3 hour flight  and I didn't  have the top  class standard. The  aircraft arrived at  London Heathrow on  time despite some  delays Overall, the  good service and  crew made this  journey enjoyable and  could improve this  the food and  the boarding process  could be better."
7.0,"Return to Tenerife.  That aircraft either  needed a refit  or needs retiring!  This is by  FAR the most  uncomfortable plane I  have ever been ! I paid  extra for an  additional leg room  seat - 12A  and I always  was happier without  my knees under  the chin for  the four hour  flight I reckon  I was no  less than half  and hour into  the flight that  a total lack  in padding on  my seat turned  this flight into  another ordeal. It 's like sitting  under concrete! I  can imagine that  on this aircraft  arrived new (2005  I believe) the  external seating was  very yielding and  soft but now  after thirteen years  of backsides compressing  without padding, it 's dreadful. I  take the precaution  by changing my  clothes for the  day and sneaking  into a seat  I purchased in  London which, coupled  by there being  two passengers next  of me, made  a flight in  general a little  less bearable. Staff  was fine on  the outward leg  but a little  better by the  time I returned  one night ten days later. I  did travel Easyjet on this route  and on this  flight I used  an Avios to  avoid the flight  too expensive. Easyjet  offers two trolley  bags but only 1 on these  short flights. With  my diminishing attitude  toward customer welfare,  we will not  fly BA on any lengthy flights  because the service  and comfort offered  to Easyjet is,  from my experience,  vastly superior.

1.0,"Book a flight  with Expedia for  seat 21019 from  Boston to Paris  from London on  a promise that  I could upgrade  my Avios. After  taking the flight and trying to  book was notified  that I could  not upgrade the  seat due to  how I purchased  a ticket, paid  about $250 for  a seat selection  on both flights,  to buy up  at the front  of the plane,  then notified that  the seats were  going to the  rear of the  flight with no  change - but  turns out they  sold the seats,  ones I paid  money for, to  third party. Could  offer a refund, but wouldn't honor  anything they had  charged me in  the first place.  Then would not  issue a refund either. Then I  fell ill and they chose not  even refund my  balance of $3380  I paid for . "
1.0,"Welcome to London.  I had a  good seat on  an upper deck.  My only advantage  is that nobody  can step over  it during the  flights BA has  been using the  standard configuration of  seats in business  in the last  20 years, and  there is time  for them to  clean up their  game if they  are to keep people flying with  them The business  level seat is  actually wider than  in premium economy , the difference is that it  opens to a  twin bed. There  was no room  either to put  up a glass , then taking  to the table. As it was  a late flight , the crew  opted not to  serve pre-dinner drinks.  We ordered the  light meal option  an order to  have more sleep. Big mistake: you  could get the  soup (tiny) and  no desert (even !). I was  not hungry and they refused to  serve me my  favourite dish as  we reserved it  from the crew.  The trays are  empty when everyone  finally finishes, so much for getting  some sleep. The  drinks never came  out until breakfast.  My flight was  a total disappointment."
1.0,"London to Kuala Lumpur. This is my first time  flying with BA to Kuala Lumpur on the Dreamliner 787. Was very excited for this  journey as BA has made a  switch back to  service to Malaysia after stopping the  service for many years. I paid  a seat at the first row to have a longer leg room.  Was absolutely regretted and disappointed for  that choice. I  had a complaint  with the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this  one for the next 13 hours.  They only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all  seats 30 as  the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time. This will be my last time flying with BA unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps  an A380. I am dreading on my next return flight back to  Malaysia Crews were friendly and helpful. No fault with that."
4.0,"Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Very  bad customer service.  When checked in  two hours prior  of my flight , asked   if I have aisle seat and  they just said no. I asked  her why and she replied that  they don’t have  one In the  bathroom there is  one place for  your bag and the staff said  yes sir we  do have space  so you can put that underneath  your seat. They served dinner and  then we don’t  need any more chicken so you  should have pasta. I told him  I don’t like  pasta and do  we have any  other food. He  said the pasta  was vegetarian. "
1.0,My flight from Seattle to London in November 6th  is canceled due to technical problems. After waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the BA  staff couldn’t find us any immediate flight. They offered us a flight  that would arrive  from London late  November 8th. It would take us 16 hours. Since  the purpose of trip was to  present a paper in a conference in November 8. I would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive. My trip was  going to be 4 days so  at the time of arrival I  planned to return in less than two days. They advised us to  take the flight and promised to  pay our flight tickets as well as the expenses  of our accommodation  but it was to late to cancel our booking. I filed a claim online based  upon their instruction.  The customer relation phone number is disconnected. In fact the automatic voice mail says : don’t chase a call”! The website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not . After 1.5  hour stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by  email to tell  them that we are not going to receive any refund from them. .
6.0,"Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December  & back on  the 17th Dec. It started well  at the newish 1st Class lounge  at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal,  as this flight  used to operate  in is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a  good deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how  poorly the ""new"" 1st Class is  made up. There  are scuff marks . Surface scratches.  Plenty of wear on the seat ! It's probably  been 5 years ' use but looks more like ... In the WC there are  big cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least.  Some motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago  and save costs,  then re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat  being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have  tried both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining.  For one meal;  BA starts with an Amuse Bouche.  The motley round mozzarella bit of . One tomato.  A bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped  up with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then  ordered jerk Chicken dish. It was  all about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay.  Our cutlery was poor quality, the  stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I  think we are stuck with this  cheap product for the next 30 yrs or so, but there is so much BA could do to  improve the ""cheap""  part of their premium product. Quality , presentation, food, champagne, even the  pillow covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand  Blanc champagne, which  starts at £120 a bottle. Its  nice but we  all know this is inferior to  the most Airline 1st Class offer <mask> Krug. £20 <mask> bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business <mask> in the <mask> I'm a <mask> and i know I could run this airline <mask> from a <mask> perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of <mask> BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. The FAs as always were a very nice bunch <mask> men and women."
10.0,"Welcome to London.  In first class ! The Moscow  airport was surprisingly  comfortable with excellent  sea views. Quick boarding, and I  was escorted to  a seat by  my crew. The new First seats on the 787-9 ER are a  great upgrade from  the older product.  With plenty of  room a cupboard  with several little storage bins in addition to the  usual bin space.  A 23 inch  LCD IFE screen  provided brilliant picture  clarity and the  sound quality was  superb thanks to  onboard noise cancelling . The dinner menu was extensive , the food  is the best airline meal I've  experienced Drinks were  quickly topped up  after boarding to  London The crew  was very attentive , friendly with it. A fantastic  flight and I'll  look forward to  my next opportunity to fly in  the cabin."
4.0,"Return to London . For supper  we asked for  sugar / hot  water to make milky drink as  i don't drink  milk or coffee  on health reasons. Given with no  response For breakfast I requested the  same and I was refused. I  replied I don't drink tea or  milk but milk  and water."" We  can keep hot water, I can get it once we have finished serving all other  passengers That never came until the lady had to  been called to take care of the unwell passenger.  He kept my sugar, milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays  from breakfast for the warm water, explaining I have  tea waiting. He said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back. I felt like a nuisance,  just ignored and  cannot bother anyone  until the flight started being bumpy in preparation for  the"
1.0,"Back to Gatwick. Booked our return  flights in Business/Club  class (at £1,000+ ), only to  discover BA want  us charge an  additional £80 each to choose our seats.  Awful  flight with their  assigned seating arranged  as sardines in  a tin. Poor  cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat  too be made  directly into an  area only to  being told ""We  cannot do that in First class  and if we  do that for  you we would  have to do  it for everyone  in the cabin  but we do  not have the  time for that"".  It was almost  relieved when I  was disturbed by  something being passed  from the serving  seat (otherwise known  to a privacy ) to the  next seat -  it happened 3 times, a sort a sleep deprivation ! If you  are expecting business  trip levels of  sleep and the  chance to sleep  over an overnight flight you will  leave sadly disappointed."
8.0,"Chicago to New York via London.  My flight from  LA to LHR  went ok. I  did miss the  continental breakfast on  Saturday morning flights! We left on  schedule and arrived  within plenty of  hours to make our connection to JFK. On the  connecting flight the  service was fantastic.  The meal was  good and we  got offered plenty  free drinks throughout  our flight. We  landed and arrived  in time. The seat and legroom was fine. My  friend IFE didn't  fit and she was moved seat,  something she appreciated.  My cabin crew  is very friendly."
2.0,"Flying to London via Singapore. I'm hugely disappointed with the Business class trip. The seating  choices leave little  to be desired, i.e. if you  are on the isle you're interrupted  as the cabin  staff passing food through to or  removing the tray from the person  directly on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you're next to the window,  they need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as  your have to climb over someone  else in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar  may not be  very appealing if they tried and  bad luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the  tray type surface  to spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started  about the in-flight entertainment or the  quality of it. After I watched  three movies (on  a 24 hour ) I was scratching to find  something else decent  could watch. The  term releases"" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately  had to join the queue to  get with the rest of economy.  If you locate your seat you  find all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats.  I would not recommend BA to anyone."
6.0,"On to London. In contrast to  an excellent outbound experience, inbound lacked the wow factor.  The cabin was full and dominated  by a few  people who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance.  The crew were  polite rather than . The dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the  flight board had shrunk in size  between the two flights. My IFE touchscreen struggled to respond to finger  gestures and the  quality of films  were no different to the previous month. Sleep quality was reasonable, although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant. Breakfast  was pretty good. Arrival was on time and we  felt relieved to find that our  bags had made their way from a domestic Comair flight."
2.0,Got to Gatwick.  Out of the  flight business class ! Entertainment system  to work and  ask the crew  for solution and  their reply was sorry sir there  was no solution.  Had super slow  landing crew to  feed 48 business class passengers. Food  is beef over  potatoes mashed potatoes  rice and salad . Nobody from  our crew to  remind us to  make our bed.  Wake up 20min  before landing and  ate a yogurt.  :)
1.0,"On to Barbados.  First class was  first rate. A  filthy cabin, crumbs  on the seat,  wet carpets and  black marks over  remote controls -  this looked as  tho it hadn't  got properly cleaned  in days. Poor  ventilation and an  operating system from  very different age.  We have avoided  flying with BA  for the last  10 years, now  to remember why.  Avoid them if  my route allows."
2.0,"Our Town to London. Very unimpressive amenities and service. Unless you have a bulkhead seat, there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you. There is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above. The food was at  least pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to . My husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn't get the attention of steward to rectify (I gave him one of the two sets on mine). I, on the other hand never got the main course. I finally went and  ordered and it was delivered cold and over-cooked."
1.0,"Back to London.  Airlines are not giving free food  & drinks anymore, you have to  be on short . In Bucharest they did not park at the  airports they shuttle  you to and  from the plane  on the bus.  We are charging for checked luggage  they ask people to check their  own luggage because  some flights are  too busy'. Avios 's reward points  to buy you a lot less than it used , I have  no problem with  them turning into  another budget airline,  they at least  price accordingly, otherwise,  that feels like  you being scammed."
10.0," Kuala Lumpur to Mexico City via  London The journey  of Malaysia to Mexico alone for  the trip would  sound very boring.  But during my  journey from London  to Mexico City  on 2 Dec  2018 it is  very interesting with the cabin crew  and me, especially  travelling with Muslim  people on food. They are polite and talk to  us with big  smile So, when  i returned back  from Malaysia and  arrived in London  and Mexico City  from 5 Dec 2018, I wished  we will be able to meet them again. Hope to see this  amazing cabin crew  together again in  the next trip."
1.0,"London to London.  You are going  well . Having  been offered chicken  choice of vegetable  options on the  previous journey, the  experience was exactly  exact same this  time  I  said to the  staff that I  really like either  food and was  also possible to  order a salad  and some soup  from another class . I was  told by an  incredibly rude steward  if I could  take it or  eat it basically.  She said I  should have put  my requests on  your account but  they can’t account for having the  first two options every time you  go and wouldn’t  allow them only  to have two !  The snack before landing  is the most  expensive bagel/bun. Totally  disgusting and as  with the attitude  from the staff,  made a bad situation worse. The  lights didn’t work  on my seat  and I couldn’t  see once the  power went off , the screen  got so damaged  and my TV,  I was incredibly  frustrating Entertainment having  been four times  the last month,  and have barely  realised I won’t  bother travelling with  you again if at all possible."
10.0,"I would like  too compliment British Airways and their  team for the  professionalism of the  flight service from  our crew and  excellent food served.  On landing we  was served with  delicious afternoon tea , that was  great credit to  their catering company.  What a very  pleasant flight from  London Gatwick to  Birmingham"
2.0,"Arrived at the  terminal to discover  my flight had been delayed by several hours. During this time no  additional information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to  confirm the delay) or elsewhere at  that airport. Over an hour after the flight should have taken off,  shortly after most  people had purchased  fuel an announcement was made that each passenger would  become entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no  snacks were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. No complimentary  meal or drink was provided on  time to make  pay for the delay. We landed at Gatwick minutes  after the last train left, meaning  we then had to shell out £50 for a  flight home. Despite this, BA refused to pay any  penalty as the delay was less  that three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took  nearly a month to respond to  a request about it. This airline has been going downhill for several  decades but this experience cements BA's transformation into an  evil EasyJet. Will not fly with them again."
1.0,"we have been loyal customers with British Airways since  she was a  small girl. Every  October we booked airline tickets with this company to  see my grandparents in Italy. On  August 17th I booked 3 airline  seats to visit  my grandparents leaving October 31st coming back November 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to  travel On October 19th my grandfather passed away. We  put in a cancellation/refund request because  our sole purpose  were to see him one last time. As British Airways did refund  us for our tickets but refused to refund us  all of our seats even though we never used their services. This has been frustrating to deal with  in top of the loss of my grandfather. In addition, every employee  i have spoken to on the phone had probably  THE worse customer service experience I’ve ever encountered.  I am beyond  disappointed with this company and neither my family nor  friends will fly  with them in  any future. "
7.0,"Gatwick to Las Vegas. Boarding by group number seemed  too work well  for Gatwick, we  took off ahead  on schedule and  flights commenced about  20 min after  take off. The  crew seemed relaxed and happy and  as well as  their team. BA have improved their inflight menu and  menu shows as  they quality of  the food was  part of the best I’ve ever  experienced on a  short haul flight.  Our aircraft was old and dated  as the IFE  was a throwback  to the 90’s with unresponsive touch  controls and hard to watch quality  as we all  get used to  high quality these . All in all a very  enjoyable flight."
3.0,"Nassau to London. Premium Economy on BA is a joke. Highlighted by  a Friday morning 7am breakfast. A glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in  chocolate Croissant and an equally sealed  French Bread/Cake. No  other food/drink; awful.  Finally after a night battling with  poor service on the seat back  and  a  seat no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money  is early off  the plane with  bags prioritised to  baggage collection area. The extra leg room was about OK but the  flight was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. BA Premium Economy , forget it. Other airlines do this better."
9.0,Phoenix to Accra  from London. I  received a great  room service treatment  at the check  in at Phoenix  by the young  woman who checked  you in. She  was very professional  and handled my  check in process . My entire  experience was great . I really  got treated very  well also on  my final leg  from Accra by  our BA staff  at London as . Just want  to appreciate this  kind of professionalism  of the staff.
3.0,"Manchester to London. The bag drop process took an hour even though I had checked  it already. The  staff offered little apology, explaining that  I was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about . Staff on  my flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology. Another flight attendant didn’t bother to  tell customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments. Not exactly best of British, and I’ll certainly not be recommending!"
2.0,"From Diego to  JFK via London.  Originally booked on  for the longer  flights both ways in premium economy.   On the  plane I was  informed at San  Francisco that the  BA Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and  i would miss  the flight into  Houston American Airlines  did book me  on a later  flight the same  time but had  no  coach .. If I  booked on premier  class I could  return in 3  hours I took  a coach and  I assured my  that BA would  pay the fare  back for this . After arrival  at home I contacted BA on  their website to  check the fare .. A bizarre  conversation followed. First  it said you  could not buy  this upgraded seat.  I told them  they look at  my ticket. You  cannot get a  discount because the  business class seat  was much more  costly that the  new premium economy . I contacted  Air Germany who  says you get  the refund, but  they booked this  on a travel  company so we 're not in  Europe  I  settled with BA  on their website. They saidthey would  fax this to  them so they  can compute the  price but then  you can't get  the refund because  the seat was  significantly more expensive  than the premium  and you booked  on in advance.  My change in  fares was the  sole fault of  the delayed American  Airlines flight. This  a miserable customer ."
1.0,London Heathrow to  Munich Absolutely disgusted  by BA. my  son was asked to put his  large piece of hand luggage in the hold due  the the flight being busy and  gladly agreed. BA  has one job  can do -  put it in  the hold and make sure it arrives in Stuttgart.  This has proven  incredibly difficult. The  baggage is lost  but they have  never offered any assistance or support.
9.0,"Welcome to Johannesburg.  Going right to  a first wing  on T5 was  no new experience  with us. It  was all pretty  straightforward although the guy at check-in  not exactly Mr  Right The Concorde  itself was impressive,  too - particularly  its terrace with  its quirky interior  windows overlooking the  entire concourse. Boarding  meant lining up  group to group.  I smacked a  bit of low-cost  luggage but I  guess that's necessary  with all the  seats on a  commercial plane. The  executive cabin on the A380 is  considerably more spacious  when on a  777 and the  cabin also had  extra room and  more storage space.  Seat dividers seemed  good too, giving  us privacy. The  idea that the  flight was only  halfway full was  another bonus. Cabin  crew were friendly,  attentive and thoroughly . Food was  good too, and  shows that airline  food can be  about restaurant quality  and the cabin  should use reheating  facilities properly. The  wine on offer  had a good , including the  best LPGS, and  we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably  worse than Club  Economy although the  cabin temperature was  a little high. Overall, an excellent flight that fully  enjoyed the brief  days first class travel."
2.0," Having booked BA  First Class and  charged extra for  window seat selection  on the Boeing 787, I was disappointed to have the flight re-scheduled.  We rejected BA's offer of flying on Belgian Air  and had to  miss my flight  or get a  second BA aircraft.  As I booked in the window seat selections had been lost. My husband and I were forced to  sit separately. At the booking in  I was told that they could  not find ""proof""  where I had  asked for selected seats. I could  never prove the  booking because the  seats number had changed with the new flights. Spooning  to a stranger in the centre isle was not  the trip I planned. On the  return flight (again, sitting apart from my husband) my  experience did not ! The staff  would not have  sounded nicer, but could not find  another alternative seat.  On return, BA  customer complaints offered a £400 voucher  for my next flight. Despite sending  them detailed messages, I received the same response. Completely inadequate service by BA (not the  flight attendants) in delivering the flights  I paid for and dealing with the complaints."
7.0,"Vancouver to London  - I chose to fly with them because I  had been told  they were good for families and as I was  travelling with my 8 month old alone this was  what I needed. The booking process  was not smooth  or very stressful,  you have to  contact customer service multiple times and  they need to improve their customer  support call center. The 2 flights  went great though, the staff both on the ground and in the  air were very helpful and did everything they could  to ensure I  am doing ok. The crew came  over often with  me and the food was ok , was first  given a cot  for my baby.  He originally wanted a one of  these Britax seats  we have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot, nope!  he was too  tired and could not lie straight so I asked for it to  be switched out  and he was asleep with 15  minutes All the  people in economy  went out of  service at least  2 hours before  I reached our destination so everyone  opted to used the business class , I'm sure that was annoying  to the people seated there and  complaints were constant."
1.0,"London to Nairobi via London. The  one good thing was the new  and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from Boston to Heathrow. The cabin crew  service was below standard. I had  a window seat and twice I  felt passed up  or not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was, simply because I was  at a movie. I  noticed that if you  did have eye  level with the  crew you were not offered anything. Airplane food is not exactly gourmet but BA food was so bland even the little I ate was only because I  felt hungry. The connecting flight from  Boston to Nairobi  was  worse because the plane  missed the   majority of the  way from Boston to Heathrow. It  was beat up and lacked even  basic basics like a USB port.  The crew service on this leg  is  below  standard I'm probably to blame because  of overrated BA  while flying with them but now I know better. "
4.0,"London to San  Diego via Heathrow.  Not convinced the  airline has dropped  significantly in the  past several years.  We booked World  Economy Plus or  Business Economy which  cost appr. twice  as much as  BA The flight  to SFO was  fine seat wise  as the plane  being an A380  so I has  half an aisle . The food  is disgusting for  and during the  flight we were  handed a box  of several pieces  for junk food  and shortly before  that given a  slice of pizza.  The choice of  pizza leaves a lot to be  desired There were  no drinks offered , and you  must go to  the bulkhead to  buy extra if  necessary We were  given maybe two  warm drinks during  our 12 hours  of the plane  left due to  the delay leaving  the UK). The  trip back to  the UK was  better since it  was a Boeing  737 with the  far bulkier seats.  You couldn't even  adjust to the  climate control hidden  in the inside  under the seat  because I'm not . The recliner  cannot work properly , the general  feeling around the  plane is cramped  and the person  closest to me  moves over to  their seat. I  feel sorry for  other people. The  meal was just  too bland and  bland and barely  offered warm drinks.  Airport staff seem  annoyed with certain  things Next time  heading off to  the US I  will look for  a alternative airline."
1.0,Welcome to Lyon.  The flight has  a 30 delay  after a flight  time of 1:30.  The staff forced me to check-in  the suitcase during  boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase  returned with 2  big cuts on  my back. Then the customer service  have been very  poor Such a  pretty bad experience.  I do not  recommend flying with  anyone
8.0,London to Boston.  Finally was seated  close to a customer who was  also an extra . The flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured I  stayed comfortable throughout  the flight. Superb  Customer Service.
5.0,Flight to London. Standard configuration on  Long haul European . Business class  with 3 seats  along side of  an isle. Middle seat fitted with a tray. Had  the wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in  attendance Drinks served  to a smile and the food . Food reminding  you what was  like in economy  10 years ago when there still  food free there.  But best part  about the meal  is the cheese and pudding.
1.0,"London to London  - 33 minutes late - three  people taking off,  landing and getting  on walkway to the airplane. This  had happened twice  last year. I  use KLM 90%  all the time  on this route  so am delayed  only rarely. I  take British on this route  when it is  much cheaper but  rarely delayed. I’m  told it’s bad luck but if  we do better  and double the  flight time you  risk having a  better day. "
1.0,"Los Aires to London. We flew overnight Friday 9th . The plane  seating is worn out and uncomfortable, there were large numbers or Argentinian passengers on the plane yet I saw no staff that spoke Spanish. The chicken dinner  was described as  good but there was no sauce  on it. The  dinner roll was stale and dessert stodgy, During the night no water was offered to me. It was not possible to  access electronic equipment,  the seatback screens were small with a limited choice of entertainment."
1.0,"Business Class space is ridiculously narrow.  Security is very  dark You are  also allowed laptops on the flight  into Riyadh, so  I cannot work if you want ! You cannot choose when to  fly"
1.0,Back to Heathrow to connect to  the flight in  Glasgow the day after. During check-in  on the BA  confirmed there was a problem that  they had to  fix after that  when I opened  it that the  boarding pass was  now not allowing  me to add a bag in the hold. After  contacting BA and  explaining the situation was told that  one option was  the pay £65 at the airport . What a rip off for  the short flight.  Of curiosity I checked with Easyjet and if I 'd booked with them for the  same day would  it cost me  the same to fly as the money BA asked  about the bag.
1.0,"You would not  use this airline.  I travel a  LOT for work  I get to fly different airlines  so have a  home base to compare it to. Baggage Allowance: Only  allows you 23kgs of checked baggage  but if you  take 1 kg s (regardless if  any other bags  of your other travel companions are ), you have to pay $170AUD extra. This is  my strictest airline I have ever used. All other  airlines have allowed  3 to 5kgs over at no charge. Ensure you have pre-weighed all bags. In-flight meal:  All the way to Sydney, they served soggy squashed  food as a  meal It is an 8 hour  flight Make sure  your pack your  favourite snacks/meal. You  never get a  glass of water and they rarely  have drinks. Make  certain you pre-pack  a bottle or  bottle once you are through customs. Customer service: From  The get go , customer service was appalling. It is hard enough  traveling with kids,  however having to  travel with BA  more stressful. They wouldn't allow me  the swap my  seat with my husband as we 're traveling with my kids and  they had a  huge delay which  meant I couldn't go on the  next flight. At  the airport, they  cannot find my children's booking which  created further delay  & stress. How do you misplace  3 kids on the same booking? They then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldn't  offer anything to help change this. We had to ask the person  talking to my kids once on the plane on  his own. Don't  try flying BA."
3.0,"New York to  Budapest via London.  This second flight  is a bit different. The plane  is clean, but cold. I wanted to drink water,  however the cabin crew does not accepted my request.  By mistake the captain welcomed the passengers to Bucharest and not Budapest."
7.0,"Heathrow to Athens  Airbus A321. Arrived at the airport in time and bag drop was  at ease. Got to the gate within 30mins of bag drop with light security queues.  In the aircraft, there was sufficient seat legroom for  my seat 7F.  A funny safety video played and the flight was smooth. No food was served, except some M&S,  and news was  displayed on the screens, with no sound and Russian captions, quite confusing. The plane landed  within an hour  later but it 's the best landing I have ever experienced."
4.0,"On to Bangkok. I am not  big fan if  any BA configuration  is Business. However  we did have  seat 2J so it was right  up front. I 'm not sure  how to begin.  Food awful, I  wanted beef (a showcase of British  in the notes ), that was  why I left  most of it. Instead of asking  was something wrong  or would I  like another meal ? the FA  put the tray away and asked  what I wanted . Wine 2 . 2 whites  and 2 champagnes  - hardly a  long wine list.  The small screen  and dreadful resolution , a very  good ordinary range  wine options. Staff  friendly at best,  although some had not been in  business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The  food was over kill for me. The toilet was  always checked very  frequently a sweet wrapper remained on  the toilet floor  the entire trip  so did an  entire rubbish bin.  You would expect much better up  on front of  a plane we  paid a premium  to be there  and the service  and overall product  does not match  that "
3.0,"Abu Dhabi to  Paris Although a BA flight, this sector was operated  from Air Belgium and offered a really poor experience. Aircraft felt old and tired, cabin  lights were totally  off cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedible.  Overall really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the  immediate future."
1.0,"Flight to Orlando.  Based on the  seat cotton buds  on the seat ? Disgusting and  had to force  me to clean.  No entertainment on  board it was  barely functional. Internet  is at three  time Emirates price , twice AA X and speed  I won’t achieve . When I  complained to BA they told me I couldn’t communicate  through the CEO  until I could  communicate with their  customer relations. I 've been Gold  Star BA for  5 years and  its time to  avoid this 
non  flying airline."
9.0,"London to Las Vegas via London. Both my flights  was great, on time and the food was good on the flight to London, and a nice bottle of champagne as well. My long haul flight was  very good, aircraft was 20yrs old  but clean, cabin  crew were very  very friendly and efficient, my pre flight meal was absolutely fantastic, the only complaint I can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved, ie, try showing some classic British comedy programmes instead of  some unfunny modern  fare and also include some good  classic rock music that people have actually heard of,  aside from that, absolutely great, well recommended."
9.0,"While it is still fresh in my mind, I’d like to commend the hard working  management of my BA flight from St.Petersburg to London Heathrow on 23rd  January 2018. The check-in staff were  very professional and helpful and assisted me with a . Boarding was  conducted remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner. The cabin crew were welcoming and very professional  about their appearance  and demeanor too. The cabin was  extremely clean and the flight departed on time and  arrived slightly early. The captain was informative. My only  regret was the lack of a  seat map on  this flight and the M&S buy  on board option was a bit  disappointing Disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in  a courteous and sincere way. This flight has restored my faith in BA. Well done to the superb crew!"
3.0,"London to Philadelphia. I upgraded from  private to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience  flying business class  in the Boeing  747 but I  left disappointed. While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have  care less about  the business guests. 2-3-2 in business  had some seats  in the cockpit and others the  front BA lost me as a traveler because the  crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a  cocktail I asked for rose champagne  but I was told “I guess I have to  go find a  second and open one”. In my previous business class  flights there are beverages served every 2 hours, not  for this almost  3 hour flight. I was served  a main meal almost 2.5 hours  from takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one  minute and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the  next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they  offer the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have  also say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes,  the decent business amenities however they  lost me in the service. I  did not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them  until I have another option. They need to improve when it comes  the inflight experiences , treatment specially for their business class travelers."
8.0,Madrid to London.  Big improvement. This  night club Europe flight was on  the B777 so  we were flat . BA have  revamped their menus  so instead of  offering a sandwich  they offered a  whole meal service.  Great choices of  food and food was good quality. Good BA listened  to feedback. They  are as always  let down by  our Iberia partners  in that their  BA business lounge  looked abysmal as  well With no toilets available and  one lone tortilla  for the unique  food offering along  side dirty tables
4.0,"On to Munich. The ground staff  seemed very friendly  and the plane  very clean. Once  registration was completed  we were informed  however due to  difficulties with the  aircraft the flight  would be delayed  by 40 minutes.  I hadn't finished  loading the baggage  so this was  evident from the  view out of  my window, where  I could see  baggage still arriving  or being loaded after our scheduled . Aircrew were  loaded but this  may have been the last flight  for the day  if you noticed . Flight was uneventful they had  the flight tracking  it down for  20 minutes before they retracted. Other  than being lied to as to  a reason for  the delay the  pilot offered the  assistance required."
2.0,"Return to Cape Town.  Waiting at gate, the  woman announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high. Air conditioning problem  cannot board. She said all doors  on aircraft have been opened, lights dimmed or switched off to decrease temperature, boarding will start as soon as possible. Finally one hour after take off temperature became acceptable. "
5.0,"The flight from  London to LHR with British Airways.  On the plus , the ground  level cabin crew  is very friendly,  there is the baggage allowance, plane , not new  but clean. You  had to pay  all your food and beverages on  a short haul ! The departure  is delayed by  15 minutes and  a further delay  our arrival for  another total of  20 minutes later than expected. We also parked at a gate at  very very far  side of T5.  One plus side  to all the  delays was that  my luggage was  still waiting for  Air Service as expected for the price and that  would be the  reason for choosing  it again. When  traveling with an infant the delays  start to compound ."
9.0,"Manchester to Philadelphia  from London. MAN-LHR I am not  British so the  central Europe seating is fine for me on a short flight. Addressed  by name - adequate breakfast of  egg roll, fruit and yoghurt. Concorde Room not crowded and no wait  on showers. LHR-PHL on aged 747 , still my favorite - cabin/washrooms in very good  shape though. I have no problem  with the BA  cabin layout unlike  in many posters  - Excellent flight  - experienced crew and though full cabin, all very smooth and professional. Beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank, good wines as  well - nice  also see a  few British bubbly included. Only downside  is deplaning in  Frankfurt where F passengers had to fight their way off through the J scrum -  should have been controlled by crew,  it was not."
1.0,London to London.  Hotel and interior  only with a  really small IFE screen. I did  NOT like the  service Had a  bad connection and  I was rebooked from another partner.  On arrival in  London others for  this same connecting  flights were awaited  but not me. I was told there would be  other agents in purple everywhere but I found none.  A fast track  process was non stop Total experience was bad.
2.0,"London to Toronto.  One day trip to play golf  for my Father,  but BA lost  their clubs for  two days. Dealing  with BA lost  their service was , they had  an idea where  the clubs were  nor how long  the would take to retrieve them.  I had packed  all my clothes with my clubs.  3 days of  flying were to buy clothes and  clubs Flight home  - LHR-YYZ was  an old 777  - a misplaced  seating cushion, and  my broken seat  belt wouldn't stay . The IFE  was badly needs  replacing and no  USB ports at the seats -  another 7.5hr flight.  as bad as I thought Air line was they  are light years  back of BA.  :-)"
2.0,"Welcome to Vienna.  She was shocked . BA provides  nothing onboard short  leg flights -  no free water,  coffee or tea.  She tried to  buy something but  her Credit Card  wont work, and  she could not  part with cash."
3.0,"Johannesburg to London.  People tend to stay with an airline as a  cheap flyer and  not fly business , I have seen a change for the worst  in BA service,  but it does not seem to  go any better.  I finally a  bed pillow, a very good one . The rest is a waste  for money unless  this new announced  First World seat is introduced where all this will  fit perfectly.   Being in a window seat makes  it  impossible  you make up  your bed properly with them new . I don't  eat top food in a plane , I expect ! If you announce things, make  what you have  champagne On some  airlines Champagne is  still being served when you have taken your seat. Premium economy however  has a sparkling  wine  You  can eat when  I order you  can eat. They  seem to have  an out of  stock items such  as a gin other than Gordon's.  I have to decide upon breakfast  when you even  have dinner. Entertainment,  be sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things  in view. BA  gives you the most limited offer."
8.0,"Back to London Heathrow. It's my first time traveling on British Airways.  The seat arrangement  for its long-haul business class is very uncommon that half of the  seats are facing : So you  sit face-to-face with the one sitting opposite you (at  most during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down). There are 8 Club World seats  a row for 777-300ER, which is  somewhat narrower if  competitive with other carriers serving this route. The cabin service was as  fast as expected.  All I saw  was chocolate bars and sweets for  my minibar during . There could be some other choices."
2.0,"London to Los ax Booked this  plane eight months  back and as  we lost my  seat on BA  a few years  before were forced  and pay an  outrageous £180 for  our two seats.  The flight I  booked was a  Boeing 787 and  I prepared to  fly with the  spare cash so  I could be  given the small front cabin. Never  having anything to  be according to  expectations with BA  as our flight  being cancelled a  couple days before.  We were rebooked  at a later  plane which they  upgraded from an  hour to a  standard one year  class Jumbo. We  were then seated  right at the  back of Club  and to benefit  as a screaming  baby sat in  our front row  of premium. We  was greeted by  the rather pleasant  gentleman who told  us he would  continue looking after  us for the  flight he then  left never to  be seen again.  Food was served  about an hour  before take off  for an eleven  minute flight. The  plane so tough  was it impossible  was cut and  could only be  cut by picking  up and biting  it off. After a few hours  i went   to the galley  and seek out  a drink as  the crew had  just stood there  having completely ignored  my three stewardesses.  Only one stopped  by and managed  the get me  another drink. The  last meal was  only about seven  days after lunch,  one sandwich, at  least that one  was edible. The  cabin was as  one would expect  from such an  old plane totally  not getting out  is a task  by itself. I  had WiFi for  the whole trip,  it ran for  around 50% of  the flight, yet  one customer (non ?) services refuse  the refund the  fee even though I sent them  the whole host  of screenshots showing  the various times  it was no  customer service, but  they are happy  to note the  following We have  had BA now  is some time,  one where there  is no other  option as on  mainland Europe. But  in transatlantic they  are probably the  best of the  world We only  did this trip  would use up  our Avios, they 've all been  replaced now and  we could come  directly from LAX  via Virgin Atlantic.  Yet again, BA  is world offered  as a farce  for today's business ."
4.0,"Miami to London . As with many others whom 've posted reviews on this site  the issue is with BA's customer  care when dealing  to an issue  that has arisen from flying on  a once proud  aircraft My issue  was with faulty  seats onboard. Issue  with my seat , the onboard  crews tried to  the best of their ability to  help but unable  to through no  lack of effort and have nothing but praise for  the guys working  on aging equipment  and keep on  going to do  their best to  assist the customer ! Had to  switch seat and as first, club bed premium economy  in full, had  a move back  to economy. Asked  the services to refund me the fare difference for  that part of  the journey and after several cut  & past generic replies on their  end and fed  me hitting my head off a brick wall have  gave up as life is too  short to fight  battles over customer  and organisation. Following a favourable review of my outward  flights it is  clear BA lacks consistency and don't  bother to deal with issue when something goes wrong. As i said in both my reviews nothing but  respect for the  flight crews dealing  to these issues and trying to make it a  great experiance but  that BA now  need to work on their problem solving skills. I  still have 91000 km going to  London as my business will be  no else where."
1.0,"London Heathrow to  Lisbon Malpensa. Worst airline I’ve ever dealt with. I  fly 100+ times a year. British  Airways lost my  or my wife’s luggage on our  vacation They have  been unbelievably rude  and unhelpful in resolving this issue.  You have ruined  my vacation and refuse to help . Please, never  use this airline."
1.0,"Calgary to Rome via London. My wife and I booked our 10th anniversary trip from Calgary to Rome return, with British Airways, Sept 17-27. This was my first trip in  Italy and we spent almost $8500 CAD on first  class tickets. The flight Calgary to London (stopover) was ok. I got  one bottle of water, and then nobody came to  the pod I was in for  the next 8  minutes One would have expected more  than first class,  just another bottle  of water? They asked me to  write out what I would like for breakfast on  the card. I filled it out  and no breakfast  nor even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia  flight broke down in Naples, and  you were 80  mins late. My  family tried dozens  more times to  contact British Airways but none of their phone numbers  found on the website were working; most of the  number were just  working and some were out of  service We tried the numbers from our tickets, their  website their help  desk Facebook page, Google etc. We  rang at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check  me in. There was a glitch  on the computer  where they needed my passport to  go in, once  the wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said  everything is complete.  There was a  technical glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we  were at the  Calgary airport 5 mins too late for me to  check in. My wife was ok  and could go through but I  was not. We asked the 3  ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently,  someone said it  would have been different if we  called before, and we showed them  my phone (see the attached photos)  with all the calls we made. They then told us it was  the ticket kiosk  problem and they  would reschedule us.  And gave us  the number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually  challenged and had  eye surgery just 2 weeks prior,  so I was not allowed to carry over 5 . She was  carrying all the luggage, the ticketing , and after 10 hours of  travelling she was very stressed. The attitude of these  employees certainly did  NOT help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number  you were given did work, and my wife was  answering the phone  when Customer Service  takes over an hour. After reviewing <mask> details with several teams of <mask> we were <mask> basically that they didn't believe us that we <mask> to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever <mask> given, nor the slightest help <mask> accommodation for us being stranded in Rome. We <mask> made it home on different <mask> but I have lost all <mask> and trust for British Airways. <mask> any corporation <mask> are only interested in taking <mask> money while <mask> minimal effort to customer support."
2.0,"Welcome to Bangkok.  Fly British Airways  is the first  flight in a  lot of years.  Flight 5 is . It may  sound great, but  we have to  go further using  the train services  to get there,  then once there  one may find  yourself after check  that you need  a travel   again on another  flight  to  the T5a or  onwards as they  are again separate  into sections of  flight 5. I usually fly EVA  or others from  tier 2 and  definitely would avoid  it if possible  for now on.  the aircraft interior  looked old and  newer the seats  had seen better  days and the  small screen was  about the size  of an iPhone  7 (without the ) The food  looked ok at  first served cold  and warm on  the meals on  most flights. The  toilets were okay  on the flight  home however on  a flight out  some were not  available when you  came to them.  The cards for  passengers were loaded  into the aircraft , a total  number about 50  so most people  in economy had  to land in  Thailand and spend  time filling one  in just before  boarding which is  fine as the  flight is always  busy at Bangkok  if you want  to just get  on with clearing  customs and getting  the bag. The  crew had some  problems on the  journey back to  my UK, and  although this isn’t  an airlines fault,  you did notice  this when one  poor guy of  age 21 was  given no more  service by the  cabin manager (he  walked off) the  only crew member  could serve him.  It is the  only time by  far I will  still fly British  Airways if there’s  no seats available  anywhere else (which  is why I  fly with them  this time), then  i guess I’ll  had no choice."
10.0,from Heathrow to  Southampton The airport  experience was very  pleasant the crew  was also very  friendly and the  curry was delicious.  We had the old personal entertainment system but it  worked very well.  Actually it was one of the  best flights I  had
9.0,"London to Singapore.  This was a  great flight.   I was lucky  with a 2-seats-row  of my own on the upperdeck,  but that was only the last  thing to make  this flight perfect.  My crew was  super friendly and  their food was  THE best I've  had on an  airline If you  fly the A380  for economy, book  it in the  cabin Best seats  for the plane:  76 or 83K."
1.0,"Coming to London.  i was trying to add additional  baggage online but system was keep  showing that my email address is  the correct, but  I was giving  me correct email . When I  checked in my  account then additional  luggage option was  completely gone and  they asked me to add additional  baggage from airport charging me €70  to compare to €35 online price.  After I phoned  customers care to  report the issue,  the care agent  has dropped my  phone three times. On fourth time I was talking  back of the customer care agent. He was not helpful at all,  whenever I asked  him to connect  up with his  supervisor or manager,  she put me  to hold for  around 55 mins  while said manager  was busy. This is completely unprofessional , was showing no empathy. British  Airways is trying  the rob me , compelling me  with pay double price at airport  with extra baggage. British Airways was  not my first  choice Unfortunately, I  cannot be flying  twice with British  Air due to  this awkward behavior."
6.0,"5 - Pisa (Return). I fly  this route often  and we have  the house in  Naples This, in  its reasonableness was the best so far - but  maybe just. Outbound  I went through the ""First"" wing check in at  BA (We are  credit card members).  The breakfast we  ate in the  lounge was just about OK. The  flight lounge was  great We took  off on time . I declined  a cooked breakfast. The lady next to me had a full English  and it did  sound rather nice.  Our Captain popped  up for the  chat and I  held his eye  we enjoyed a  good ten minutes  and so chat  on aviation. A  really nice bloke,  we landed the  flight superbly. Coming  in we were delayed by 45  minutes due to  Hurricane Ali. We  had a very  nice lunch with  a new Club  Fare menu which  comes into effect  three days earlier.  Very nice prawn cocktail and a  really nice coronation ! Downed a  packet of G&Ts.  Staff on both  sides were great. There has been  some massive improvement  even on the  seating side. The  service is still . Three seats  in two and zero legroom. BA  passengers should look  into the competition  on the Far  North who offer  more regionalized business ! The product  is only worth  investing in a  few or Avious points. The every  hour fare price  is ludicrous."
1.0,"I was in Prague flying British Airways back to Heathrow. Apparently there were thunderstorms in London so the  planes were being delayed. My 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. There was no British Airways person at the Prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out  bits of paper advising people of the remuneration available  at them should  they spend the  night and wait  until the 8 am flight. The  piece of information didn't offer any hotel suggestions or  instructions of how  I get back into Prague. This  flyer also mentioned that there was  a 20:00 flight and there was  room for thirty people on this flight. So after  contacting British Airways  and finding  their offices were  still closed for  an evening, I  went  online and booked the  flight Because of the late timing, I was charged . Then after  many emails and  days spent trying  to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight  voucher I had  purchased 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 USD. They also  promised they would  give me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until  i receive it. Is there any other airline that doesn't simply rebook  their significantly delayed  passenger on the  next flight and  not try to  get outrageous sums from them? I 'll never fly British Airways again."
7.0,"• KUL-LHR 6 Sept, return BA11 c on 16  October All flights  were World Traveller  class with the  exception of SIN-KUL  or MH economy.  Unlike the KUL-LHR , the aircraft  was clean and  comfortable in the  main cabin. The  beds were the biggest let down.  While there was  enough legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when  used with virtually  full lumbar support.  My headrest did  NOT move at all. The seats  sit at the  front which is  odd and given that they are  very wide, there  is very little storage apart from the usual pocket  space I think  is a missed  call by BA to maximise utilisation  this space. The food was okay,  you get two  and the first  being quite substantial  but the second  being a joke.  It was okay  but the best  part of the  flight was the staff who were pleasant and obliging.  Our return flight  arrived on an . Excellent boarding procedure as it  was a full  cabin Again, seats  were the same  on the A380  except that wonderful  extra space on  an upper cabin.  They were less  uncomfortable this time ! Overall, I  will recommend them  but attention needs to be paid  in their seats."
6.0,We flew from  Las Angeles to Leeds Bradford via  JFK on Thursday  14 September with  UK Airways and codeshare partner American Airways. We arrived safely but our  luggage did not.  This is now  Sunday afternoon and after receiving five different text messages  in each previous  flight we are still without our bags. Come on  and sort this shambles out.
3.0,"Brindisi to London.  This from any  nation that includes  us among its  main airlines has  must be a  good sign. Brindisi  Airport is at least modern but it makes few  concessions to comfort  as there was  absolutely no lounge  accommodating Club Europe passengers. There was  absolutely no priority  list or, indeed,  of anything. Boarding  is a fiasco,  with two lines directed into pens,  and the mad  rush to the plane, which then  - using a  very weird, tiered  series of steps , was just another queue. Service  for Club Europe  flowed efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the  more cheery type  we have been  better suited to : The brief  customer service over,  we was on to the the  all new look Club Europe meal . Sadly, this  seemed to be  just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything  crammed on to  the tiny plastic  tray at once,  from the appetiser  and cheese 'courses'  relegated to microscopic  plates in little pots. And, of  course the seats  have changed, although,  the BA seem  keen on packing  ever more passengers  to the Club  Europe section, which  means that the  airline is little  compared to the old economy. Still,  we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did  result in our  luggage coming off the belt within  only a few ! It's just that the whole  airline experience is  rather lacklustre and un-business-like."
1.0,"London to London.  i have flown long haul many  flights with both  BA and Virgin  premium economy. In  my view whilst  a Virgin product  has improved, the BA equivalent has deteriorated such that Virgin is significantly  worse Despite booking  and paying for seats with BA  I got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of WT+ on  the A380 which  was dreadful seats  and the toilet with limited recline  for an overnight  flight For the first time in  3 years I  find the food  bad and the service not great (for example no  water initially on  flight no food choice as had  flown out of  no choice, one  food serving and  not where to get water on flight). Went through 3 layers of  customer service with BA on seat booking issue but  was fobbed off. Plane was also very warm so that in all  honesty very uncomfortable  one leg. "
2.0,"Berlin to London.  This was a connecting flight, so  we should not complain. The flight was on time and the machine  worked and? They do not serve free water, let alone tea or coffee. While this obviously costs nothing  it testifies to the low perception of customers. BA simply turned into a low cost airline."
10.0,"British Airways is  a favorite airline. Boeing 777 was 21 years old but clean. The  service was professional. Food was above expectation. During 7 hours flight staff  is always there.  They kept updating us about weather,  flight and time. "
7.0,"Rome to Newark via London. The first sector was  on a A319. Flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time. Boarding at FCO was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2. Flight attendants friendly and welcoming. Seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. No entertainment either. Was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than  whatever appeared to be on the M&S menu. Connection at T5 was smooth as anything  on our arrival mid afternoon. Boarding for the flight  into Newark was organised and painless. I was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped. Happy to say, the seat comfort was  very good, legroom was manageable. I  am however surprised  as for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirty. There was grime around the USB port (which didn't work), tv screen and along the floor by the wall. The cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well. I found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in response. The selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen before. The real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their service. They were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick. The main meal was decent  but the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing. All in all, a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector."
6.0,"From Heathrow to New York JFK.  Our First Wing  of Terminal 5  were rubbish tonight, 20 or so  people and it’s really the only  working part of BA’s ground operation.  It left late due to repairs then the usual  wait for a  lay in at  night made us  leave late. Staff  was cheerful. This route gets decent  food normally but  with 3 main  meals and the  roast chicken was  pretty bland."
9.0,"London Heathrow to  Southampton This was the first time I had flown in first class  and on BA. I had read  several reviews before travelling and they  are somewhat mixed. BA's first class cabin is not even close to  the best in the skies but  once again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little  bit flexible on dates. We were  in a 777  and is probably one of the oldest in the BA fleet. The cabin was clean but a little bit tired in  spots but the  interior was very comfortable and spacious. The sleep suit and amenity kit  was great with lots of little  pockets to make  things more comfy. It is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife  was delighted with the contents. The  wine that BA offer in first  is superb. I  enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best  that I have tasted. Choice of other wines is  great too and a particular treat  was the Johnnie Walker Blue Label  unless you are a whiskey drinker. Food was very tasty and well  done I had  the seared prawn amuse bouche followed  with poached baby pear with blue berry and walnut brittle then Lamb Machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille. We were  given ice creams  a hour or two later and then afternoon tea  the couple of hours before landing. I cant really fault any of it. It was  THE best airline food i have ever eaten and  nicer than a number of restaurant  menus too. IFE  very decent although  my screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. I believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787.  i do wish they had a  full series of  this show rather  that just some  random episodes but  there was plenty  for choice. The thing that really  turned this flight  special were the cabin crew. From  that moment we  came on board  when we deplaned  they were fabulous. Attentive with out being over-bearing. Witty  yet charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need. They were superb. Wifi was available but  my page to  watch didn't load up when i tried it. I  didnt really pursue  it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer. This was a great  experience and i  would wholly recommend that you try  BA first. Whether  I would choose it over Club  Emirates would be  the flight by  route basis. You  have to do it once though!"
1.0,Heraklion to Gatwick. Left my luggage  hanging on the belt by mistake.  10 mins after I realised I  went back to  an airport but  the British Airways staff was willing to help. Asked me to ring  their phone from the arrival hall pillar. Dialed for  the baggage enquiry and staff picked  off the phone and hung up  with purpose and never answered again. This is so frustrating.
8.0,"From Madrid to  London Heathrow. The  plane is ancient , BA have  never given up  on hiding that  so I guess  BA will be  taking these old  but great planes  out of service ? I love  travelling in 767s,  their configurations are  all very comfortable  and to be  fair the plane  looks really dated  and BA should  definitely improve this.  Apart from this  last flight was  generally very good  and BA Business  class has in  our experience always  delivered consistent, consistently  good BA cabin  suites in Business  class are a real asset. This  was one of  their more traditional  flights and they  created a very  nice atmosphere. The  flight was very  pleasant but the  people were very  noisy and the  atmosphere on the  aircraft did not  help the overall  atmosphere Food was  quite tasty indeed , there was  another excellent selection  of drinks. I'll  am sad to  watch the 767s  again but the  time has come."
4.0,"London Heathrow to Brindisi. We weren’t  in the long  queue for Club Europe check-in, but mid-afternoon is apparently particularly busy in T5. Galleries South gate was also teeming, but at  once the filthy  toilets had been  cleaned and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food.  Check boarding was handled efficiently. The A321 was relatively  fast and clean, no pre-take-off drinks were offered. Departure was delayed by about 30 minutes but arrival was on time. The  club Europe section was unusually busy, with at least  five fully occupied rows, including families with pre-school children. Despite the congestion and chaos, the food and drink  section was handled efficiently, although the food was no better than the old World Traveller offering. It’s hard to see the point of BA’s short haul business class product when  customer experience is second rate."
3.0,"I have BA silver membership. This promises fast track,  choice of seats at booking, priority boarding and lounge  benefits I would  warn all travellers that in reality  the benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at  times The majority of the time my seat choice  is changed, fast track at Heathrow is slower than  my normal queue, and the lounges  are overcrowded that it's sometimes hard to find a seat. The Iberia lounge at Madrid  airport equality poor, with stale tortilla the only offering  at breakfast. British  Airlines is a rip off. I 've uploaded by way of example a seat map of their A321 and seat 22c. This seat is  with extra legroom  which is cramped like the others. Yet on BA.com they will try to sell it as an exit  seat as if it has extra legroom. I recently  travelled on Virgin  America and Cathay  Pacific in business  & economy and it really struck  home just how  cheap BA/Iberia are by comparison."
2.0,"Hamburg to London. Initial flight from  Hamburg cancelled from under us 3  hours from departure and we had a firm booking to collect a motorhome upon arrival.  Total chaos. Ground service appalling and no free service  to board. Checkin from Hamburg appallingly slow, and didn't  start until 2 hrs from departure.  Checking in demanded that cabin baggage be checked in  when we demanded we keep it.  all in all an unsatisfactory airline."
7.0,"Glasgow to Miami  from London. Glasgow to Heathrow was painless as was transfer to t3.  Edinburgh to Miami  in aging 747.  Was delayed by  1 hour due to temperatures on board being unsafe  on board. Kept  updated by gate team about progress.  Large TV screen tiny and poor  source of entertainment.  Cabin was looking  its age and  a bit run  down around the edges. Premium economy  seats in cabin , seat comfort  was superior on  deck What made  this journey very good was the  nice lady looking after the premium economy cabin. Polite,  very welcoming and  never was any bother for her.  Travel with a  crew from start  to finish .  People in here quick to criticise poor service so  a shout out to this crew member for doing  such great job.  All meals and drink selection very good. Although leaving  an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done  overall and looking  ahead to return journey."
8.0,"London Heathrow to  Frankfurt After so  much disappointing experience  with BA, this  is finally a  good flight. I  have an emergency  seat assigned at  an online check-in, though these are usually for extra money. On top  off this no  passenger sat next to me, so I had better  seat than the people in Euro class (Business class)  as their legroom  and the same  as on economy ). The flight departed and landed  within time and  was uneventful anyway."
7.0,"Flight to London . The flight  landed in time , would have  been ahead of  us if the  runway had not  gotten occupied by  some previous aircraft.  The ride was  tiny bit bumpy,  it was not  too serious. The flight was full  ( kids) and  their crew did  nothing to make  our journey smooth.  We did not purchase any food,  but I saw they ran out  of a lot  of options due  the the unexpected  number of on-board  food"
10.0,"Welcome to Toronto.  Minimum of 10  and age from  6 to over , Business Class  Cabin in 787/9  is conducive for  children travelling, allows  for interaction. Forward ed Class cabin  on 787 is  very private. Service  for both flights  is flawless, very  accommodating to the  two small children  while also allowing  all adults to  enjoy the meals.  Seat presentation especially  in the intercontinental  flights was really  great and the  service on both flights was simply  great Outstanding crew  of BA 603  and BA 99 01 on our  connecting flights from  Vancouver on August  8 similar great  flights BA gets  many negative reviews , myself travelling  frequently with them  have never had  any bad experience.  The seating arrangement  in Club World , perfect when  travelling with family.  Other carriers may  have an advantage  as one travels alone."
1.0,"Back to Heathrow.  To fly with BA on a  daily basis and  as a gold  medal holder, their  overall attitude and facilities drop lower and lower. The planes are filthy,  rarely cleaned properly  on flights, the staff are hit and miss -  sometimes more miss than anything and very poorly turned  out The food  service business is  appalling and the seating in the  smaller planes is terribly uncomfortable -  and as for customer service, there is no point  in ringing them  they are useless, rude, hostile and will never provide  ANY assistance whatsoever."
1.0,"Singapore to London. They wanted to charge me an extra GBP65 for  being over the  age limit. The legroom seemed very small to me,  The flight was super full and I was sitting next to a big woman who  was over her  half of the seat. I was asked if I would like tea or coffee with my breakfast and  the steward said  he will come back with the tea. After a long time I managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for  a tea and he just said , there was no tea. "
4.0,"Washington to Frankfurt via London. Check-In at Dulles Airport was smooth. I asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did, even though at the online check-in there was none ! Boeing 747-400 was 27 years old, the IFE was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad. The seats were ok, pretty standard  but they had a head rest which was good. My seat was 27A and I had the whole row for myself. Unfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his IFE and they would replace him on 27C. Shortly after take-off the service began. There were 2 food options available. Chicken and vegatarian lasagne, I went for the Lasagne which was ok, nothing special. It came with a salad, a bread bun and a black forest cake. All in all an ok meal, nothing to complain about. The crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying. After dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. I tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature IFE. In the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small  juice bottle. Connecting in Heathrow is pretty easy (in T5) there are signs everywhere! Security went fast. There is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and  even WIFI. We boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds. BA started to do a buy-on-board service which I hate. However I thought the pricing was ok. "
5.0,"Return to London.  The flight was  delayed from Rome  in an hour  but we could  only connect to  a next flight  from Los Angeles as we landed  in Heathrow 20  minutes before the  time There were  some staff members  who helped us , they have  to put us  on the next  plane tomorrow. They  put us on  the hotel next  to airport and  had dinner but  did not provide  any vouchers for  hotels and other  items "
7.0,We always like travelling on a  Airbus A380. Seats  like economy class  are comfortable and  are able to  talk which is  not on other  airlines or types a planes. However the food is  very poor. In  the last 12  years I have  seen some of  my worst airline  food served from  Delta or Cathay  Atlantic and this  is my most  recent travels with  British Airways. Thankfully BA airline staff  are always the best.
10.0,London Heathrow to  Southampton Really good  time on both legs of the journey. Got to board first and let crew know about the fact I was flying  home with slight  problems and they kept me safe  the entire flight  so was a bonus. Loved the  idea that they asked if I  felt OK on board too.
3.0,"London to Athens. Since I started using BA in 2011, I can 't say that the quality becomes worse. The leg room in Business Class in A320 is the same like in economy. The only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. The meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pie. Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). Also,  due to the plane being late, the cabin was  not cleaned properly. At some point we need to think why would someone choose BA  for low cost airlines. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault,  although at the end of the day I experience delays). What is that makes BA  avoid European flights ? Probably nothing."
10.0,"From Heathrow to  BA Had a great experience in  The Concorde Room,  the Galleries First , in Heathrow T5. I was  immediately greeted by a member of  BA crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and  had a look , all because I expressed a slight interest, and  for that I am thankful. The flight crew were very friendly and it was nice  and see what  went on in the cockpit. The  luggage was very  nicely presented, there  was a small  sleeping kit, as well as a pair of pyjamas.  The seat was  provided with pillows,  as well as ample storage space. You get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so I never ran  out of room.  My pre-departure beverage was a choice  of water, orange  juice or champagne  and hot towels  were handed out. The flight left slightly behind schedule, but at Heathrow, this is something  you expect. Very soon after take-off, the crew began  preparing dinner. I  have already booked  my meal in advance, but the  choice of starters, mains and deserts, as well as  a beverage menu, was very good.  The meal I  had was exceptionally tasty and I would have it again! Once dinner service had finished, the crew turned  over the bed  for me, whilst  others went and  changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided. The  mattress was very comfortable and at  slightly over 6 ft tall, I  would not have  many issues fitting into the bed and stretching out.  The were plenty  of blankets and pillows available and  everyone slept very  comfortably When I  awoke I was  offered coffee and a short while  before breakfast. The breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. I opted for the cooked option and I was not disappointed, as  food was very  tasty and there was a lot of it. The inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large  collection of films,  television programmes/series, audio books, and kids  programmes to choose from. The system was responsive and  very good quality, although I did not watch any , so I  cant speak of  its sound quality.  My crew served  everyone a smile and even when  you asked for a Latte, which the machine didn’t , the crew  stepped out of  their way to make one for me which was  extremely nice. They  definitely made this already special experience  even more special. If you want  and treat yourself to BA First,  I would thoroughly recommend it."
3.0,"London to London. Nice plane, nice  but low quality service on the plane. Both my husband and I ordered low sodium meals. His was delivered, mine was not. When asked, the attendant brought  an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray LSML. Obviously heated  fairly quickly but  was lukewarm, dry . I was troubled by the fact it was  served with no foil covering the  top Not the  problem as my  last meal, so  we have to take the airlines  for LSML that it was low sodium. Attendants serving coffee missed us , when I  pushed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up. One pass through the cabin for drinks. After that,  we had to go to the  back of the plane to find an attendant and  order a drink. Sandwich served before  boarding in the evening was horrendous. Hummus, limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced  bread made this stale sandwich unappealing  – tasteless to  say the least.  Had expected edible food and better, more friendly service with this airline.  My flight attendant , stone faced  but seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal. Before landing many people still had trash but  a final walk  was by our invisible flight crew.  We thought British Airways was better than this. "
1.0,"London to Las Vegas I experienced an ancient entertainment unit that was inoperable and could not be reset. The tray table did not stow properly so the  seat remained at  a 45 degree angle with the metal frame exposed. The seat cushion was so badly  padded it was  as if totally unpadded. One air vent for the 3-seat row and no in-seat power. Luggage was mislaid for 33 hours, even with priority tag. After writing to British Airways regarding disappointing flight, BA customer service contacted me and offered an apology and a $63USD voucher toward future BA travel to  made up for their shoddy service.  When you have a choice, choose another airline!"
5.0,"Flight to London , during the  trip (24 hours before, I checked in via app)  i was offered no choice of seating. During the flight, I was  asked by stewardess if I would  want any food , I find that approach not pleasant at all. I was not personally invited to use the Lounge. I find that  unacceptable for a business class fare. "
1.0,"I booked a round trip from  Milan to California for my honeymoon. First flight Milan to San Francisco via London, while returning flight was from Los Angeles to Milan always via London. Both  trips faced 1  minute delay and  in both flights our luggage were not delivered at destination. When you check in the  First business class is mixed with other One World  class so it 's not exclusive  after all. Only First has some real advantages. We found business lane crowded for the  flight  Worst business class experience  and totally disappointed."
8.0,"Toronto to LHR and LGW to Toronto return in WT+. Finally, BA  have moved back into it’s own lounge which has  been refurbished with new furniture. However, Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge. Food was ok – but the drinks  offered remain poor. Slick boarding and a full PE cabin on a 777. Water and  coffee offered on boarding but still  limited prosecco offered  for flights TO London. (apparently 3  flights loaded in  Toronto for the O/W leg but  none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. Fast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken  stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. The salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. Pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. Got a couple of hours sleep. However the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining  powered on and  not the IFE  still working. A reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of Delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. The standard T&Cs and  drinks and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. I continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat  this given how  expensive it is. (BA should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) After  arriving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early  to the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. For the return  flight I took the seasonal LGW  from Toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. An upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surprise. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track . Gatwick Airport sell £5 premium experience and so  our lane was full of folk paying 5 quid  checked in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick  airport crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a  thumbs up) before  take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul  crew from Heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet  crews at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar  service once airborne, followed by the  lounge Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a <mask> option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea <mask> was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that <mask> hybrid in nature and in <mask> to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but <mask> old menu. <mask> hope Gatwick catches up so <mask> don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being <mask> poor relative. <mask> the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a <mask> The food <mask> truly awful <mask> both dinner <mask> breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium <mask> I do <mask> regard the <mask> as a <mask> economy service <mask> than the seat. All that said, I felt that BA is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board <mask> (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. Long may <mask> improvement last!"
7.0,"San Francisco to London Heathrow on the lower deck  of the A380 - a very quiet smooth flight. Did not want  t pay the usual BA extortionate  extra pre-reservation fees  so still got seats together. After the real scrum at the departure gate - no  seating order, struggle  ot get through to Priority Lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded  with the reasonably , if narrow, seats. Of course  the usual BA Club Class ""scramble over the legs"" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive Business Class World. Welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive FA. OK meal - beef - with decent wines  too accompany. Much  worked up to  new touch screen AVOD system but still a dreadful choice of ""blockbuster"" films. Very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it. Really very good FA's - made you feel welcome. Landed on time but  sadly for some  passengers took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt. As usual I have mixed  opinions about BA , if we 're lucky enough to fly Club/Business Class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge  fees to pre-reserve seat. If Virgin Atlantic fly the  same route I will always choose their Upper Class as everyone has aisle access and you don't have to pay to pre-reserve your seat."
10.0,"London to Dublin.  It was an  excellent morning departure  at Heathrow on  one full flight.  Airbus managed everything in a very  professional manner. The  process was efficient  as the boarding process was conducted  up to the . The cabin  attendants were immaculate  with appearance and  showed the safety  procedures along with  a video. During  a short and  quite busy flight , crew were  quick to sell  coffee and snacks and left a  great impression. I  experienced a not  too good experience  with this airline  back in the  past and am  glad to see  again this time  things were superb."
7.0,"London to Paris. I wish that  Airbus would update  their aircraft or  maybe even do a little refurbishing.  Especially when the seats feel worn out and the  price for what  you are paying  just does not  feel worth it.  that being said,  it is better  on any low-cost  airline"
7.0,"Delivering outstanding customer service onboard. British Airways may not  have the cleanest, newest or comfortable  planes but their customer service has  consistently been a delight  since  you have flown  on them."
7.0,"This was a night flight New York JFK to London, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what I experienced was certainly not bad. I think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in First. But it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the  comparison of the Concorde Room and First cabin. The former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of  overly fussy. It's irritating that they don't have any showers in the Concorde Room; I wasn't amused to  get in at the Galleries (business) Lounge, be brusquely  booked on to Concorde, only to have to return  to Galeries upon  learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early August in  NYC - of course I needed a shower!). Departures  from NY were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. But we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased  through multiple - and very welcome  - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. Likewise, all the perks of first class were there; I was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken,  everything All very courteous and professional. After such a long delay, I decided to have some more dinner as I was  quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. But the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. Moreover, it would have  be nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had I  heard this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. A very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in T5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). The cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online.  And it's certainly nothing special for First Class. Overall, a very acceptable flight, but I  think that the overly-fussy service sometimes  gets in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight Atlantic crossing (where can I have a shower in the morning? Where will I be having breakfast?). I've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects. "
1.0,"Welcome to London.  Great service both on the flight  & subsequent customer service. We are  not vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. Meals were delivered as usual, and  have the vegan slip on them, but as I  got about to start eating I  noticed that I 'd been given  meat - this made me doubt the authenticity of  the meal. When  we called the  lady over she had no idea what a vegan  is informing me that there was  some meat in  it I had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). It turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in ! Needless to say we did  NOT eat our meals and they had no vegan ! Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked  about a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I  then had to  clarify what a  vegetarian was said ""oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed ."" I had  then re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned  she said 'We  cannot provide that  type of thing."" That was strange, because 2 weeks  ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals,  no hot drinks, and our video screen did not . The Customer  service that followed from was more appalling, they could  not care less,  it took ages  to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off. After several months  without having to  get emails I was informed that  we had to submit everything by  phone as they  had it on  - which was  yet another way of getting rid  off us. So  I did this,  and several more  months they offered us the most  reasonable compensation -  minus the value of the meals that we could not eat -  as vouchers. "
5.0,"Paphos to London Gatwick in Club Europe. We had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed, as were many other flights, due to bad weather the previous evening in UK. We  checked in on time, only to  being advised that there was no lounge available for Club Europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay! Whilst we appreciate that there may not be a BA lounge it is normal that BA would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we  have experience at many other airports when travelling in  first class. We were offered a €10 voucher each, due to the delayed flight!! Paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money  to travel in business class we were very disappointed with BA, that no lounge access was available. The flight itself was OK, although two hours late. The  flight crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli  au carne and I chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. On arrival at Gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control , and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor show. BA has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight Like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service'  experience and in this case BA were lacking."
8.0,"Welcome to Paphos in Club Europe. We travelled on the first Saturday  after the school  term and whilst  BA was busy  the check in , business class  opted not to . We expected the lounge to be busy but  there was plenty of free seats.  We flight boarded  quite late but we were not  late in the take off queue. We are used the BA's Club Europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the  service was reasonably  good Service from the cabin crew was good. It is nice that BA have gone away from the miniature bottles of  water in Club Europe and now  go by the glass. The meal service was quite good, we both chose the chicken curry for the  main course, which  were tasty and  not dried out.  Dinner arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Very happy  with the service."
4.0,"New York to  London via London. Flight Attendants were wonderful, friendly, cheery and helpful. But the business Class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have  to crawl over  four legs of a sleeping stranger,  especially if you are seated next  with a companion. There is no  wheelchair accessible storage  area by the  door even for a bottle of  wine The IFE  in the LHR-NBO A reminds me  that the game  lacks in its resolution and food is mediocre, at best. BA charges  4 select Business  Class seats. For my family of  four it would  probably cost over $1,600 to get 4 assigned seats on the 4 ."
1.0,"Istanbul to London Heathrow. The plane itself was old,  we found the  airline food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not  permitted to bring our laptops on the plane back, had to be  checked in for security purposes. This meant that when I was at Ataturk airport we  did no less than 3 separate security checks. 1 before check in, one after check in and one before getting on the plane. Because we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing  to do for the 4 hours  on the plane. Norwegian offers free wifi so I could check my phone on the plane. British Airways need to improve their service levels."
1.0,"Bad service and attitude all round.  Worst fiasco was when my flight from London was cancelled due to failure of their systems. BA refused to rebook us at the airport, instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to Milan via Madrid a  day later. BA are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel,  food and refreshment costs.  We were stranded at the airport, no help to find a hotel, zero customer care or empathy. Premium prices for a Ryanair  flight service. "
8.0,"On to Santiago , Chile. I was flying premium  economy with BA  was surprised that I got a  room (2 seats on the left side) for my  flight The seat was spacious and  even with an  extra neighbour seat, I would have  had enough space  to feel very  relaxed However, Lufthansa on the A380  (& Y+) gives  a bit more  seat space (at least it seems  to me). The  leg recline was  good as well as the ife ater (big screen, wide choice of programs of which I chose to  listen to some BBC concerts). The crew didn't impress me but was very friendly and helpful. The food  is extraordinarily good  ( chicken I had was very delicious) with sufficient  options (cheese, salad,  pasta The frittata  for breakfast wasn't  great however. I  did like that  they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival  ( bit early). Overall I had  a good experience with BA and  could definitely fly again as all  my things (seat, ground, service, staff)  went like expected  and dinner was  well above average). Premium economy is a good value  the money, especially  after a 15  hour flight."
8.0,"Flew a now ageing B777 flight BA 0053 to  Mt Pleasant flight with actually quite  nice fillet steak  as main meal.  Great choice of  cider / beer  after meal and  wine with glass  cold Prosecco when boarded. Comfortable seat  but it's the  real bug bear  with 8 across  with ""over the  shoulder access to  main aisle. Fortunately  we were in the last row  and my wife was in the  first seat with direct aisle access.  Now we could look at each other and not at a total stranger. I know  people are saying that they are  getting direct aisle access for everyone  into Club Class but this can't  change soon enough , and 8  which is not  even a Premium  seat in the present circumstances, is  the Absolutely terrible In Flight Entertainment system - although  I was On  Board the aircraft , fitted with  a very ancient  and blurry, old , awful audio  on your own  noise reducing headphones)  but a pretty  decent choice of  the FA's great  equipment and gave  excellent service. But  my main drawback  of BA is  its insistence that, having paid for  a premium service, we then have  to pay handsomely  upfront to pre-reserve  our seats (up to £105 per  seat per journey!).  – Not what I expect from a flag carrier . We refuse to pay this  outrageous sum -  the choices have  already noted on  a loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got  them together so . So, although  I had quite  a pleasant flight to Seattle with  us in Club,  with Virgin Atlantic  in the same , we will  fly their Upper Class over Clubworld , we can 't reserve our  seats for free with them."
7.0,"Flew London Gatwick to Tirana Rinas.  Bag drop at  BA was basically  seamless and BA  were offering to  bring in your  checked baggage for  FREE The flight  left at 8:10 and the gate  were supposed to be shown at  10 am, which  was oddly specific,  but as we  drew closer to  that time, that  gate got more  & more delayed. Until we finally  had our gate  number at around  10 For which  I had already  booked Boarding was  pretty much seamless.  My cabin crew greeted all the  passengers which was nice. The legroom  was alright, perfectly fine for a  three and and  one half hour . Good recline aswell. I don’t  know why British  Airlines opted for  food on board,  as free food  as before was  perfectly fine. Although  our food offering  were just a  few sandwiches which  were quite expensive.  Since there was no real hot  lunch options, just a few of  the sandwiches could be served hot. Flights were on time. Flights cost  about £320 return  per person, which  was quite pricey considering the cheapest  flight was around  twice the price. So overall, it’s  another good option,  so if you  could find something  cheaper then go for it."
8.0,"London Heathrow to  Madrid and back. A few problems at Heathrow with the wrong gate  being shown (BA ) staff didn't seem to care this was an  inconvenience but the  staff were excellent, comfortable and on . I really don't mind paying  off the food  & drink inflight,  same as you can pay using  the Murcia airport also a joy. Small, efficient and friendly. I will only fly BA  on short haul in Europe. Very impressed."
1.0,"London to Amsterdam. BA's service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight's experience really takes the  cake I should now be in Amsterdam - however, I am still writing this from London despite spending over 4 hours  boarding a plane to nowhere. We  were just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. Shortly after, we were told that the routes north of LHR were shut, and no planes were taking off. About an hour into  this ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. One more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. After 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or  so later. We did then leave the gate, and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. We were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that AMS would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we  should have arrived, so our flight wad cancelled. We taxied back to the gate, where we waited a further 10-15 minutes for ground staff to become available. I must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very good. The crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and watered. This is the full extent  to my praise though. Little was I to know that the real disaster was still to come. BA's ground handling was attrocious. We were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. However, BA had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthy. Vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because ""all the rooms were full"". I have never heard anything like it. This is beyond unbelievable. No assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situation. Further, the promised ""rebooking"" staff had all gone home - I was told  please consult the BA app the following morning. BA's app has rebooked my flights - two days later,  so my trip was for three days total. The feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so I can replan my trip for another weekend, is broken. I guess I'll be <mask> out their call centre in the morning. This <mask> all simply appalling. We all understand that adverse weather happens. But to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. Moreover, BA surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. Why they could not have prioritised the AMS flight over flights to 24-hour airports I do not know. And as for the ground handling, I have never had an experience this bad. BA staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to Heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the ""we don't work for BA excuse"". I've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn't have handled it better. By contrast, I don't <mask> how BA could have handled this worse. They really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days, save for the good lounges if you fly business."
3.0,"London to Abu ja via London.  Despite being a Gold Member of  my Executive Club  you try to  avoid British Airways  most days and  now I've reminded  myself why. Flight  crews don't afford  Old fashioned courtesy  customer service. I'm not saying they  are rude, just  saying they don't  have a decent level of customer  service You get the basics and good luck if you want to  catch their attention.  You walk up  & down the  line without making eye contact. No  staff at the  other end on arrival which I guess you have  to live with, however the way they deal with  you is appalling.  could care less I feel. 3hr  wait on return ! Seems BA is unsure if  you want to  offer a budget  airline or a  serious contender."
4.0,"Flight to Denver  to London. I almost missed my  flight because at  work I had  to complete some  very important papers that took 40  hours -   but no one  thanked me for  these papers. Flight  into Heathrow was  about what you  expect from a  3 hour flight.  At Heathrow the  plane lasted me  about 30 minutes.  As I boarded  my next the plane a lack  the leg room,  I was less  than the flight .  The flight then was  pretty much okay,  my food was  great had pasta  with tomato sauce  served several times drinks, the flight  attendant was kind and helpful. But  my plane had no paid Wi-Fi,  USB outlets or  docking ports, the  ratings were low ."
3.0,"Back to Gatwick. If it wasn't for Avios and  a fantastic deal  like this can make flying BA if you collect  it and use  the Club for  the tickets within , I would never fly BA  with the current product. The cabin was old, cramped , dirty. The  wait crew were  rude and surly.  But buy-on-board is still a massive  disappointment - we  are on award tickets but think  that is unacceptable  the food not to be complimentary. "
3.0,"Flight to Amsterdam.  Another delayed BA  flights by 55 % Old airplane,  old staff. Delays  become so regular  and staff have  very casual attitude  about delays. Another  sad show from  European Airways. "
1.0,Gatwick to Barcelona  Airport Check in  quick and friendly and helpful staff. Staff very welcoming  on lounge and  on board flight.  Unfortunately the in flight product has  changed - salad  is out so  limited food option for business class  flight - had  better have sandwich. Seats dirty and no middle seat  available although business class. No priority boarding for business passengers. Really disorganized  at boarding -  sorting people by groups and lines  getting mixed up. On arrival no  update and trying  the get update  - no update. Trying to get  update on baggage after 12 hours  - no update. .
8.0,"I thought it time BA deserved some compliments given so many negative comments that are common these days. I was fortunate to travel Hong Kong to London return in Premium Economy recently. Being able to check-in at the downtown Hong Kong Airport Express station is a real bonus as is using  the good Qantas Lounge at Hong Kong. I found the on-board service and operations a lot improved over the last time I flew long-haul with BA.. The new Group Boarding sequence system mostly seems to work, although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on - but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at  the gates. Food and wine on-board was quite good and overall service excellent, including recognising my One World Status. BA has the best in-flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in-flight programs. I also particularly welcomed  an excellent service from 'Goswami' who found me a window seat for LHR-HKG when returning and when using the First Lounge at Heathrow. All-in -all made for an enjoyable experience, a rarity these ."
7.0,"Faro to Gatwick. Club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at Faro. BA now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here, which sadly is absolutely awful! It feels like an average office , with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. It’s really very  small and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it’s a pathetic offering. Food was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and  we barely ever had any glasses or plates available. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to  enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Once on board, I have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome, a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else’s seat. I was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew  offer to help at all, instead  of looking mildly annoyed that I was temporarily blocking the aisle in  order to retrieve it. Priority disembarkation and baggage at Gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly."
7.0,"Gatwick to Faro.  The check in at Gatwick is very quick and  efficient and fastrack  it is also  extremely efficient and  you were quickly through to the  main lounge. The  room itself is  very nice, spacious  and to have  loads of seating  options and different  styles of seating,  but it also  felt very cosy  yet welcoming. The lounge was clean and tidy and  the were pretty  decent food options  offered including some  great scones with  whipped cream and  cheese As always  the drinks offering  from BA lounges  was great. The  new boarding by  rail seems to  have working quite  good and BA  flights are finally  becoming the priority .. long may  this continue! On  board was the  country club Europe  Club which while  nothing exactly luxury  or standard for  BA now and for a 3 hour flight is , BA don’t  really seem to  have a welcome  mat on short  distance flights which  seems a shame  because there is  lots of time  after the initial  flight rush is complete, there was  absolutely no personal  touch or greeting of any kind..  Just a quick  & simple gesture  and should be  expected on any  BA carrier. I 'd also like  a see menus handed out before  take off, which  could be done  at the same  manner as a  lounge The food  and drink offering  to board is  great although food  is typically over  priced and with  little presentation. Overall a decent enough  service and for  a reasonable price,  however a few small touches would  make it feel  much better."
6.0,"Jeddah to Chicago , London. The flight from Jeddah to Heathrow wasn't as good as  i expected, ground staff at Jeddah some of them were rude. Also,  a new baggage restriction for the  flights to the  US made the trip uncomfortable, I had to check my carry-on bag at the gate because my laptop  case and the Power bank were there, they took my laptop when I dropped my bags and they  tell me there is no need to take the chargers. However, The crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious too. The flight from LHR  into Chicago was full and the crew were helpful  and generous.  I won't fly  on BA again until they change their baggage restrictions for the Saudi flights."
1.0,"London to Frankfurt. I need to fly BA for Business frequently, as I don't have other choices. Not only planes are delayed (as today), but the lounges in Heathrow are a joke. I  rarely use them anymore as they are overcrowded, and they don't serve proper food, just snacks. Their customer service is horrible  and never helps me with any requests. Their business class in Europe  is economy class  with a free seat next to  you"
9.0,"On to Malaga.  After booking the tickets, I realised  that by choosing  two flights in  Europe the fare  is cheaper than  before once I 've added suitcases and pay for  meals onboard, I  had flown BA  twice in Europe for a while and was looking  forward to it. I was nicely impressed. My outbound flight was a wet-lease by Titan  so this was  not full BA service. The crew were very good ; they were  helpful and polite without being sugary  and I was  quite impressed by  the quality and  comfort of the  service together with  their selection of  seats The only  complaint is that  in both legs  one suitcase did  not come out  top priority despite  getting tagged correctly."
7.0,Bermuda to Gatwick. Usual window and Aisle seat taken. Crew friendly enough  even when all meal options had cheese (including sandwiches)  but good when  you cannot eat cheese. Breakfast usual . OK but not really worth the money paid. Seats clean and comfortable just feel it is time for BA to  change seats so  I do not need to pole  up over other  peoples legs to  see out from the window seat in the night.
6.0,"Flight to Boston  via London Heathrow. I found the  seats weren't wide  open and leg room was restricted. On the way  home to London  a person in  charge of me  took the seat  width as well  and this severely , and room ier had to  do Also the  narrow seats meant that I really  had to avoid  taking up both arm rests. Otherwise  these were good flights with, slightly  less choices, but  decent food. Extensive  drink options/variety as well. "
8.0,"Welcome to Hamburg. Baggage self-check-in was diabolical ... machines  being either slow or not working. Boarding commenced early, resulting in on time departure. Seat for this short flight was quite comfortable and better  that most European carriers. However the total lack of any kind of  service was poor. I don't expect a meal but  even a drink of water would  of been something.  People were friendly , the flight on time."
2.0,"From London Heathrow  to Hong Kong  for British Airways.  The premium economy  but the experience  is anything but.  Check yourself in,  select and scan  your own baggage  bags and load  everything onto the  flight yourself. Unsurprisingly  tedious process, and  takes over an  age for the  three passengers ahead  let us in . Hardly a  helpful service attendant  in sight. Better service with Ryanair,  I hate to  admit it."
2.0,"Flying to Istanbul with British Airways  on 5th June. At the passport/visa check desk, presented  the boarding pass  and the BA lady - my wife was holding  both passports. The lady looked at the boarding passes and barked 'Passports' as if she  could not see my wife holding them. Second bark: 'Do you have  your visa?'. Third : 'Show me'.  Fifth bark: 'Next'.  No smile, no  handshake or 'Good !' Hardly any  personal contact either. If anything, the situation was worse  than boarding. BA  has introduced a  buddy system. All  boarding systems need  to be policed,  so there are  ways of policing  these arrangements. Some  passengers attempted to  board before their group number was call. When caught  near the gate  staff they were told, 'Not Yet'. Some attempted to  board prematurely more  that once. On  a second attempt,  security staff told  passengers to wait.  Given that the  priority must be . BA gate  staff should be  properly trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers  and reminded that not everyone speaks  or understands English."
7.0,"Jet to London , with British  Columbia I booked  a flight online  just 3 months  ahead of my  scheduled travel date  and thought I 'd give this  airline another try  despite a bad  trip earlier in  this year. I give full marks  of BA on  each occasion in  both areas of  service I arrived  in the airport rather stressed as  the mobile phone  having been stolen  from a Salzburg  gift shop. The  BA agent was  very professional and  friendly towards me and entered into  conversation very willingly.  Everyone was professional  very pleasant and  quite efficient too.  Our flight was  on an A320  and boarding was  handled well and  cabin staff well  dressed too. The  flight crew were  professional and orderly.  Whenever there was  some delay it  is managed well  by the cabin  manager explained matters  on the flight , I bought  the overpriced tea  so felt very comfortable. Arrival was  through a remote stand and then  a bus. Overall , very good  experiences with BA."
10.0,Starting service on  a flight from Edinburgh-Florence on 7  May 18. Mainline  British Airways could  get lots from  a CityFlyer and  its franchise partner  ( S Africa  Capital Air).
1.0,"from Heathrow to  Dubai It was outrageous of British  Airways to put  BA on a  single boarding pass  when I checked  out at LHR  in the 05/07. I bought, paid and the the  booking was confirmed  2 months before  the flight date.  How dare BA  do this to  ME when I 'm travelling for  3 hours and  they ran like  like clock work (different airlines) until  we encountered BA  in Heathrow. Check-in and help desk  were arrogant, rude  and are as  rude as hell.  Not even a  sincere apology for the amount stress  they caused me just here is  a £5 voucher  to wait till 40 minutes before  departure to see  that you have  a seat. we  have 12 passengers  that had the  worst treatment from BA. British Airways  are a disgrace of an airline,  if they have  the monopoly on  all Heathrow slots  and think they can get a way with such disgraceful service, well,  we are wrong,  among others I  have found an  alternative airline. I  write my review and say I will never ever  fly British Airways again. I would  rather walk to  London"
2.0,Going to Madrid.  The seat allocation has led to  the husband and  myself not sitting  comfortably  I  think I can  fight to get  a seat I  need but other  than having a  chair next to  my husband I don’t want any  particular seat. We  were travelling as  one pair. There are three seats  either side of  an aisle. There  will likely be  some passengers travelling  and have chosen  one seat preventing  me from sitting  there as they  all know what groups are travelling and do t  care where they  are BA bothering to do the  seats allocations for  them the passengers  that don’t wish  and pay for specific seats would  do this. 
3.0,"Being broken into  and no explanation.  Now the good point. Cabin attendants  are very diligent  and friendly in  business class on  the London to  Shanghai on 22  July Not so . The bizarre  seat pattern that  has 8 business  economy seats across  the width of the plane feels  awkward and crowded  compared to a  seating arrangement. The  rule breaker. Upon  arriving in Shanghai  my was not  The only one  aboard BA169 reporting  lost luggage. Mine  was 3 days  later and the  luggage locking mechanism  having been forced  out and damaged  by repair or  previous use. Nothing  was missing, so  is it subject  to search as  standard luggage? People  expect an answer  if luggage arrives  to that state.  We have not  provided any explanation  or queries to  Customer Relations; this  was not acceptable.  A behaviour like  this not only  shuts down the  airlines but leaves  an impression that  exceeds and outweighs  the efforts made  of their own cabin staff."

1.0,"Flight to London : Having booked  or paid for  the leg room  for six months  into advance we  are unpleasantly surprised  we find out  that upon checking  a booking on  our BA website  A couple of  weeks before flying  there had been  no change of aircraft. Our new  flights were shown  as exit row  23 and we  had assumed that  this would be  extra leg room  when upon boarding  and realised that  row 22 of  the A321 aircraft  were standard seat . Why didn't  they notify us  of a seat  switch when they  heard of this  six weeks in  front of our  flight Once we'd  landed we found  that there was  no extra leg  space seat still available which was  nice because my  husband is tall  so needs that  added leg room.  Our BA cabin  manager did move  my husband but  explained ""this happens  half the time  on row 22,  this might be  in exit row  and it's not extra leg room""."
5.0,"I recently took a first class flight from London Heathrow to Las Vegas and due to a plane change a number of people where upgraded. The plane  were not ready for passengers and we boarded 35  minutes late. When we boarded things  where still not ready and the staff were rushing around. The service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and dated. The return flight was a disaster. The seats  got dirty, food was like rubber, plane was dated, seats smelt, Lauren Perrier was not served on takeoff  for some reason, some new policy apparently and again  they had upgraded people in first which is not great. When I complained I was  offered 8,000 Avios, are you serious BA? I think there are many  other airlines out  there with a first class product  it is much  nicer than that I experienced on British Airways. Unless a first class ticket on British Airways is on sale, I would suggest you fly  with another airline. British Airways planes  look dirty they have been told a number of  time they are dirty - it’s about time they  had a  thoroughly clean and re-model the first class it’s getting  really old, it’s  still club class  with a few tweaks."

1.0,"Back to Heathrow. British Airways are not doing us proud. I recently flew back from South Africa with some sports equipment. Their web site states that you  can take sports  equipment as part of your luggage , but I was charged £65  and bring my  equipment back. The  officers in staff were very forceful and abrupt. As  we had to bring the bike back, I had no choice but to pay. When  we got back  they contacted their customer service, they  are not willing to help.  Also, the seats  keep getting really  cramped The food is terrible. "

1.0,"British Airways changed  rules and consequently , separating family  in business class.  No co-ordination at  Rome and apparently  just one BA  engineer at Rome  Airport who I could speak to.  Had to call  in customer service  at UK which  proved a waste of time. Given  the seats but upon boarding could  not take seat  as engineers trying  and secure cabin  seats in changed  seats Failed to  notice this and  boarded the plane  leaving it unsecured  the pilot did  indeed want to  do take off , Advised stewardess but they did  NOT care. Could nt recline seat  in fear of  a divider falling  and curtain was  out front of  us Waste of  money paying to  fly business class  at BA.   They did make  me wear a  safety belt upon  taking off so  when the bulk head fell we  did not get  out of the  aircraft"
8.0,"Welcome to Edinburgh  and London. I'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I  have always had  a great experience  at BA in terms of in-flight service and airport handling. After sales service can be a different experience! This flight I arrived a little late at the  door due to  technical issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl was such a  joy She calmed me down, reassured  everyone and helped me get through security swiftly. I  was able to  secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am  really glad I ! The service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight.  I thought the seat was tremendously  comfortable and comfortable, even for the  extra upgrade price,  2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than  1 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. But I was comfortable, a good temperature  & had a great choice of films. My connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to  poor weather, but  I was handled  very nicely. All in all I'm glad I flew  BA for this ."
6.0,"Mumbai to London Heathrow. Disappointing experience. I wouldn't book business class again,  seems like bad value for money. I've flown economy and premium economy  and found economy  noisy and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter  environment and more . I expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn't see an upgrade  for comparison to the huge extra cost. The staff weren't that attentive , I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol , then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the  beginning of the flight. I had  another person ask if I needed anything who then brought me the tea I requested.  Security staff were helpful when I saw them but overall what a waste of money. I paid an  estimated £500+ for better food on  my tray with . Really not worth it!"
7.0,"Flying to London.  having read many  negative reviews about  UK Airways I  took my flight fully expecting to  be a bad  flight but ended  up feeling completely  happy with all  parts of the  airline It is  far too easy  to glamourise the  modern days but in its seeming  superiority British Airways  was no different  than other European  airlines As a  result of the  experience I hear Dutch people saying  that the same  of KLM, their  national airline, and  some friends say  the same about Air France. The  passenger service was  good and friendly,  if a little lacking in charm. The food was  more than adequate.  Their in-flight entertainment  is adequate too.  Am not sure  if the extra one pays for  Cost Plus is  really worth it  on terms of  quality food, but  the space and  relative quietness that  comes with a  small cabin matters,  and it is  worth it. When  it landed at  London a shortage  in ground staff  means that we  remained stuck in the plane for  30 minutes before  anyone could be  able to operate the bridge to  drop us off.  Some people with  other flights were  also beginning to  panic but the  staff handled the  issue admirably. They  less than rose  on the occasion  to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were  needed"
4.0,"When you travel British Airways its like you are lucky to be able to be  on British Airways staff. Right from the start the check in girl  in business told  me the flight was closed which was a load  o rubbish 1 hr and 10 minutes before the flight. She spent  20 minutes on  the phone to  me to see  that it was  so late. Because  I need special  equipment they didn't have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife  had to do it. My wife now very stressed and I arrive  with the finger and when we could see that  flight was still  open I asked  another man on  his desk about  it closed and  he said nonsense.  My wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. The guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair  I was actually  taking a long  way The cabin layout has 7  seats across whereas  all the other 787's I have been on have  4 That means  people are squeezing  into another seat and it is  a very narrow  so cabin crew  grabbed my arm  any time they  pass by. Of course the 787 is a great aircraft. So for me the seat  was below my  knees I was also amazed that  we had to  charge £190 to reserve seats, I  would pay anything  for other airlines.  The food was  just OK nothing exciting and the  quality of films was not that  bad but then  that is all  about choice. In my opinion fly with a different airline if you  do there are seriously better airlines who don't have snobs working for them."
10.0,British Airways gets  loads of well  timed kickings but  my return flight  into Gibraltar was . On time  on arrival in  London smiling friendly  staff excellent hot  drinks and plentiful  wifi Gatwick lounge  is too small really but we found seats ok. Gibraltar lounge for  another dozen or  two club passengers  was relatively huge.
3.0,"The First Class  are not even that any more.  Contrast with the lounge in T3;  this may be  a offshoot of  the fine Concorde  cabin in T5,  but it need  not feel like  another rural train ? Poor food,  mediocre drinks and  largely indifferent staff  did not compare  to LH facilities  on FRA or  Emirates There is  poor ground assistance,  so boarding was haphazard. Fine Cornish  tea was offered , happily quaffed. The seat was OK, but not  at the same  level as the  premium AC J class pods, and not close to  Air Emirate's suites. Small things like the menu presentation,  and sufficient food  ( are a  majority of seats in F), seat comfort (OK, but  not special) and the toilets (small and curiously offering  only paper). The  staff were very friendly; the service  was decent in  L but poor  for BA, your  sales drive to  rock bottom is  catching up with  passengers and your  first Class product is not worth  the name anymore.  We can only  imagine that BA  was trying to  stick it out  as they drive  off paying passengers  from other airlines  who place a serious effort to  deliver a superb  cabin product. And  poor wi-fi"
1.0,"On to London.  the morning of the departure I  had an email  or a text  messages from that  informing me that  the flight had  been canceled, with no specified reason.  Seeking an alternative  they rerouted me on a night flight to Madrid, then to Palma, to arrive the next day in Birmingham. Disappointed of  the disservice I called the customer service in England  and waited 40 mins at my expense before being able to speak  to an operator)  and I was offered a flight in the evening at 1900, which  would not help  us to arrive in time to  the appointment and  I declined. I had to find the only possible  flight that would  allow me to  get to London in time, unfortunately it was a last minute flight  to another company that cost me a fortune. On  account of it,  because the flight would arrive no  less at Heathrow but at Stansted, I had to pay the taxi £70 more than the agreed amount  once I arrived at Heathrow. British Airways did not  claim responsibility, I was not reimbursed  the new flight  I had to  take last minute nor the taxi . They did  NOT show concern for the inconvenience  and the stress . The worst  has been the  failure of their customer Care saying  I was not  my responsibility!"
1.0,"Flew British Airways from JK to  Newark Heathrow then  via London Galwick to Rome. Bag has been lost  over 48 hours.  Zero email, phone , text update. They didn’t even answer my email! My wife and  I have had  exact same clothes on our backs since we left JFK. Thank goodness , washing machines.  I have missed  up on events. We can’t get into certain places due to dress codes. We had to wait for  the store to open to buy  makeup and toothpaste.  Really horrible service.  And we were told our bag would arrive at our hotel at  1 pm yesterday.  Now almost 1 am the next day and the  bag still isn’t . "
3.0,i have flown  US Airways numerous  times over many . Sadly the  service has deteriorated  very recently and  our flight was  very poor. The  staff were offhand  - one seemed  genuinely unhappy to  get there. The  woman next to  me and I  looked for the  food choice but  were told that  there was none  available - too  few had apparently  been loaded. There  was no apology  - we were  just told we  needed to make  our choice. We  paid for the  choice After some  time we were  given our meals  we found we  have both been  offered a vegetarian ! I had  to walk down  into the galley  and let them  in and was  informed in a  similar offhand manner  - they must  not recorded the  food choice -  without apology. Eventually  I received the  food which by  far was dry  but not enjoyable.  They were asked  about breakfast choices  but gave in  reply which stated  we wanted a  breakfast choice 40 minutes before landing.  We were not  given anything. The  service was really  poor - and  like usual the  best seats were  right behind the  seats and comfort  and in other  words BA will  now have to  improve their product  or continue to  serve premium passengers.
10.0,"We can not  recommend the new  Club World' food and service, on  the 747 outbound  and 777 inbound , was great!  The food was  first class, the  decor very attractive,  the quality very  good - haven't  had such tender  meat on any  plane before (or  at a restaurant  For that matter ), and the  French style crockery/glass  was stylishly upmarket.  Truly worlds away  form what it  use to be,  flight crews were  so friendly and  knowledgeable Really liked  he way the  beds came out  in a trolley , you could  mix and choose  what you liked  or mix and  change if you  needed to. You  could get a  padded day blanket,  soft padded blanket  for night and  the mattress protector type thing to  keep on the  back of your  body much better  that the thin  and static blanket  you used to . The pillow  is larger and  much better than before. Can't believe  how fast the  plane flew and  how well we  did on landing  back in Seattle  - once home !! We do  wish Club Europe  a shame as  when this level  the service and  hospitality is maintained  our new Club  world will be  another great success."
4.0,"Another disappointing experience - flew out on a 747 400 series (should be scrapped!) Departed late. Loaded aircraft  due for push back, no a/c Temperature was excessively hot all flight, no cool air. Personal Media system broken, split screen. Food quality diabolical. Moody flight attendants, ran out of  laundry soap. Return flight on A380 left on time, 100% better service, meal quality, and crew, definitely made up for outward flight. Been flying BA for over  10 years, probably  will be a last choice in future - sad to see."
2.0,"Flight to London.  Half full. Overhead  was full of  people Seat excruciatingly  loud and headphone that worked intermittently.  Got off about  2030 local time.  Last meal appeared  on about 2030 local time. Menu  included seasonal salad  with one small piece of lettuce and cucumber), braised  prime rib of beef or mushroom ravioli pasta, with  fresh pecan cake. Only 3 beef meals available. Choice  was either pasta or to go , I chose  that latter and dined on a small bottle of  champagne and half a cup of  fruit juice. Breakfast  ( light refreshment including juice, tea and coffee) consisted  only a cream  cheese roll, and oat biscuit, and half a cup  with warm tea  about 30 minutes later. We paid extra for World  Class Plus but  we consider that  we were conned. Customer services have been useless and on the second  morning of writing  we received the  same response, ""Thanks  for coming back  for us. I completely understand why  but disappointed we  could offer you  our full catering  package especially as on such a  long haul flight.  We hope our staff explained our  food supplier had  some unexpected problem  with the systems they use to  run their catering.  That meant they couldn’t provide a  complete meal service and I absolutely  guarantee this isn’t  how you would  expect when you  booked with us.  Very sorry we’ve  turned you down.""  Which is it. Thank you BA.  This is the  first time we  will ever book long haul with  BA"
4.0,"London to Zurich. The airline isn’t bad. Their boarding procedure was very good, though the aircraft was very old. I know it is one of the oldest, and personally I enjoyed it. But  again I have  you be realistic,  it very old, loud and uncomfortable. The service isn’t good either, you don’t even get a cup of  coffee It’s great to hop to London, but don’t expect any kind  a special treatment or service."
7.0,"Glasgow to New York JFK via  London Outgoing flight was on a refurbished 747. Still I could see its age. We had a duo seat at the back of the plane. The plane was hot and  there are no air con vents  above your head. The IFE was decent and had  very good selection.  The cabin crew , looking after  us was pleasant and friendly and  we chatted to  me Flight left  close to on time. Service was quick as we  are first served at the back.  Guests were given  snacks and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later, which was vegetarian pasta for me. Adequate amount of food  served and was tasty. Ice cream and juice/water was served halfway through the flight. We then received a  snack before landing  that was a sandwich and a toblerone. It was ok. Return flight  to Vegas was on a old  Boeing Horrible old  747 with no padding and very dirty. Service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff. Less drinks served, again food was ok chicken curry this time. Small snack of  an egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast. IFE was horrendous on the old , tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice. I wouldnt fly BA again if  I had a  ticket because they charge such a large amount for  just the duo  and £210 return it cost us  plus it made  the air fare expensive. Also the planes they use are too old and tatty."
5.0,"Flew on a  last minute emergency trip London Heathrow to Baltimore with BA. Most disappointing feature on this  journey was the aircraft the new  BA 787. I found the aircraft  very small and  cramped for transatlantic routes, in its 3-3-3 seating configuration, despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard, the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the  larger aircraft I 've flown on other transatlantic routes, 777, 767, A340 and 747. BA needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class, also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid, with no individual regulation.  I felt to me more like  someone crammed in  to a Boeing 737 on a  short flight."
1.0,"Just this year,  my wife and  myself travelled business  way with BA  connecting Dublin to  London returning from  Camden Town, thru  departures in each ). Having paid  economy class fares,  they were then  really taken aback  and have to  pay an additional  charge for seat  selections on the  longer haul sectors.  Having we not  booked seats, we  might have found , not just  two but possibly  only one of  them on the  upper deck and one on the  upper deck of  an A380 on  their way out  on the 747  for the return  flight We therefore  felt no choice.  What sort of  customer retention policy  does this? No  western airline with  whom we have  travelled business class  has then charged  on seat selection,  and BA just  cant seem to . It is  a rip-off. The  rear facing business  flight seat plan  for BA planes  is really unattractive,  compounded further by  trying to climb  over a sleeping  bag to reach  the aisle from  your window seat.  People should take  one look at the Emirates A380  when they want  a see a  customer friendly layout. This was our first business class  journey with BA. Having flown with  more eastern airlines  before we have  discovered how much  cheaper the play boys actually are."
1.0,"Los Angeles to  Dallas I booked  the AA, LAX to LHR round trip very far in advance. BA is AA partner. Paid for the BA seat selection early to get  good seats. BA  canceled the flights (coming and going),  but did not inform AA or  BA that the  flights were canceled.  Half of my text and phone number was entered with BA with my passport number. They should have contacted me. I  found out a couple days before  my flight because  they happened to  want to do a meal request.  It turns out that BA shifted  the smaller planes and I actually spent six hours, over two days  trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch up with a tour. All they said , we can't  help you. I  kept calling and  texting and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, Premium Economy was awful. Food was terrible. We had pre paid $276  and choose seats. There were no  empty seats left. We ended up  taking a night flight right next  to the toilets.  That meant the smell, people are bumping into you,  bathroom lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. Same seats  back home. I  would have been  best off flying in coach. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat . I tried  to get this  when my return flight started because I was still  trying and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our  next flight and to get our refunds.They wouldn't refund. After returning, I made five phone calls and spent  45 mins filling out a detailed request online. Called  back today, was  denied twice and told there is nothing I could do. It is  possible I may get a response  in a month  to my email request. Don't ever  travel with them!  BA used to  have the finest  system in the skies but now  that system is broken and there is no such  thing as customer service. If you have a problem, you will be  down a famous creek without a paddle. They have  an endless loop , calling, waiting on line, their agent's can't or won't do anything but sell seats. I spoke to many many supervisors, no results. There  is no one to solve problems. They pass the buck, have you  filled out forms online and no  one responds."
3.0,"My overall flight wasn't too bad.  Everyone and everything  looked comfy enough, although my girlfriends  laptop didn't work  for either the outbound or inbound  flights and little  attempt was made  towards a resolution.  Please understand that  it isn't the  cabin attendants fault,  etc but it would have been  nice if a  bit more effort than 'there's nothing we can do' was given to  that issue! On  my flight from  Miami to Tampa  we were stuck on the aircaft  by approximately 30-40 minutes as the  plane 'wasn't where it should be' which once again  presents the worst problem In the  beginning but after  the long flight isn't particularly what  I wanted! It wasn't the best  experience "
4.0,"BA’s Galleries lounge at CPT is adequate but let down by a  mediocre food selection (including packaged cheese and biscuits, with flimsy wooden knives) and limited wine choices. Champagne was  sorely lacking. Toilet  water wasn’t being  done in the toilets and here was no lock  in one of  three cubicle doors. There were no  TV screens, so one had to wait for the  phone call to  answer Boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. Seats 62J/K on the upper deck are the best  of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. Take off was on schedule. FAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. The food was the  weakest we've ever experienced in Club World. The 'smoked chicken salad' was  appalling and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. The  Southern Company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts.  Very little one can do to remedy a hard seat. Landing was ahead of schedule.  Quite a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub-par business class product. British Airways are falling ever behind their  competition"
2.0,"Back to San Jose. I’ve just  booked onto a BA flight from Gatwick to Costa Rica, an 11.5 hr flight, and can honestly I haven’t seen a screen with so few pixels since the 90s. I  fly other  air haul flights and none of BA’s competitors are  providing such low quality entertainment.  I used to  thought of British Airways as being  a premium airline  but now they’re  all rubbish."
8.0,"I took the  cheap option of  a new Toronto to London Gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route. Cheaper than the Heathrow  flight it was an interesting experiment in whether I could fall back in love with Gatwick. Excellent check in at Pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party lounge. Goodness knows what  we were thinking, given the old lounge was well  maintained with excellent  seating and food . The Premium  Economy lounge is cheap and nasty. On time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the  BA traffic to have built up). The cabin was  three third full. Juice and water offered. No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not  coming to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable. On time departure, and a fast drinks service. This is my first experience of Gatwick crew. Fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet  of serving Heathrow.  ( all over 25!) The meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. As the  lounge was empty,  I went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. Awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese  sandwich served before . IFE on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights  over Christmas! An  easy arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. Returning, I liked the biz / first class check in area  in LGW -  friendly and friendly.  BA lounge at Gatwick was streets ahead of Heathrow. Self serve Champagne and loads of seats. Kept very  warm and plenty of food. An  addition to biz was nice on a full flight. Efficient boarding and a fast coat  of drink and  meal service. A really fast bar , only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of  short haul cabin crew from Heathrow. The only thing  that spoilt it was off duty BA staff in Biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while  sitting in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. An early  arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very  slow with no power in Premium Economy. (currently going through a refurb progamme), but with efficient and friendly crew and on time / early performance - there  is little to dislike, and I even liked Gatwick!!"
10.0,"First time flying with British Airways  for economy on a Transatlantic flight from London to  Amsterdam I was impressed by the hard work of the professional and  experienced Flight Attendants. They walked up and down the  plane helping people  through various issues and offering good tasty meals, snacks , drinks of  various kinds. I will definitely fly British overseas again  given a chance. The economy seats on this old but well kept Boeing 747-400 were very comfortable and I am a  6 x 240lbs and still did  NOT feel cramped.  So would encourage  ALL my friends to fly British if they want  a have a  nice comfortable flight from the US  to Europe. Thank You British Airways,  very good service indeed."
3.0,Geneva to Vancouver  to London. Worst experience. Terrible service and when we  complained with constructive  criticism they offered £25 voucher and  no apology - an insult as did not ask for compensation. It's an expensive price  to pay for a low cost airline. On a positive point the  Aberdeen to London flights were fine  but the 2  short haul flights  into Vancouver were  horrendous
8.0,It is the  first time I 've flown BA's  into Europe flying  via London Heathrow  from Corfu. I  am not expecting  a great deal  having read a  number of less  than positive reviews ; however I  am very pleasantly surprised. Shortly after  boarding we were  given a welcome  package with a  selection of nuts  and a choice  from magazine to  buy Not long  into this there  came a full  customer service followed  with a 4  course meal which  was very tasty.  I had cured  chicken followed by  chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and  another small cheese  sandwiches We were  then offered a  cup of hot  drinks and a  washing up of  water The crew were very attentive  and helpful. They  put a smile  on their face  all the time and the flight  seemed to zip ! The seats  were the usual  aisle seats with  one middle blanked  and a tray but for a  relatively short trip  this was fine.  This flight was  a upgrade using Avios and I  would happily do  so again. I  spent around 6500  Euros and an  extra £13 in  food which I  think was very  decent value for  what I had.
3.0,"Our original flight  was cancelled as my wife and  son were just disembarking from a  cruise ship. We were then advised shortly after by SMS that we  had been automatically  placed on a  plane the next day, to London Heathrow. This was not a lot  of good when our car was parked at Gatwick. I managed to get through to BA and was given a new booking to Gatwick also the following day. We were offered no other assistance by the  airline The following  morning we turned  back at the airport to find  a new flight was running 40  mins late. Having  successfully boarded the  plane we stayed  at the gate for about 45  seconds before the captain deigned to  tell us that  our delay was  being caused by  turbulence at Barcelona . Shortly thereafter  our captain advised  me that we  could wait for another two hours,  or we would be given water. This was quickly superseded by a  further announcement that a slot had become available at  short notice, so  our water was . The real  consequence of this  delay however, was  the Airways new  food service, whereby  passengers buy food and pay by card/Avios. This simply does not work.  Within one hour in the air, the trolley had  moved about nine  feet from the front of the  cabin Eventually a  cabin attendant attempted  to work from  his back forward  by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. About  10 minutes from  arrival he reached  out and we  ordered for two cans of drink and a packet  for crisps (potato ?). He returned  and tell us he had no  water and only one can, which we duly shared  among us. Having been on the  plane for three and a half  minutes this was  the only refreshment we could obtain.  I consider this  should be completely unacceptable. If this  represents the level of service we can now expect  from British Airways, there is no  use traveling with . The budget  airlines can do  more at lower cost."
2.0," Hong Kong to London. This was my first Business  class trip on BA, as I  currently use Emirates  & Cathay Pacific.  In comparison, BA  is a very  low standard. The  cabin attendant who served the section  before I was seated couldn't have cared less. No greetings when passengers boarded the plane,  no offer of help. He asked  about my drink order but never delivered the drink.  A second drink  ever offered. The toilet hadn't been  installed properly before boarding, and during  our flight, one  or the two  toilets became unusable, resulting in long queues. The seating arrangement - having  you face a  man who sits  from the opposite direction- is uncomfortable.  Absolutely appalling quality and little value for money."
10.0,"Washington to Bucharest  flight via London.  I was originally  flying in World Traveller Plus but  at Dulles check-in was offered a  Club World upgrade at just $499 , which I accepted - resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top-drawer service. The two London-Bucharest sectors both  went well. But all this was just a prelude  for my return trip. While in  Romania I sustained a fall and  though I wasn't seriously hurt it  is still difficult  going walk long distances especially with  my luggage. At the Bucharest airport  to drop the agent noticed my situation and offered  help which I accepted - and was promptly wheeled through security, passport control and the  ( long) corridors  to the gate,  then put aboard the plane. On  landing in London , was met  with more assistance  who whisk me  through the vastness  at T5 and onto the plane, this time with  the pleasant surprise : another Club World upgrade (this time for free).  While on the plane back to  Washington the cabin crew couldn't do  enough for me,  checking how I was doing, going  down meal choices (the menu this time round was  that bit heavy  on cheese and other dairy items  you really can't  recommend but ultimately  I still ate well), getting me drinks, and more. They were as professional and proactive  a crew as  we ever experienced in 40 years  of long-haul travel. Finally, once arrived  at Dulles more  help was waiting, right up to  booking my cab. What could have been an ordeal  for this return trip was turned into as relaxing  yet satisfying a travel experience as  could be imagined  - through the  years I've had mostly excellent experiences  with BA cabin crews and that's  a big reason  how I've stayed with BA all these years and will continue to do so. But a big standing ovation for the  flight and ground crews for these  awards for above-and-beyond service - you're  our best."
3.0,"Welcome to Warsaw. BA European service  was becoming like an expensive low  cost airline. The  level of seat  belts still remains high. The seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it was a 2-hour flight.  You can always  feel the elbows of the passengers  next to you  while someone is  crying I didn't  buy any food or drink onboard,  so I reckon it's not badly priced. The inbound  flight was on  the older A320, in which the  seat was reclining. </s>"
1.0,"Flight to Istanbul.  Thanks to poor  weather conditions at  Birmingham the flight  was initially delayed  another 2 hours  that is quite ! When the  pilots were informed  about the gate,  everyone gathered at  their 'A' gate  at T5. Then, no announcement and the ground staff  were in a world of their own. Next, there  was a screen  warning that the  plane will depart  on a C . Everyone rushes to the one  and the last , the 'C' . Once on  board the dreaded  news that the  flight will be  replaced by another . The flight finally takes off  after three hours ! After a  while the crew  start with the M&S gibberish but  they are so  good that by  this time the  crew serve the  last row in  Istanbul the sandwiches  were all over . I had  loads of crisps  on a diet  Coke for dinner.  The flight arrived  at Istanbul three  minutes late and to add insult  the injury, the  bus stops at  some remote gate  so we have  to trek to  another terminal. "
6.0,"Return to Cape  Town Flying first class with British Airways is a  tricky affair. But having secured a  pair of return  flights to Cape Town with Avios, our expectations were  understandably high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking. Unfortunately, Terminal 3 isn't the  perfect starting point . Galleries First  flight glamour -  with decent champagnes. The food on offer is adequate, although hardly first class. Hoping for  space on board,  I didn't use the sit down . Boarding was  good time and according to BA's new group allocation. Our seats -  3 and 3K - were a  first for us, as we've previously  opted for pairs  at the centre.  Our seats A  to K are  much superior, with more storage space  and better privacy. However, there's no  escaping the fact  of the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane, particularly when one inspects the  poor state of fittings in the  toilets and galley. The IFE is  clearly showing its  age and badly  in need of an upgrade. But  the least it  wont require rebooting on our flight.  Cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag. The FA looking after our side  seems to be  on the wrong job. Food was  better than usual,  although a malfunctioning oven meant that  passengers had to  spend 30 minutes  for our hot breakfast. Landing was  short of schedule and we were through immigration and  land reclaim within  15 minutes. Overall,  a decent flight but let down  by the attitude of the cabin  attendants and the  condition of the plane."
4.0,"Welcome to Hamburg.  Typically if I fly BA it  to SFO or  Chicago to LHR.  One time I  flew them from  Chicago via Tampa  and LHR to  Hamburg Using their  seat points I  booked a first  class seat which  of course is  a scam because  they charges you  fees and surcharges  that use those  points at $500  each direction. Their  BA operation appears  too be a poor second class  alternative to American as they use  most of their  boarding and check  out kiosks plus  only the American  first class (not) . All the  cheap processed slices , cheese and  popcorn you can  get with free booze is not  something I call  a premium lounge.  My BA gate  to the dreadful  Miami terminal is  open even on  their main floor  but downstairs. People  line up to  different entry points  for boarding which  created a mess  and boarding people  into sections. Boarding  was like a  phone call. BA  has one of  its oldest B747  in Miami and  they showed even  better first. The  floors were of  the older design  so it appeared  their carpet was  new but the  seats smelled of  stale carpet. The  coffee and food  looked surprisingly good  relative to their  flight out of  Chicago The flight  arrived late leaving  and late arriving,  as this Miami  flight does not  stop in terminal . Rather terminal  congestion and requiring  the passengers to  use shuttle buses  to the other  way which is  why I did  miss my connection  to Hamburg. In the end I  guess I was  disappointed with BA  but their service  quality for premium  passengers has   hit rock bottom.  Its Avios program  is nearly worthless  for any premium  ticket booking or  on its partner airlines. Try using  their points on  BA or Cathay  or even Alaska , you will  see it impossible  regardless how far  an advance you  can "
2.0,"India to London : Rubbish check-in  staff as bad  at Ryanair. I  told the staff  through mobile boarding  pass checked website , I have  3 x 32  kg bags checked ! One bag  weighed over 23  kg (27/28), they  refuse to honour  the 32 kg  bag and told  me I will  allow myself to  board the flight  but not able  at check in.  They were so  disrespectful and unhelpful.  This was with  the same unhelpful  and unprofessional staff  in the very  rude manner. Flight  was delayed without  the checked-in agent  doing anything, after  the passengers board  they start to  realise people there will be an hour or so  delay due to  delays At the  very least the  flight crew serve  passengers complimentary juice  & water during  the wait."
1.0,"When I checked  on the evening before for the  first flight, it looked like only 40% of seats  are occupied. 2 hrs before flight they cancelled it without rebooking or explanation. There is  now a hotline to call."
1.0,BA’s reputation has been declining for years so I  cannot use them.  After various reasons I had to  miss a flight  from Madrid. I had hand luggage. They texted asking  for the hand  baggage to be checked in as  their flight was busy. I did and they lost it. 7 hours later no luggage or idea where it is. No compensation - only after 12 hours and for a  small amount. Ridiculous airline which has managed to lose its prestige and good will. Lagging significantly behind EasyJet in all aspects.
1.0,"Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Desperately poor service from British Airways in Club Class. Business Class is utterly outdated, with the  infamous ""facing each-other ,"" and narrow / uncomfortable seats.  Even food served  was appalling. The  flight crew were inattentive at best, and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service. The problem with British  Airlines now in  Economy and Business Class, is what they are completely  missing namely, any  style or manners : Poor food, uncomfortable seats, terrible  / small movie , No WIFI  = an overall  bad airline experience. British Airways even  charge for seat selection too, which  added insult to  injury Avoid this  particular airline if you can. The only redeeming feature of this   service is the  very quiet Airbus A380. A shame  airlines ruin the  service with such  incredibly poor quality  service and attitude."
2.0,"From Heathrow to Mahon. Booked 9  days ago flights  with first family ) for 2  flights for 2 adults, 2 children , 1 infant  per lap (almost  identical for all  3 us. Pre-booked  tickets at the  right time. I  felt rather surprised  that I got  an email two  weeks out saying  that your flight  to Madrid on  the 26th May”  and I was  to direct Heathrow  to Menorca. Airline  assured me everything  was fine. Further  checking when self-service  was opened 24 h out, wife  and daughters checked  in fine, me  with my son  were referred to  for check-in (despite  us being on  the same booking). An urgent call  to BA I was told 1)  he was probably  just moved to  a bassinet position.  As I pointed  that this was utter nonsense she  smiled and said , infants can’t  get in online which I now  know is also  untrue My concern was well placed.  The BA T5  gate drop, check  out agent looked  for a note  on the booking  asking her to call various people  and after about  15 minutes she  handed me a  picture of boarding . Only after  I checked them she sheepishly admitted , our pre-booked  tickets were gone,  My son and  i had no  seats at all  but were standby,  whilst my wife  my daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16  inches apart). ‘Prebooked seating is not  legal you know!’  After kicking up  a huge fuss  I believe they  cannot legally sit  somewhere below a  specified age away  their parents?) the  flight manager offered me no explanation  other than full flights, but promised  us it would  get sorted once  she got round  the closing my  booking Fast forward  to the gate  to utter carnage  with the check-in  agent (who cant  of been more  then 22) in . When I  eventually got seen I was finally  given a seat number for me  with my son,  sitting many rows  back from the  rest of my  family As this was my sons  first ever flight,  I was absolutely  adamant that we couldn’t sit anywhere  near each other.  Add to that,  our son is  2 so how  we are going  ot manage feeding,  and needing toilet . I put  my foot down  and was eventually given a single  family seat two  rows again from  the daughters who were by now  all together thank  God We boarded  my flight pretty much last after  hearing the furore , holding my  son I get  to my assigned seat and someone  sits in it. Asking to see  the boarding pass  in surprise he  sat in the  next seat. Cue  cabin staff running ! and frantically <mask> boarding passes. <mask> is the <mask> that the <mask> crew have <mask> their own <mask> staff, I <mask> heard one of them mutter <mask> boarding cards <mask> flight numbers <mask> someone around <mask> is on <mask> wrong flight’! <mask> forward another <mask> mins and <mask> plane is now pushing back <mask> me standing <mask> an aisle holding my son <mask> not an empty seat on the plane with <mask> saying to <mask> wife that <mask> going to <mask> to get <mask> here and <mask> children in <mask> Much checking <mask> iPads and <mask> BA staff <mask> is then <mask> (there were <mask> a few <mask> the flight apparently) and hurriedly <mask> to the <mask> whilst an <mask> from the flight deck is <mask> out for <mask> to take <mask> seats or <mask> the flight <mask> seat?). Raised <mask> formal complaint <mask> was told <mask> they 'understand <mask> frustration' which is nice. Separate <mask> raised to <mask> about a <mask> back with <mask> including an <mask> with no <mask> Conclusion is <mask> avoid at <mask> costs."
10.0,"Chicago to London Heathrow. Lovely flight  with a great BA Worldwide Crew,  who are the  best in the  entire fleet. Very  comfortable seat with great extras that  you would expect in 1st Class.  Easy to sleep  as it was  the night flight,  and had a  very full breakfast  for the morning. Baggage allowance was  generous with 3  large 32Kg cases  in 2 cabin  seats Overall, a  great flight, with  the great airline,  which has a  great crew"
9.0,"London Heathrow to Singapore on 28  September 2018. In this review, I am reviewing the a la carte  food option on board for World . World Traveller passengers have the  ability to pre-order  for a selection  from 6 main courses up to 30 days in advance for selected long haul flights  inclusive of LHR with prices ranging from £15 to £18. I had  a Gourmet Dining consisting of braised Hertfordshire beef cheek which was succulent  & delicious. If you do not want to risk not getting your  meal of choice  for a long haul BA flight and if this a la carte  option is available on your route,  I highly recommend  you to go  get it."
1.0,"On to Newark, flight cancelled. This  flight was one  of the worst  we had. The engineers had no  Idea what was wrong with the engine, all air and water shut  off for three hours. Not to  worry the Boeing  747 looked ancient, for a 6  hours flight from Paris I expected  so little more. The flight attendants did not keep  us updated. Lastly  as we got  onto the plane they had one  receptionist at the desk to  help with the  many people who  had to rebook flights and get hotels for the  night Will never  leave British airways  and Delta forever."
1.0,"I flew BA from Heraklion to Gatwick. I bought exit row seats for me and  3 others to  share together with extra leg room. I paid around £150 for that  from January. We  went to the airport 2 hours before departure, queued  to check in and was told  the 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone . I asked why. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She then said we should have  got there earlier. She wouldn't call BA customer service when I showed  her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund  me the seat cost. The flight manager on the  phone told me there was no change of plane. She apologised and  stated she'd take  my case up with BA customer service. I also sent in a  statement Today is 17 days with  NO response and my money still not refunded. I'll never fly with them again. "
2.0,"Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in  but all in all wasn't a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system, food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium Economy. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls  are very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen  looked so small and scratched I doubt I would  have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean  the car with,  just a few words from the  captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was  provided wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew  was very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special,  after having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade. BA this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline, never again."
4.0,"London to London.  This was the  best part of my Sydney to London trip and  looking forward to  flying as it  happened on a BA A380. Now this aircraft, in  different colours, is  one I am  not familiar with  and flown around 30 sectors over  the last 12  years with QF. As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip)  It is the  main board soft  product that is  the problem. The same comments for that review apply : The IFE  remains a work  of mystery in  search of content.  On Qantas, American,  British one gets  a really good  collection of old and new movies, great music choices.  Those who compile the content need  only look at what they mean  by award winning  ( Gladiator, Brave-heart,  Mad Holiday etc)  are all things we as passengers want to see.  Our smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the  show together forgetting that not everyone  was edgy and  loves to see  cutting edge stuff.  That is one  issue on long . The other is food and  entertainment The food  service was just  fantastic and something  I read about constantly. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service,  followed by Weiss  and cream, a  hot chocolate along  each way, midnight snack of a  salad or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs , usual muffin ) At the  back of the main deck is  the snack bar and in the galley will be  some chocolates, banana  and cheese and biscuits. You would  want to be  very hungry to  go through that  menu but the point is that  everything is available and offered. BA need to get away from a meal service on  the off and  on and nothing in between. The  747 is a  great aircraft and  with Qantas it  gets treated as  if I am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time  with their planes. Put the smartest,  best looking crew onto a flagship  aircraft that is  how people will  say The BA crew were of  very certain vintage  and suited to  serving bowls. One  man looked like Steptoe (for those  not remember) and  had a miserable. Flying on an  aircraft should be  great experience and I enjoy all  our trips on  the aircraft. BA have managed to reduce it to  one very large low cost aircraft  for people from  one point to  destination That is  impressive given the stature of BA.  We came back  to BA31 from  London to Hong  Kong and the same comments apply.  Soft product is  similar (except for no snack bar)  as the soft product is lacking <mask>"
4.0,"Sydney to London via Singapore. It has been a very long time  that I was on a long  journey with BA of more than 9 hours. Last year had a  great sprint from London to JFK and before that  since 2002. The  times have not  proven kind to  us Probably a mixture of the decline of BA and the emergence  of other airlines. Nearly all my  recent haul is  with Qantas on its A380, occasionally  Emirates on its version and then once in a  year with Cathay  Airlines and American Airlines. The problem is not the hard product. A B777 or the A380 in whatever  style and decor  I ordered is the same air frame. The B777 from Sydney to Singapore was fine. Nosier than the  others but that 's well known. Very comfortable seats , at 8 hours a relative sprint for those  which call Sydney home. It is the soft product that is lacking.  Checking in was fine and despite  flying in Economy had an express pass through security , a Gold FF with Qantas). Boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into Singapore. Now its just  a lack of polish with the soft product. No  signs given showing  what was to be served (as with Cathay, Emirates and Qantas). The cutlery was really cheap and I mean cheap. KFC  used a better  job of plastic.  You know in  our days of  plastics that proper  quality is not possible but someone at BA needs to check out the plastic used  with Cathay and Qantas). The food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some  sauce that was over salty. Qantas have done away with salads and simply give you  your main dish  with garlic bread and a dessert. It's just the quality that is lacking. Drinks? I have a tradition, something silly, about starting a journey off with a Jack Daniels and  saying This is available on Qantas  but no sir, we don't serve "". A note about the FA's: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product  we are asked  to deliver. Final  word about this  trip is the iFE. A touchscreen but it was  lacking in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. Award winning  and classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 . One or two interesting things , some new releases. Come on BA, for may  hours on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. As for music: well I'm 53 but still like the Pearl Jams etc of the world. We are not <mask> into Brit <mask> and edgy <mask> presenters. If BA is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen <mask> the soft <mask> the food and beverage and <mask> a touch of pizzazz about the airline. It is a mix of BA going back and many others coming up and beyond the <mask> that BA set many years <mask>"
10.0,"Flight to Gatwick operated by Titan Airways. Very full  business class of 36 people. A  single flight attendant , just one  female attendant handled alone. I wish to highly commend  him despite alone  they managed perfectly. "
1.0,"From Barcelona to Gatwick. This review  was about the  queues for check  out rather than  the flight. BA allows you to  book in online,  opting not to  print out a  boarding card. There 's no machine to print a card, queue taking 75 minutes to  collect boarding card, and several people  arriving too late  at check in. There were 4  lines 2 for priority, 2 for  priority check in  on all flights.  Not 1 desk served, once they 're about to close check in"
7.0,"Welcome to London-Heathrow with British Airways.  Although British Airways  was more or  fewer in the  comparable price range  as Lufthansa, no  onboard food or  drink were served.  Everyone was friendly.  And departure was  at Terminal 1 in Munich, which is by far  half as nice  than the newer terminal 2. And arrival at Terminal  4 in Heathrow which is not as nice/easy as  their new Star alliance Queens Terminal 2. No WiFi,  smart device entertainment or onboard monitors  during my flight.  A reservation too expensive in my eyes. British airways  has one big advantage though: the generous hand luggage !"
7.0,"This was an  average morning flight from Heathrow to Keflavik. The flight  was not very full. Shortly after take off, the cabin crew came  out to sell  us snacks and drinks reasonably priced. This was a typical intra-European flight on British Airways where food and drinks are for sale. Cabin crew were efficient. I had the exit  window seat so  leg room was  less than adequate."
3.0,"Cape Town to London. Dated aircraft, very poor cabin  and semi inedible food and the inevitable entertainment system crash made for a very poor  flight The cabin crew clearly regarded us as an  inconvenience and I do not feel that I should  remember having to ask for a  drink with my  first meal, surely we should have been offered something as a matter  of course. I used to be happy to pay more to fly  but now I pay extra not to."
5.0,"Washington to Prague  from London. I have flown them several times in the past, but not for a number of years. I remember them  being not a  fan of the  average airline, but  more than average. This time it seemed that any  extra things have been dropped (hot  seats as you  approach your destination), and they have  been almost a low fare airline. You pay for  airline seats, on  some flights you  pay for food, etc. The seating on the Boeing  777 seemed very . It is  suppose to be  comfortable but seemed like less. On the return flight on May 3rd, two of the  flights went out  for service. The  flights from London  to Prague seemed to have more  leg room, but the seats were very hard. They may be the  new ""slimline"" seats,  but not sure,  because they were  very uncomfortable even  after a two hour flight. Also, on the Washington  to LHR flight we had  print out boarding passes at home.  Our agent at Washington printed out  extra ones and said we should  use them, but  when we got  to security she  only printed out two for me and none for my wife. It was lucky we  still had the  ones we printed out at home.  I won't say that I will not fly them , but I will definitely compare prices in the future. They aren't worth any extra ."
3.0,"Welcome to Washington.  Nothing from the  start nothing nothing  from First class, not even the  Cabin Crew was  even more attentive  to service than  our coach. Food which used to be fantastic is  barely eatable, no  more Wines which were the best in the sky when Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson  did the selection : from a  fine white champagne,  another mediocre rosé)  are at the level of a business class. And  the seat did not have sound from the audio/video system: so they moved me. And  half hour later  their whole system  died without the  coach apologizing. Needless to say no  more Apart from  their LHR First and Concorde Room  facilities at LHR which remain great, BA is now  little better than  the 3 star ? Sad for  my clients and  good for BA ."
8.0,"I had called the British Airways  passenger service staff to ask about  a plane change at London Heathrow from Washington Dulles  into Glasgow. I was told that  British border control  should be done  with final destination  was Glasgow, but  it was not ! Passengers arriving  to London Heathrow from international and connecting to domestic flights have to  pass UK border control, long lines  and then security screen again,   without gaining access  to flights. Even  with mobility assistance and a fast  boarding card and  20 minutes between  flights it was a close call to make connections."
1.0,"Back to Montreal. I did my online check-in the night before and left to go  to the airport. I arrived at  Montreal airport 2.5 hours in advance, went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass, and the kiosk wasn't working, so I proceeded to  the BA counter to get my pass and check in my luggage. I was in line for approximately 15 minutes when we were all told to switch . The line  they were moved to was substantially  longer however I was patient. By the time I got to the  gate an hour  had passed, and I had a bit over an  hour left to my flight. I  knew this was tight but all the while manageable  that I trusted BA's system. The  person at the  gate asked me where I was  from and when I said Montreal, she looked at  it and said ""you won't make ."" I explained the situation how I had been  at the airport for several hours  already and that I was in  Canada for 1 %. She just told me I needed to go to the missed flight counter. I got to the counter and they informed me that  I had to buy a new  plane ticket. My original return ticket cost me $800,  my return cost  was $1350.  I had no  option but to buy the ticket. I also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to Gatwick airport the following morning. Once I arrived back in  London I called  the Customer Services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket, and that I could get a refund, if not for the new flight, then for  the $400 of the flight I missed. Imagine my shock after spending an additional $1500  more all in. When I escalated  the complaint, they did not address  my case for over a month  and once they did they just said we cannot refund you, and that was that. "
5.0,"Tokyo to Amsterdam via London. On the evening before departure I received an email from  them the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldn't be a delay. In the end the aircraft left Tokyo Haneda with a 90 minutes delay. Baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with Japanese politeness. If you have the choice to fly from NRT or HND I would definitely choose HND because it's much more conveniently located to downtown Tokyo. The aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft, adding more time to the delay we already had. I didn't like the seats on the 777. I found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient, especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you. On the window and aisle seats, there's also the IFE box so there's no place for both feet. The meal was a joke and there was no choise. Inflight entertainment is not up to date,  only screens with  poor brightness. The crew was not very friendly. When I went to the galley for a drink I was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs. The second meal service was rushed. We've got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to LHR.  Luckily I've made  through to my connecting flight to Amsterdam because I had a short connection. The A320 flight to Amsterdam departed ahead of schedule. There's nothing special to write about this short flight although one round of drinks would have been nice. Unfortunately BA decided to cut the the service on European flights in the race to the bottom."
5.0,Getting at Vienna Airport was painless.  I uses Air Lounge at Vienna  and was adequate  and enough seating  but food was okay. Boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to  Eastern Europe passengers. The flight wasn’t full therefore service  was quite prompt. I found the  passengers to be quite engaging and friendly and were  pleasant to talk to. The food  seemed quite mediocre  which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwiches.  A passenger wasn’t  very happy with the serving and  the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was. Business  class was quite  nice to be  on Will fly  to Europe again  later depending on which route and  how BA has a lot of  catch up to  to compare to other carrier within Europe.
2.0,"Had a day trip to Vienna with British Airways,  arranged at the  last minute. Flying out at 0720 , a Sunday and having an  early start to  getting to the airport I was  quite forward to  getting some sleep on the flight. Having never usually  had a problem, I boarded the  aircraft and asked  how it would  be possible to  get a pillow and blanket, to  be told by  the member of  staff that these are not for  leisure passengers –  only business. Freezing temperature onboard the  flight so managed to get limited sleep – another  example of BA’s pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates  complete non-existence of  proper service within the airline. Despite  this being one of the first flights out of  Vienna with no  delay for departure  and perfect weather  forecast – we  only managed to arrive about 20  minutes late into  Austria – quite as to how,  remains beyond me.  Will be sticking to easyJet until British Airways once  more starts to  treat it’s passengers, as currently they couldn’t care less."
1.0,"Welcome to Heathrow. BA are a  joke it once stood for a  double standard and  kept the flag high. My flight  from Islay was  delayed by 2  hours no fault  not mine, so  had missed my  next flight! After  I fobbed off , not my  choice nothing we  could do I  started phoning and  after an hour  after being passed  round pillar to  pillar and back  again I had  them pay for  another flight. Money  sucking company with  terrible customer service  and lack of  good feeling"
7.0,"Back to Phoenix  last week. Having  a window seat  at the top  is your kind of rest assured  you will have privacy and rest. This was successful  on the flight with 6 hours slept which was  very comfortable which I was surprised at. The meals were good and tasty with the service pleasant enough for BA. The poorest part of  the trip is the TV being so small and picture so poor.  In the end,  could really use  that as it was so frustrating amongst other operational  issues i.e. press pause and film would start from  nothing Would I  fly again, sure why not."
1.0,"Glasgow to Heathrow. Very disappointed in British Airways. Having been delayed by a ""partner airline"" and therefore missed the last connecting flight of the  evening BA charged  me and my friend full price to rebook for the morning. Their system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my BA exec club membership so I'd had to book it as two flights. Neither BA or Loganair would take responsibility  for us stranded at the airport for the night. Clearly, being a member of the BA exec club counts for nothing. Very bad customer  behaviour BA. Seems BA and Loganair are only in partnership to extort more money from your passengers."
9.0,"Brussels to Shanghai  from London Heathrow.  Great flights on  a clean aircraft,  weather good, cabin  staff friendly.   Highly recommend British Airways. The only complaint I have is about the  airport staff at . I lost  my jacket on  my Shanghai to London flight and  some staff at  JFK gave the  email address of a company for  found objects."
8.0,"Chicago to London Heathrow. I was dubious about flying  again especially after my last flight over a year  ago - after  that I left the aircraft feeling  quite hungry. However  my trip to  London with BA was surprisingly very  comfortable both ways. On this flight, after deciding not  to spend on an upgrade, I  felt pleasantly surprised  at being given a seat with  more leg room - didn't feel  the need to get up and  move my legs once. Although I slept a lot  on the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to  change the direction of Mecca so  I could pray (in my seat).  Also given two  bites of pretzels  or two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss.  BA is a  very nice aircraft and the take off and landing  were excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise  emanating form the galley noise of the journey. For  breakfast there was  roast chicken, rice , lentils, and  a rice pudding  for desert, all of which was okay - nothing ."
5.0,"London to Philadelphia  via London. I  paid BA because the fare was  outrageous which explains  why on a  3 hour 40 minute flight ATH  and LHR they  do not serve  snacks and beverages free. On the aircraft having paid  at our chosen  flight there was  NO waste envelope,  but my inflight magazine was so  on LHR to  be an immaculate aircraft smooth flight  all the way, rather poor lunch. I was disappointed  by BA especially with their decision to charge for  food on European  routes"
5.0,"Hong Kong to  BA Heathrow on  arrival in Club World. This was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to HK on an  island on Cathay  Pacific and the  airport was huge. The BA Club World cabin is  quite cramped when  combined with Cathay. The seat configuration  is ok if  your want to  tend to your  family or friend  but there is  so little room  and store items  which just feels  very cramped. The  sheets and blankets come in a bag that is  under the seat , which the crew insist on  storing in the overhead lockers for  take off, this  will fare enough  but there is  no room. They also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage ! The food  choice was also  quite the duck ling as my  main course was very tough. Drinks selection was very good. Plus points  goes to the  catering crew, who  are very professional  and had a sense of humour.  The BA plan  to change the  business class seating in 2019 and  this cannot come  close enough."
8.0,"Los Angeles to London Heathrow return.  BA Outbound First Class, return Club World. A380 both sectors, awesome aircraft. Firstly, BA flight deck crews are  all Totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots.   All cabin crew on both sectors were polite, friendly  & professional. Their service was excellent.  It wasn’t feeling  good on the out bound flight  and I didn’t eat anything, so  i can’t comment  upon the food. On the return flight, in Club  world the food was very good, no complaints there. The seats were comfortable although the Club World cabin felt cramped. I  was in 53K which is a  standard rear facing bulk head seat. As it was a daytime flight,  no noise coming  from the galley  did bother me, but I think it would be an issue on night flights. I hope BA change their business class seating for something like AA business class on their . BA business  Class is really dated, and I  thought it felt cramped. My BIG  problem and this  is entirely BA’s fault was the over zealous security screening at Heathrow.  Everyone was pulled  aside for screening 3 times. I don’t mind extensive, in depth security  and to be  checked 3 times  seems excessive. I  am enrolled in  a pay for  the Pre Check and if British  Airlines would participate in this program, it would save a lot of  time Other than , the overall  security experience was  completely acceptable."
3.0,"Hamburg to Abu Dhabi via London. Hamburg to Heathrow not even a  small glass of water or a candy. Everything is for purchase, I felt cheated. Heathrow Terminal 5 was a big mass. Getting from my arrival gate to the departure gate  took me over  twice within the same terminal! Security screening was extremely slow and staff rude. I will avoid Heathrow in the future. Long flight to Abu  Dhabi was ok, no frills in Premium Economy but edible food. Return  flight was similar,  with Heathrow terminal 5 less chaotic this time. My last flight on BA was over 30 years ago, it was a real premium carrier then. "
7.0,"Overnight club world flight from Rio  via London. Check in at Rio  was efficient. Third  floor lounge (Premium plaza) which was  spacious and had  ample space. No fast track security lanes in Rio. Plane ready near enough on time with well organized boarding. On board,  to club world ! My feeling  is that the food and beverage  selection is not  very good as  is used to ? Granted they only loaded one  in the wine options (which was wasn't great either). Food itself not terribly appetizing. Breakfast quite rushed, which it did not need to be given the long  duration of the flight. Flight landed on time, priority bags worked and were off quickly. An average experience. However, BA were not the lowest cost option on this route (at the time of  booking that was Air France- a carrier I rate ), but they  had a direct  route"
2.0,"From Heathrow to  Amsterdam The 747  flying this route , an old  burnt out aircraft,  so though I  went for premium economy the seat  was hard, small  but uncomfortable, it  would not recline  in the air  without yanking the  seat back, the  right foot rest was broken on  one side so  even during the  entire flight my  leg was tilted  or slid off.  My touch on  my back of the screen was  really difficult to  reach and barely  comfortable The washroom had a leak , when I used it in  the middle of  a flight water  started running along  my floor and  soaking my socks,  an air stewardess  only gave a  nervous laugh and said I shouldn’t  had worn socks. There was no  back pack of  sun shades etc,  and of two  colour choices one had run out , two rows  having been served.  My  crew  were bored and  not bothered."
8.0,"Madrid to London. Credit where it's due. Flew club  members and the crew were excellent. Friendly, attentive and  attentive The food  was a good standard. The B767  had a dedicated business class cabin  and larger seats. Think they will be phased out this year but a good example  of good service."
2.0,"Venice to Gatwick.  I use Snokart  baggage which is  supposed to be  folded and fastened  separately to allow skiers to check  into one bag ! In Feb of this year,  i was told  by BA check  out staff in  Nottingham that it is against their  baggage policy to allow luggage to be fastened together. The staff were clear that it  was BA policy  so bags cannot  been fastened together. For nearly three  months I have  been asking the  BA complaints team  for provide evidence  of this baggage policy. I have  got several replies in that time but on each  one the customer  service staff have  refused to provide  evidence of the  same policy alleged  against their check  out staff in  London BA has also refused to  say whether these  customer check in  employees are in  reality BA employees or employed by  some third party.  This is very  wrong in what  was a reputable  business"
3.0,"First 3 legs were trouble free. Lounges were good,  security staff were good, some were  very poor, especially the agent I encountered at security in LHR. My flight from Singapore  became delayed in the air and I was not allowed onto my connecting flight. British Airways re-booked me  for the next  leg but downgraded  me from Business to Economy and into a centre seat. Fine, I  had to get home and they said they would  help me. After 3 weeks, they  were mailed back to say they  will refund the  money to my company who paid the ticket, but I was not entitled to any  such token gesture of Frequent Flyer  support for the  sake of being  bumped and put  in an aisle seat, after a long haul flight.  I missed out on a meal and the option  to be comfortable  or to try and catch up  some further sleep.  This was all  done very poorly, late and without regard to a frequent flyer who  had the option  of fly via Air France or one of the middle east carriers  that value my . Its left me with a  rather sour taste in my mouth and I will certainly look at  flights with other carriers now."
2.0,"South London to  Paris with British  Airlines Massively overpriced  flights to other  carriers on this route like Ryanair or Easyjet with no real added value. No drinks or food served on the flight, the check-in process is just as painful and most  of the time  will force you to ckeck in your hand baggage as well. A  little more legroom  and that won’t  make the £200 % difference on  the 2hr flight."
1.0,Sat for a Vueling Airlines flight  connecting Florence to  Birmingham and bumped off flight. When  called British airways  became unhelpful and told the flight had nothing to do with them  - though I bought the ticket from ba.com and had one flight number BA2058. A shocking attitude towards  a paying customer.
8.0,"Welcome to Sao  Tome Overnight club  and flight. Prompt  checking in at  gate and into . No spaces at the spa, Galleries lounges were fine and showers clean. Good WiFi.  Lounge was a  breeze so in  flight entertainment was  free They also  had WiFi on , Crew experienced  employees were good. Service prompt, food  good and I liked the new  Fast Company offerings.  I arrived early.  Was a solid  flight"
1.0,"Worst BA flight ever! Flew Tampa to London Gatwick. No greeting by the door, shown to economy despite  empty seat. Dirty plane. Bits dangling from the ceiling. Only once all passengers were seated delay was announced and refuelling commenced, which is a clear indication that  it was known earlier. Probably the worst business class seat around, wobbly footrest, facing strangers  or having to climb over people. Breakfast was a  rather meagre roll  with one tiny  orange slice and unbranded ketchup. At disembarkation the crew did help elderly passengers, that was left to other  airlines Crew just  stood there. Economy was not held back, so no priority disembarkation. Never again."
1.0,"Flying British Airways  from London Heathrow  to Dusseldorf. Despite being row 1,  it was tiny.  A comparison to  the Eurowings, which  are a budget ? Food terrible.  Much worse was  your seat. This  was not business  that one expects  this degree of  discomfort Next time  you will fly  in and get  extra leg room,  with a table  I can actually  sleep on."
3.0,"Return to London. The main plus  about this flight  is the cabin crew who were professional and friendly, and hard working. The I saw no food in the Iberia lounge at Madrid, no working washrooms, and  poor Iberia staff. The food on board was ludicrous, in business I  tried a panini - the staff looked embarrassed to serve it. Waste er money. "
1.0,"London to Moscow. British Airways has downgraded their plane to a smaller plane and hence seat in Business class is no  more Club World (flat bed) seat but Club Europe seat (not flat bed). It is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable. I cannot fly during the day as I have meetings  and BA has not offered a like for like change, they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day. Moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that BA is offering during the day. They also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date, like Friday when the seat (whether club world or club Europe) is less important as Saturday not a working day and one can get  a rest. In Summary it is  unfair that BA is charging more for the flights with Club World Seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without  offering a like for like change. This was never the case before and BA was fair previously."
9.0,"Miami to London. My most recent BA experience was positive. I fly BA for work and leisure up to 4 long  leg flights a  month On my  most recent flight  from Miami to LHR I found the whole economy experience well above average, despite the  small aircraft the  BA Which to  me is the legend of the skies! The cabin crew in economy were smart, attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty  to an elite service, from the MIA ground handling  cabin crew. Food  and beverage service  very good, seating in my aisle  seat 29E generous for my long legs. I recently  flew BA business/ Club world to the Far East for work and despite the unlimited  amenities and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of  a flight. Well done BA you  compete against the North American carriers on routes to the North American gateways who give just a basic service."
4.0,"Gatwick to Barbados , December 2017.  For a 9  hour flight they provided one meal,  an afternoon tea  and consisted of  the mars bar and a cup of tea. The plane was aging and yellowing round the edges and the staff were  tired The only  nice thing was , it was  cheaper than competitors (but still not cheap)."
4.0,"from Heathrow to Dallas. The aircraft was old no  need of refurbishment for the last  5 years or so. Seat pocket was full of  baggage from previous flight. The personal  screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a  touch screen, so I had to  use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable. The choice of IFE is very limited. The food on both outbound and inbound  planes were mediocre and with small  meals I saw  several passengers request  some more food,  so I was glad to see  cabin crew giving out nicely without attitude. I must admit that the  crews on the  departures were exceptional,  and the inbound  were acceptable but still better than most crew on  the to/from JFK. I had an onward connecting flight with American Airlines, and I can  definitely see the changes between the  three airlines over the past few  years Whilst AA  keeps improving, BA  are becoming a national embarrassment. BA remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes  to seat selection. The seat selection  percentage tag just  above the total  fares higher than other decent airlines. It no longer deserves a 4-star  review but edging between 2 or 3 star. It's not even worth redeeming Avios points anymore. These days , rather spend my Avios on  cheaper airlines."
3.0,"Decided to go in Club Europe for this relatively  long flight (90 minutes) from London to Copenhagen. Dropped my bags and went through security, which did not take too long. I then went to the Galleries Lounge (south), and although I have not been there for a year or two, it  felt the same. Same food, same drinks, same slow wifi. My gate was just around the corner, and I got on the plane. I like the fresh look inside, but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business. The food service was disappointing. The service in  my cabin was OK, but not very warm. I have travelled a lot with BA over the past 20 years, after  that I have lost my faith in British Airways."
2.0,"BA used to  hold a byword  in quality and service. You simply  cant say that anymore and the only thing that  seemed to have  stayed the same  was the ticket price. I paid  200 dollars for my ticket from  Istanbul to London with BA. For that price there  is no airbridge (you will wait  for a crowded bus) and no entertainment (note: this is a 4 am flight. Also,  any devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight, so no alternative of  streaming movies on your iPad). Oh and you’ll have to buy any food and drinks on board. I flew BA on this route because no other flight time worked for  us however Turkish Airlines is by  FAR the better  airline with airbridge,  free hot meals and a modern entertainment system. Pegasus and AtlasGlobal offer a similar service to BA but  costs far lower  prices It seems to be the  case all over. BA used to  remain a first choice but at  the price, for this service, it’s  becoming a last  resort"
1.0,"British economy worse than most airlines economy. Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food,  extremely poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally, we  had a family  with 4 travelling together but split  flights and 3 of us were seated between two  of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside  of toilet doors which meant an  uncomfortable night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos.  Many airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with  smoke - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they  walked in to blow their nose  and check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the  extremely long and  boring flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!”  He laughed about it with the  man next to him. In my  opinion better (and cheaper) premium economy  to be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge. I’ve never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with British Airways, I’ve never had a good experience."
1.0,"Flew Belfast to  London with British Airways. Stressful day started with a 2.5 hours delay for the morning flight at 7am. As an apology, they sold us  our food and the drinks, yes  even asked for money, even though we were stuck on the airplane for over three hours! Seriously, if  you can find  any alternative to travel within the UK do it.  Not very countable  if you have  another connected flight!"
4.0,Naples to Gatwick.  BA online check-in  would not work  on me in accordance with the  new World Frequent  Fly policy. I  am a Qantas  frequent flyer and  thought I ought to have had  a chance to  book a few days ahead of the flight. The  BA website would not let me  do so. The bag-drop in Naples was slow and seemed rather random. Boarding was tedious.  We should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. In  that mean time other passengers were allowed through the  boarding gate which proved to be  closed as a  shuttle bus was . Boarding was chaotic and passengers  had far too much hand luggage. The cabin crew  were quite indifferent. I greeted 2 cabin crew when I boarded and neither of them  waved back. I bought a Marks and Spencer drink at an inflated  rate One of the crew moved  a small bag in the overhead  compartment and at the end of the flight when I went to collect my bag it has been  replaced by the  hand of another passenger. Disembarkation was  chaotic and badly managed. Nobody from  cabin crew fare  paid the passengers. BA has become a low-cost airline in its service and given the  quality of the  staff and the charge for a bag I will not be using them again in  any hurry.
5.0,"I have been flying with BA for the last 32 years between Sao Paulo and London on and off but mostly BA. I have travelled in all classes except First. BA used to  be a very good airline and stand out from  competitors but now  BA look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Not  value for money.  The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for  another drink, even in Business (I  opted out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on  board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude,  no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats  of the 777-300  very hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food  being really bad and of poor quality. It is  really shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from  The UK as they definitely offer top quality service  especially on their business class. BA  has become mean,  rude and indifferent  to their customers  and I feel it is time for the CEO  must go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg.  Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at  least and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled.  So I had  a reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to  the small luggage to make it  14 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So  we will in future re-think my  flights to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service,  good for money and a differentiated ? Thumbs down , BA."
1.0,"I traveled on  British Airways with my wife from Dallas to Lagos,  Nigeria via London on February 23,  2017 I had an extra bag  which I paid  dearly for in  advance our flight  is delayed in Dallas, therefore we missed our flight to Lagos. When  we got to  Dallas we went  to the BA counter to explain our situation and find a solution  but they decided  and put us  onto a Virgin  Atlantic flight to . On getting to Virgin Atlantic counter, we were told that we  had to pay  for the bag  again and request for a refund from BA, we  decided to do  that I opened a case on  BA website, explaining what happened and requested for a refund, as what happened was their  problem and not . They refused  to issue the  refund claiming that  our airline has their own baggage ! I know  this but what happened was not  our fault, but .. That was  that last time I heard from  BA on the  airline even the economy premium was  the waste of  time nothing special, such a disappointment,  yet again!"
1.0,"Flew British Airways from Budapest to London Heathrow. Quite possibly the worst flight I have ever had (and I travel often). Generally when we travel, we try to pack our  checked baggage light, as we check our heavier bags  so it's more convenient for other passengers too. My partner and I  have 2 briefcase-sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker. As more passengers boarded, most with as-large-as-possible carryons, the overhead lockers filled up. The  flight attendant walks  up to the overhead locker above our heads, takes out our bags, hands them to  her and says ""I'm sorry but the space is needed for large bags"", telling us  they put them underneath the seat in front of us. Reducing our leg room to zero. How is this at all ?! I questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry-ons, and was given the  warning that I  could delay the  plane if the bags had to  get offloaded. I have no idea who at BA thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean ""thank you for bringing smaller carry-ons  like everyone else, as a measure of our appreciation, we'll take away  some leg room"".  The general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention. Young adults barely out of high school, and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services Starbucks, such was their experience  in providing pleasant . What a sad state of affairs. I will never ever travel British Airways willingly again, long haul or short haul. I would rather take a civilised one-stop journey with  ease and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the  constant dirty feeling of a direct British Airways flight."
4.0,"The air conditioning didn’t work in  one part of  the airplane where we were sitting and it was very hot. I had to stand in the back of the airplane where it was  cold It was  an 8 hours  flight from London Heathrow to New York JFK. Overall  The airplane was  small with little space to seat. There was no . The leg/seating space was very  tight I wish  the food would  be more taste neutral. If your child doesn’t like spicy or flavored foods/snacks, there would  been nothing to eat. The stewardesses  were most helpful and their service  was outstanding. Landing  was smooth. The BA staff made us to check in our bags  while they were  loaded on. There are measuring boxes where you should be able to stick your luggage in, and these boxes are very small. Also the Airport Security was overly zealous -  we had to search kids bag, and they found roll-on deodorant and checked it for fumes. "
1.0,"My bag was damaged on a  domestic flight in December 2017. All  looked good when  i got to  an airport customer services counter - was told it  could be replaced and they gave  you a number  they call. I  call this number  back home and it's a 3rd  party company called . They will  not replace with a poor quality  one that is  basically the same  of the one  that damaged despite  its being in  poor condition and hardly used. I  tried this with  BA who refused  the offer like-for-like  and I got  through with them  spending hours on hold numerous times. 4 months later , decide that  anything is better than nothing and call K2, to  cancel the bag  being offered me,  only to find  out BA have  rejected my case  that they won't  have one. Finally  get through to  someone and they  finally agree to put me back  on K2 to  get the bag . If I want to upgrade  as they offer I will have  TO pay it . I wont hold my breath  until it is  scheduled to arrive  by Tuesday. I  will not fly  back unless I  see no other  viable option."
10.0,"Efficient check in  with staff advised on best lounge  options for our  needs Decided to opt for premium  lounge as only  2 hour flight  from London Heathrow  from Cairo. Galleries  of lounge was  a quiet good  variety of snacks  including an afternoon tea offering which  is quite good. Showers clean and  well presented. Chaotic boarding. Well presented aircraft, staff in  first economy cabin offered welcome drink. Slightly delayed departure  was made up en route. Unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was  quite acceptable. Efficient  flight and good  live entertainment. Happy  with whole experience.  Personally don’t think  we would use  this club world  on a long  flight but for  long flight where  I don’t need  much sleep it  is fine."
2.0,"Flying Lucia to Gatwick. As this  is a night  trip we decided  the fly business  as we might get some sleep and I now  wish we'd saved  that extra that it cost, a  total waste of money. The cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn't clean (half  eaten biscuit down the side of my seat and  two bags on the floor) and the service and food were average at best. Why in this day  & age do BA persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? Not that I could get  close enough to sleep anyway, the seat was adequate and no more,  my entertainment system  however was small and the touch  screen was very  poor needing very  minimal contact to  make any response. On top of  which there was no USB point  that charge my  phone I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea  or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of  paying for anything that was needed rather than being offered it -  I certainly don't expect to have  someone remind the flight attendant about the cup of  tea requested 15 minutes earlier. All  and all it was an education,  it taught me  my lesson!"
6.0,"From Lauderdale to Gatwick. An efficient courtesy bus took  us from car rentals (terminal 1)  into the international terminal (terminal 4).  Everyone was friendly.  The staff insisted  upon using a whole-body scanner for everyone and were overly officious. Surprisingly,  it was no  business class lounge, although there was plenty of sitting space before the  flight in the redeveloped terminal. Boarding  was according to  price rather than priority which caused  much annoyance. Club  seating was in two smaller cabins,  with the usual, outdated eight seats abreast. Take-off was on time. The wrong menus had been loaded, so  an actual menu was announced over the tannoy. Drinks , food service  worked efficiently. Food adequate and not overcooked, but below  the standard of  United Airlines. Seats  uncomfortable and uncomfortable  when sleeping, with the usual issue of having to climb over legs  whilst in a  window seat. Abbreviated  food (no hot option) served an hour before landing. Arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule.  Was an adequate flight, but the  passenger experience was well below BA's  standard"
7.0,"London to London . It's bad that BA requests  for payment to  book seats before  you check-in. If  travelling solo it's  not a big  deal but with any companion (in this case I  went with my  group of 10)  that would have  caused an issue  and be separate.  It also means  that if there  was 3 or  more flights, and  no group of  10 (as in  our case) the difference would be  well up to  about 1000$. Lucky enough at least  for the return  trip we were able to select  the middle seats because the flight  is full. On  board service was  excellent Professional, courteous  & friendly attendants. Toilets in the second half of  my flight weren't  always clean. Flat  seats in business class are outdated  yet comfortable for  a nice sleep.  Our aircraft did  indeed have WiFi."
2.0,"London to Las Vegas. Disappointed at  BA - flights were delayed (my partner took the same outbound flight  for a different day and was delayed as well by 2-3hrs). Aircraft interior was outdated, unclean and uncomfortable seats with very  limited legroom space. No safety video which was surprising as most long haul flights include this. Food was tasteless and I did skip a meal in the end - during  one of the  meal times we weren't given the options by our FA but the  man sat next to us who was served by another FA was given different options. Inflight entertainment poor with very limited  seats and monitors were very old.  To ensure that  we sit with  my partner on the return flight,  both paid to reserve our seats - not impressed by this especially when we realised  all the legroom  space for my partner was obstructed by a broke IFE box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down would affect his monitor.  Learnt our lessons, next time we will not fly BA!"
10.0,"Tampa to Gatwick.  I am a  British traveller with  significant mobility issues.  Because I usually travel alone I  often find it extremely difficult. However, from the moment I arrived at  a check in  counter in Tampa I was met with the utmost courtesy and assistance.  With the check in clerk at  first class waving  you forward to  enter his terminal  it just went  from excellent to exceptional. I was helped to put my suitcase onto the conveyor scale and assisted with  any step of  every way until the aircraft door.  Each person was polite, helpful and went out of  their way to  make my journey as pleasant as possible. I witnessed  such kindness and  that is what  we have come  to expect and value from British  Airlines Having used other airlines in the past - I am converted  and I will  definitely use any other airline in  2017"
7.0,"Heathrow to Keflavik. I had booked economy, was pleasantly surprised to be  accepted when I  logged in online.  Priority boarding worked well and even though the flight was full there was no  baggage locker range.  The inflight meal was prawns was generous along with  very good selection of wine. Off loading was straightforward. The return flight was on time, the pre booked  business seat had more leg room the premium seat.  Overall food service  is OK. The  cabin crews were  great at taking payment. Overall similar experience to an easyjet flight."
7.0,"Welcome to Muscat  first class. First  day trying out  second class on  arrival Check-in was fairly quick and  I didn't have  any luggage, but  my first wing did not feel  particularly exclusive. I  also selected window seat in advance and this was  easy and still  working as I  was printed boarding ! Concorde room was nice, well  appointed but quite  crowded in some  places Had to ask for a  drink two times out in the  lobby before it  finally served a good 20 minutes , Checkout out the cabana for an hour, which  was not very appealing at all, and managed to  book the first  5 min of the 15min treatment  package booked for  The Spa. Onboard  I informed there  is a problem with the Seat  we had selected,  and was issued  a new aisle , which was disappointing. Upon entering the first class  cabin I had  a quick look at the seat,  but it was  almost immediately apparent,  this was something  that I asked  flight crew to  investigate and they  came back to  me that I will indeed not  be able to sit there, but  that was no  explanation of what was wrong given.  We did not  need to waste any time to settle in, the  guy looking after  us introduced himself  and served me  hot and warm  food as well  to offering some magazines to read. Seat was comfortable and spacious enough  but seemed fairly private, with a  matching wardrobe to  the jacket. The  tv screen seemed  quite large and  good quality. Unfortunately , seat controls were not super responsive, and neither  was the remote for the TV.  Immediately after take  out I was  glad I could eat when I  ordered Arabic starter , great. Had  my main meal , Meal was  also good quality , cooked well.  Got a dessert , the mixed cheese plate (not  as good as  mixed cheese I've  seen in some  business class). Surprisingly , entertainment system had a rather  limited selection, I 'm on two  other flights in  this same month,  I might run  short of anything of interest to . After finishing  the one film  I decided to  watch I decided to try get  some sleep. Crew made the bedding , I tried  a put on  the pyjamas in  my tiny first  Class bathroom. Bedding  is of good  quality and comfortable  but I missed  eating as I  was still rather  exhausted from the  meal and pre-dinner  in the lounge. Overall, I was reasonably happy with  this flight and  the product. The crew were very  friendly and professional.  As this was  economy class, have  gotta admit there  was no wow  there either with  this soft product  and ground experience.  I managed to  book flights for  a good price  and a promo, otherwise it would <mask> not be <mask> the price <mask> for a <mask> short flight."
1.0,"My family and I travelled from Cape Town to London on the  25 March 2018.  I have a  one year old and a 4  week old. Once seated, we realised that our entertainment system was not working. The cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either.  It was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this. As it was a night flight, my wife and I had to see to our 1 year old in the dark. Any help we needed required us to walk  to the galley to receive any assistance. As BAs safety demonstration prior to take off  was on video, we didn't receive  assistance The flight was the worst airline experience we've had. I doubt  we ever fly with BA again."
4.0,"Gatwick to Madeira.  My flight left on time and arrived early, slept  in early morning . The plane  is not very clean, grubby tray  of seats and  dried dirt in the spokes of the seats. The staff were pleasant.  Nothing was offered  for my children  and it was  free The return  is poorly organised, no use of fast track security  or business class passengers. Long queue for boarding and a grubby plane.  Absolutely no point in paying for business class. The staff try so  damn hard to please the passengers  after nearly 4  years and no entertainment, dog-eared magazines.  Quickly disembarked , swiftly through  security"
2.0,"Back to Casablanca. Their customer service quality in Heathrow Terminal 3 is very patchy. For background, my initial flight was with TAP Portugal which got cancelled, then  switched to BA. My second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting TAP to  replace me, BA  chose the liberty of rebooking a  third flight for  BA - which  turned out to be overbooked. This  situation caused me  having to liaise  between both TAP and BA to  get my 4th flight - I was tossed around  with both customer  services telling me  was not their problem. TAP can  now longer rebook me on another  plane as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as BA  gets me on the 3rd flight. I was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to  any rebooking issue - the last  flight I was rebooked was overbooked. However, later on I was passed on to a couple of rude  staff that were reluctant to serve  passengers as it was 15 minutes  before their end of shift. They were also talking about me in  terms of me and accused me of taking advantage of BA. This  was very rude and extremely unprofessional. I've never had  such treatment during  over 10+ years of flying with various airlines, both top rated and  high cost carrier."
8.0,"British Airways flight  delays is very  important I travelled on BA985 from  Germany to Hong Kong via London , 19 Feb.  Due to the  cold weather, my  journey leaving Berlin to London was delayed, in which I was worried about missing my connecting flight from  Berlin to Hong . During the  delay the manager came to me several times, explained to me the  reasons of flight delay, informed me about the connecting  ticket arrangements. Her information was very  well trusted she has been working  together with airport  staff on this.  Very much appreciated for their service."
2.0,London to Brussels via London. Didn't  want this from  European Airways. For  me quality hit  the rock bottom.  With the unclean  service I would 've preferred the  route from Brussels to London and  Vice versa for  my long haul travel. Maybe my expectations was too  low but considering the price I  paid for ticket  i think it's  well worth it.  Another airline which  we used to  use had the  lowest price and  as I compare the services of  the ariline I  am choosing British  Airways
7.0,"London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale is  part of BA's  flagship long-haul routes and clearly designed  to cater for  summer sun seekers.  In September 2018, the Gatwick fleet will be 'densified', with an horrific  route across in bound and a reduced Club World. The 777-200 on our flight was of the bog-standard  Boeing vintage, which  meant 48 pax els into the Club World cabin , everyone having  the make do with the ancient,  small screen, low  resolution IFE that  prevents the usual rebooting. But there  are positive aspects  to the flight:  a young and efficient cabin crew,  vastly improved Club  World food service , plates brought  right to one's  destination and arrival ahead of schedule, although this was  weighed down by the delayed disembarkation that's commonplace at  Port Lauderdale terminal 4. Overall, an  extremely reasonable flight."
3.0,Milan to London Heathrow. The service and cleanliness has hit rock bottom at BA I  was flying with them very frequently and this last  trip was testament that they have  such passion. The response was we  are not responsible for cleaning the  airport
10.0,"London to Helsinki, Business class, Friday 23rd March. I  felt service in  the sky had died out. As a frequent flyer I haven’t felt  I needed to complain nor commend  anyone now. I  wanted to say something, to say thank you for one of the most pleasurable flights I have ever had. This is old school airline service, puts the glamour and luxury  straight into air travel. Cabin staff made me feel like I was  they only person  they were serving. I loved the  atmosphere the way  people made it  very personal and  the fact they took such great  notice of my daughter who is  as fussy as  it comes. "
10.0,"From Heathrow to  London Words cannot express my gratitude  or appreciation for the lovely crew that worked so hard to make  sure I was comfortable on my  last flight; but  there it goes!  He was very sick/nauseas from food  poisoning on a different airline and the staff off British Airways literally  got me back  to health. They  looked beyond wonderful , were genuinely caring and concerned.  I never once felt like a  passenger even though  you were checking on me often!  Business class crew!!  Always so thankful for people like this, especially in my time of need and would  absolutely recommend this  airline to everyone."
3.0,"It was a 13 hours flight from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur with British Airways, and it was my first long haul flight with absolutely no meals served. During the dinner, I was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying ! For the breakfast, the flight was 20 minutes ahead of schedule so they were in a rush serving the meals (up until 40 minutes before landing, they were still serving), I waited for my turn but no food came so I asked. Instead of them explaining and apologising, I had to ask where is my food. They said that  the ran out of food, because they only cater for 80% of the passengers assuming some will be asleep. The cabin crew were very nice, he apologised and passed me a feedback form which I have filled in. While I understand that this airline does not want to waste food (and I liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in !), it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hours. Also, it was also my first time seeing the cabin luggage space  being occupied by the luggage of  other cabin crew (I thought they should have their own?). It was  also my first time waiting at the toilet for at least 10 minutes, and out it came a cabin crew. Very interesting experience."
1.0,"The business class I flew, you are facing a stranger for the  entire flight. Also  every time the  staff have to  let a passenger  up to me, i have to stop eating and  he has to  be in front of my face. Dreadful food, a  very dated 777 plane and   horrible staff. The  staff on board  are supposed to  be full range  of mid flight snack and sandwiches , apparently they  were out and  the reason from  airline crew said  you are taking  to much food. They also ran  all of the  snacks I was  really sorry, we  are out of satay, and other  airlines have already  replaced them. Therefore,  i select another option. "
7.0,"Beijing to London. Service at the British Airways business class counter at Beijing airport was pleasant. The business lounge was quiet when we were there, however, food options were very limited, we were  flying in the morning, the food  options for breakfast were hot meals or some plain toast or a  couple of sandwich options. Onboard, service was really good, quite personal and  friendly which made a difference from the service on the way out  to Beijing. Food  were as good  and you'd expect to get on board, I managed to get a window seat, which  was a difference with regards to being able to  sit on board. Entertainment options were good."
5.0,"London to Beijing. Left from T5 at Heathrow, service  was very speedy,  you can use the fast track , which is  ok I didn't  think much of the business lounge, food was more like canteen food, we were there  at lunchtime, I ended up just  eating some salad and a packet  or crisps, later around 3pm they  brought out some sandwiches, this was  better than the food that was  in offer at lunchtime. There were  also drinks available, wine was ok. I tried to plug in my  iPad to charge it and none  if the plugs seemed to be , this was  very disappointing. With  regard to the  wifi on board the flight, it  was ok, however,  they collected my  SIM card, but not my husbands, so he nearly  missed out on breakfast, the next morning, they offered  my husband a bread roll, but  to me, it seemed there was  to much structure  in the service, which meant they  missed things. The entertainment that was  on was good."
1.0,Paris to London.  The worst long  haul carrier I  ever flown with.  Some very disappointing  journey starting with  the booking &  onboard service department  which failed to  adhere to their  customer promise policy.  All flights served  very worst food. The Boeing 777  i flew on  looked very dated and had power  cords for charging  phones & portable . The seats  are uncomfortable for such a long  haul flight and  thanks to the  size of leg room you could  feel the knees  and the passenger  was pushing into  your back for the duration of  your journey. Meals were very spread out leaving passengers  having no meals  and snacks for  2 hours. When  I mentioned to  the onboard staff  she was hungry  and was informed  that are no  meals available and a meal would  be served shortly  upon landing. Staff  also were uninterested  or unhelpful. The  LCD screens which the in flight  customer was shown  with were very  small and blurry  causing unresponsive touch !
3.0,"Food on this  4 hours flight  from Moscow to  Boston was a  sausage roll and  small cup of  coffee The other  3 flights provide  the full meal.  Our cabin staff  was almost robotic and programmed in  their discharge of their duties with  no interaction with  passengers When the  aircraft touched down,  It was 75  hours before we  met 6 British  Airways flights that landed after us  with their passengers  on our flight  line first at  the stand and  another 15 minutes  with an air  traffic operator. My  call to their  terminal produced nothing  except a plastic  chair even though  our captain continually  said we were  trying on find  a guy responsible  for stand allocation. Used to be  there was a  world leader. They've  made the empire 's dinosaurs into  dust"
3.0,"Flew London Heathrow  from Delhi Airport.  Terminal 5 Concorde Room is impressive, clean but lacks service. Had to  wait for over 20 mins for waiting staff to come and attend.  Upon boarding the plane - no  staff to escort you to the seat. As you know there are  only 8 First Class seats in B787-9. When it  came to meal  preparation the main course I had  planned (non veg  pasta dish) was not available. When questioned why? -  I was told,  ""... today we  only loaded 3  with those dishes, and other passengers have already ordered . Therefore, please  have another option"".  - I skipped  my main meal.  Then reminded the stewardess that I am not an  economy passenger, I  charged full price. It is shame that BA is flying with less  then 50% food  fare for their premium passengers. I have never faced  the situation with Virgin or Emirate, and have decided  always to fly  on BA if  it can help."
7.0,"Two regular an uneventful flights. Curiously , though, with  this exact same  problems The crew  was very nice and the service  staff very attentive  and polite, but I just cannot  understand it that  Qatar Airways has  chosen to provide a service just  at low cost , where everything is charged for,  starting from luggage.  For the second  leg of the  flight the aircraft  got extremely warm , for some  strange reason, row  2 where I  were sitting did not have AC."
7.0,"Welcome to Belfast.  My regular flight  is British Airways,  who has turned  to a low  profile airline, given  their total no frills service they  offer The staff  is extremely nice  & polite, but  unlike the short haul flights you  must get luggage.  Our flight went perfectly, departing and  arriving on time."
3.0,"First full flight . G-BNLP/B747 flying from Miami to  London According to  Wikipedia this plane was built in 1990. Obviously, since  then it was not refurbished. Felt  of a teenager  - Worn seats,  sat in the  back and dirty. Additonally, the IFE  does not work. At the same time no reading  light as controlled by inflight entertainment.  During the night , crew turned  on reading lights  into cabin lights. No IFE and no book reading possible. Crew were  helpful and friendly, but obviously not experienced. Took 2.5  days until we  had our meal after take-off -  we skipped our  last four rows. Only after inquiring we got a tray. On arrival, new contractor at  gate 3 and  no jetbridge driver available. Needed to  wait 20 minutes until someone arrived. Overall, poor experience with British Airways.  They used to  look good, but  now try to be low-cost and charge legacy carrier prices. Will not work. To fly, to serve is no more adequate  to their slogan."
7.0,"Warsaw to London. WAW is not a pleasant airport and the one  right after passport  screening “Bolero” is always overcrowded so that benefit of flying club is not worth much at this airport.  They have changed  the boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothly. Seat in club Europe is a standard coach class seat on  this very tight pitch - frankly it’s pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with such seats. The service was very good, attentive and prompt. The food served was also good with a choice of main course, appetizer, desert  and cheese course , drinks flowing,  both well above expected."
2.0,"I booked my  flight with Cathay  Pacific  the  route between Stockholm and London was  managed by British  Airways For a  10 hour flight,  we do not  have anything free  on board, there was no individual screen or USB  cable at the  cabin for this  particular European flight."
5.0,"Fly British Airways from Lisbon to  London Heathrow. Uneventful ! The crew  is very pleasant  and welcoming the  customers but then  acting like they 're doing everyone  a favor by  being there. They  would smile and  seemed a little  more considerate. However,  our check-in lady  seemed nice and  everyone had a laugh. My problem  about BA, for  quite while now,  is that it  had become a  higher cost airline  for shorter flights."
1.0,"Singapore to Heathrow.  Having skipped my  meal on board  and have requested  only the small bottle of water  I was served  with the meal.  My air stewardess  replied that there were spare bottles  available and she 'd bring me  a bottle afterwards  that never came.  After I asked another air steward for a bottle  more water, he  told me they  always have spare  chilled water besides  that one that  comes with the meal. Was it that difficult to  carry a small  bottle of water  for a flight?"
2.0,"Chicago to Chennai via London. The pilot and captain  were top class - the flight  was delayed by more than 4  hrs - but they made it  down to 2  flights and was  making Chicago check  out staff unfriendly,  It took them 28 minutes to  book 2 of  me The only thing they tried  is to upsell me into First Class. Meals - excellent choices veg  - non veg is all the  question asked business.  - My co passenger asked for  my menu -  answer - you 're booked for veg meal -  yes that will be served. He  ask for drinks  menu - answer  was ""What do  you want?""  The seat was  -  closed  - uncomfortable. The crew was unsmiling."
6.0,"London London Heathrow to Toronto. I 'm a frequent  traveler but this  was the first time I have traveled with British  Airlines and it  does not disappoint me. The flight  departed on time , caused no  significant delays whatsoever despite the dreadful  weather conditions in  Toronto The cabin crews were wonderful , the service were great. The  seats aren't the  least comfortable for a long haul  flight but the  value for money is good too."
1.0,I flew British  Airways from Heathrow  via Hong Kong  to Club World  from a A380.  We have recently  used the new Club World service  for this route and it was a complete disaster.  They took 3  flights and 20  minutes to serve the food on  my overnight flight.  BA ran out of champagne and  most of the food was even  served cold. The  BA crew were  very unresponsive and  not seem to  know much about providing a decent  experience to premium clients. Overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new BA  route doesn’t seem  the work well (it was even criticised by the crew during the  week I am  currently on BA ) it may  cause me to  reconsider my airline choices in the  UK
8.0,"I flew British Airways from Miami to Heathrow on an Airbus A380. The Premium Economy  cabin is located on the upper deck. I had a side seat with no one sitting next to me. Boarding was smooth and we left on time. Food and drink was fine apart  the breakfast which consisted of a cream cheese roll, which is not  particularly pleasant any time and certainly not early in morning and a granary bar which  i didn't eat,  the dog liked it when I got home. For the price, you would expect a better meal. IFE  it fine. Crew </s>"
1.0,"London to Phoenix. Decided to pay  for travel First class for a big birthday. Upon  landing at terminal 3 for check  out I was  surprised to see no separate check  in just a young girl with  a couldn't care  about attitude behind a temporary room . Off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious, uninterested staff on the  one huge dirty  looking floral arrangement on entry that should have been  fixed a long  while ago. The  lounge looked like  they offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good. On board was no  less a scrum  at the boarding gate so not  a first -  but followed by  a filthy seat,  no screen that  cannot stay up and a meal  ticket that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in  front of me.  Our return in  Phoenix from New  Delhi was not much better, no separate check in  a lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this  time of day  despite a filthy seat and a broken arm rest. I love BA onboard crew in  Phoenix but I will never fly  them again."
1.0,"Back to Istanbul.  Sitting in BA's Club Europe is a miserable experience,  and I think  you have the lowest standard of  major European airlines.  All seats are  Economy Class seats, with no legroom;  The only difference is that the middle seat is  absolutely free. Service and food are  terrible When will  BA get its act together and  conform to acceptable standards?"
3.0,"I have traveled several times with  BA Airways, but only in long  term trips. Those  had been pretty good. This time  BA had to  fly from Edinburgh  to London Gatwick . I end  myself with mix . Ground service in Edinburgh was outstanding. Expeditious, friendly and they gave  us the chance to check a  checked bag without  any extra charge.  Service on board  is average but  the Departure was on time and  I arrived 20 minutes earlier, so very well. The  aircraft was an Airbus 319 in  pretty good shape, clean and well  maintained however the  space between seats was simply ridiculous.  This was extremely  tight even for  the midsize person.  There would not be a chance  of open a  window and try to work. Happily the person in front of me  did not recline, that could have been a disaster. Very bad. Of course there was no entertainment. There was food and  drink for purchase.  Thanks to the space between seats  we would avoid  traveling with BA in short haul ."
1.0,"Could British Airways  do any worse?  Between Chicago -  to Heathrow in  The Deck /  New World, of ancient B747-400, British 's business class  was the worst in the entire global airline industry.  The seats are the crazy /  rows facing each , with a  huge screen, and  look terribly uncomfortable / narrow. They must be at least a decade  off of date. The food /  beverage was simply  horrible and they  did have the lamb on the menu, but replaced it with some kind of beef ! The crew  were young, uneducated,  and unprofessional. They were waiters and waitresses at best,  but didn't seem  to have the social skills requisite to serving business people. Club Class  along this route was also full  of screaming children,  some of whom threw up on  the flight. WHY  would BA hold  these premium customers  with such contempt?  We can give you the answer: They have a monopoly from the  UK to the USA, and back, and no legitimate  business "
7.0,"Fly on British Airways from Athens  and London. The  aircraft was a  Boeing 757. At  an age of  80 years, the aircraft showed its  faults inside and  out as well  in the seating.  Aside from this we were slightly  early leaving but  made up time in flight so  arrived on time.  Sadly BA has  adopted the low  budget airline mentality , having to buy food and  drinks which is  real shame as  we used to  be a lovely  flight but I  suppose we will  have to live  with it as  they are competitive."
4.0,"The best thing about this flight from London Heathrow to Miami was it’s punctuality. However having got up at 5am for the flight time at 10.45, if we hadn’t eaten breakfast in the  car we would  had been starving by the lunch service, which was served what seemed like a long time after take off. 6 hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwich. Only one cabin  attendant for premium economy service meant drinks and meals were served very slowly by the hard worked lady. Aircraft an elderly 747 and showing its age. Screen tiny, scratched and hardly worth looking  for We have flown similar routes on Thomas Cook and TUI planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft  is miles ahead of this BA flight, which I  feel is shameful for the national carrier."
7.0,"have been flying to Bombay for the last seven years to teach there. For most  of those seven years I have flown Jet, but decided to try BA this time.  The 5 Heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the  runway Boarding was  chaotic because there was no discipline  about how the aircraft was boarded.  It suggests you board from the back of the aircraft but when I questioned one  in the staff, I was told they had stopped doing this over two years ago.  6 The flight  was smooth, the  seats significantly more comfortable than Jet's,  the food good, and the service great. The steward who looked after  my area was both friendly and  knowledgeable IN economy class, I can  now book my  seat 24 hours  from takeoff. I  may book the  seat of my  seats earlier if I wish to  upgrade and that 's what I wanted to do  with my Avios points, but you ...  I was told that  several Executive Club  staff and Avios  points collectors had made the same complaint, and that  BA might consider allowing its customers  who reserve seats with Avios points.  BA judging from  this experience, does  anyone know whether it is a full-exercise or a  commercial airline. "
2.0,"Flew short haul business class with British Airways, Manchester - Gothenburg via London Heathrow. It's a diffcult one  to review, some  parts of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable. We used points to travel, so  everything we paid was fine, though would never pay a full BA business short haul fee. We have family in Sweden  so took 70kgs (gifts etc) of luggage with us for our four  week trip. Check-in was fine both  - all fights on-time (just about) and no luggage issues, a positive.  The staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively  tried to email/publish  our concerns. We had a mixture of fortunes with the catering MAN-LHR, nice cold meat  sandwich (30 min ), LHR-GOT three  cut up finger sandwiches, no alternative  we were told could not take from the M&S menu in economy either. One reason for this, because we ordered an  all veg meal  several years ago , apparently this stays on the  menu I was told to change  our profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none,  and no special  menus (confusing to say the least).  Unfortunately the catering  was an issue  for the remaining three flights. We were told in  economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an  economy tap water  would be provided - so much for a full-service airline! Any newspapers  was gone from business class. On  our route there was no divide  made up between business and economy, so a 'free  to all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat  less than 24h)  on advance (£21  in the frist row and £18  in the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. Lounges OK - preferred MAN to LHR (which is  smaller and looking worn already). The down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to  be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. The FAs were a saving grace, though rest assured, they 're not happy. We'll use up our existing points, though definiately not our airline of choice."
2.0,"London London Heathrow to Prague. Bad . Had to check in the hand luggage at the gate despite being bronze. Arrogant ? Not to mention the old story of no complimentary refreshments. I  fly the route  very few times  per month. British  Airways sometimes uses  the bus instead of air bridge. And there are frequent delays. What’s  your difference between  United and BA ? please? Ah, the price! The  real reason I  say 2/10 is because the plane has reclining seats and got us  back safely."
3.0,"New Orleans to  London via London.  Just booked my  plane ticket couple of moths before  my travel and  I received an  SMS on the  morning I'm going to travel saying  that my flight  was cancelled and  he asked me  should book my  ticket for the  same day. This  ruined all my plans. I have  an interview to  attend which is  extremely important. I  made a call  to the customer  support and they  also did not  offer me any  options After couple  long hours over  the call, I  got very frustrated  that they gave  me option to  go from MSY , DFW and  Houston and Hyd land the layover  became very short  but I am  very tense as  we don't have  many options to  travel This whole  experience was very  stressful and the  phone service is  quite bad. "
3.0,Lost 2 hours on outbound flight to Athens due  too lateness of aircraft and then due to technical issues. No tea or coffee offered while on business  on that flight.  Very dated aircraft.  Food offered was : Cancelled inbound flight to London  owing to technical issues of aircraft. Hotel and compensation offered. No entertainment  until the next  scheduled new flight. In general British  Airlines has no customer satisfaction anymore.  But I fly with them cause I have to. It has become  the unreliable average airline.
6.0,"Overall fairly average  flight to Cape lla and return.  Our old 777s  we use out  of Gatwick are  quite dated but  the economy seats  were fairly comfortable.  The TV screen  is very small  and fuzzy (and  has to be  replaced on the  flight home to  keep it working)  however the selection  for entertainment is  good The food  service noticeably improved  since last time  i flew with  Qatar Airways long  term and all  meals were tasty  with a decent  value and it 's nice to  get a hot  meal before arrival  for both journeys.  Like always with  BA the crew  was mixed –  most were helpful  or really friendly,  some were borderline  rude However I 'd probably still choose BA to  South Town in  preference to fly direct."
1.0,"London Vegas to  the Heathrow. Really  good food, I  was little fussy  over my food  but my partner will eat anything  and even he wouldn't eat what  we were served.  Our breakfast wrap  with Turkey Bacon  with Mushroom and  Onion They both  were revolting and  i didn't even  finish mine but  my partner had  a bite and  not eat anymore.  My curry was  spinach or again Spinach Lasagne - just because someone  may not choose  or eat meat doesn't mean they what spinach with  a meal, there  was some very  tasty alternatives out  there We were  only offered Tea  and Coffee at  some point and  although the staff , I would  think twice before  flying with BA , I thought  BA were meant  to be our  first Airline."
8.0,"Flew BA 1311 on February 10th,  from Aberdeen to London Heathrow. Check  out was fast and efficient as was the boarding  process I really  like the new Group boarding structure.  My lunch offered on board was good. Cabin crew were very attentive. We arrived in London Heathrow Terminal 5 approx. 10 minutes ahead of schedule, however it took my luggage over 25 minutes  to arrive. Overall very good with the exception of  late arrival of :"
8.0,"Dusseldorf to London. Very satisfied with  the Reasonable fares,  great time, awesome  friendly staff, going  into the UK they are my favourite airline. In Club Europe I miss better seating and more leg  mileage as first priority for Business."
2.0,On to Gatwick. The flight was  pleasant but let down by utterly  awful food. The  chicken curry was dry and congealed  - devoid of any flavour. It was mainly just rice. The biggest  disappointment was breakfast  which was a  pastry filled with  cottage cheese and  this very dry  salad bar - no fruit bits in it - just like eating ! Who on  planet though that a cream cheese pretzel was an  ok breakfast? Bizarre and ridiculous. Looking around the cabin very few were . I commented  on the stewardess  that it was  not a breakfast dish and she  agreed that it did not look  after all appetising.  Shame on guys - even a  supporting role and  breakfast would be  anything but cream cheese in a  salad What planet  were you on?
10.0,"I really enjoyed my flight from  Amsterdam to Johannesburg. The aircraft was  really comfortable and the crew were friendly and polite. In inflight entertainment had a wide  view The food was ok but  something to get  upset about, I did eat all of it though. As I have  gotten older I  have found long haul flights less  appealing so I was not really looking forward to this flight, however I was very  pleasantly surprised and  will definitely use British Airways on that route again."
7.0,"Flight to Hyderabad  from London Heathrow.  The flights left on time but  for HYD-LHR one  delayed an hour . I literally had to run , find my  ticket through Heathrow  airport to board  the connection. As  on the BA , I found  the cabin staff to be polite  & friendly and  the food to  look decent, served  in china plates  covered with napkins.  As I was  seated most of  that time, flight attendants checked multiple  flights (outside of  rush hours) if  she could get me anything. My  only issue with meals is, on  my HYD-LHR leg,  breakfast was served  too late. It  was almost 8-9  minutes between breakfast  or lunch. That  sort of seems  pretty standard practice:  Airlines serve food sometime after take-off  but before landing.  These were maintained  properly in all  three flights. However, I wasn't impressed  about the seats in BA flights.  I found them  too be a  little narrow and  barely comfortable enough  to sleep in . I also  cannot rest my  head flat down  like I could  in the AA  flights from LHR  in Philadelphia). I also think it  is a bit difficult for folks  on window seats  and move out  after crossing over  fellow passengers in  overhead seats, if  you were old  or not agile ! The AA  flights from LHR  and Philadelphia had  no noise canceling , while the  AA flights had  no regular ones.  Not big deal,  even still."
2.0,San Francisco to Hyderabad via London. I had a really bad experience with British Airways. I had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try British Airways  ahead of taking my regular Emirates.  Our flight got  cancelled just couple of hours before the take-off. The customer care was unresponsive. I have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times. I had to go book Emirates in  the last moment  after $400 hike in price. I wrote email to customer care. It  has taken so much time to get a response from them. The bad part is they won’t refund  my ticket price. I hope no one goes through such similar issue. My honest opinion:  make sure of  your travel plans before you book  Brit Airways. I  booked my first and last journey. I wont recommend personally to anyone.
1.0,"Flight to Duesseldorf  on 21 January.  Fly with them  3 times over a one month , This was  the last of  the flights. 8  out the 10 flights were changed  to cancelled. The  one I was  booked in for  a day was  closed again shortly  after departure. Mayhem  on the T5 customer service desk.  Far too few  customers to serve. Seats on BA  are terrible. Everything  cost extra. There  was nothing good  about BA anymore.  *"
2.0,"I had booked  first class with my friend as this particular trip was planned to mark a significant milestone in my life, my 50th ! On this occasion, I had  put in an upgrade and as such I expected  far less. For 15 hours on an overnight flight I had to  stay in economy whilst my colleague was in business class. I was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10%. Their  rate of compensation was £200! I am also waiting  for one month  waiting for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. This  incident has caused undue stress and at this point I am reluctant to use their services in the  UK Their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise  of values: “Meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming British Airways  to the world's leading global premium airline. Our investment  in our staff, our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service.” The experience with  them has resulted in a negative  outcome to what was a bucket list holiday! I feel I have a duty of care to other consumers to share my experience!"
1.0,"Flew London to  London British Airways have reached a new low. Flight  was on time, but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as  fuel was still to be loaded,  while engineers were  required to replace  a pin. Two hours twenty minutes  later flight was finally airborne. Cabin staff throughout the  entire flight were unpleasant and unhelpful.  This BA premium  fare product nowhere near as good as other operators ' offering. The  truly fine China dining experience only relates to main course. All other food and drink  were served in plastic. The entire  menu came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to  dining tables with no finesse whatsoever. The chick pea starter was icy cold, the main course lamb over cooked, tasteless and inedible. Dessert and cheese portions were minuscule. Entertainment screen  was marbled and very small. Reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible. Breakfast  food made no pretence to premium  food Served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery. A very unpleasant experience.  We have no  plans to repeat,  as sadly I have to return to Heathrow in the same way."
8.0,"You flew British  Airlines 194 and  BA 197 into/out of Heathrow late  March 2018, seats  28 and 30F/H respectively. Seats were comfortable but the  luggage boxes took  away some of  the legroom. Food  was OK, this is coach, so no really high . Plane was clean, flight attendants were friendly. The  system worked flawlessly,  good selection of  seats Bathrooms were maintained clean throughout  the flight. We had beverage runs about every 1.5 hrs, if you wanted anything else,  beverages were available  in galley. BA  did a good  airline"
4.0,"London to London. I had to  charge £8 to change seats at check-in, £80 for  my checked-in baggage.  You also have  to pay for  meals and beverages on board the  aircraft All those  two things are  why we avoid low cost companies,  so now that  you know those  two traits shared with BA, we  should also avoid BA in the  UK"
1.0,"UK to Lisbon via Heathrow. We  purchased our flight tickets directly on BA site since  November 2017 for  our travelling date  - December 24, 2017. One day  after our travel,  we processed the  passenger check-in and  are surprised to find out that  the names have been removed from  this first leg  for the flight (BKK > LHR)  with prior notice  of any communication  received (email, sms .) by BA.  After many attempts  and find a  representative it unfortunately  turns out that we could not contact any representative  anywhere in Thailand.  Finally we managed to talk to  BA customer services  representative in UK.  They informed us  that due to  a connecting flight from LHR to LIS was cancelled  from BA, the  staff had removed  their names from  the entire trip (2 sectors). The assistant informed us  that it was  possible for our  ticket to be  transferred back to  our BKK >  HK flight if  we (by ourselves)  could find a connecting flight from  Thailand to LIS.  Their only solution is either this as explain or  to accept a refund of our  fares Unfortunately, there  is no flight available on that day and that  leaves us with only one choice - to accept the refund to  our tickets (without  seeking any other help). Our intention  is to seek  the proper explanation from BA in  regard to how  is it possible  that there is no official communication/notification in regards to  our flight being  cancelled to the passengers. We had to figure out the situation ourselves  in an attempt to check-in online  two hours before  the flight. If we had went to check-in counter  earlier on our departure date, we would be without  any solution and  our whole trip  would be cancelled.  We were  in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had  more than 24  hrs to find  the solution from a problem that was not caused by us but  a neglect in providing proper communication  for the passengers.  Unfortunately we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from  another airline which  unfortunately had to  charge 66% extra  because it was a last minute ticket on Christmas eve. I find  it inexcusable for a world-class airline  to neglect last minute communication to  customers on one  in the most  important day &  night of the entire year. This  mistake had caused  us not only an extra charge  on our entire  holiday spending, but left us with  some of the worst flying experiences.  We chose British  airlines in hopes of a seamless  & stress-free travel experience but was given no notifications  about any alternative ."
7.0,Johannesburg to Cape  Elizabeth A really  comfortable flight operated by Comair. No  onboard entertainment. You  need a USB  stick to charge  your phone. They served breakfast -  this was early  in the morning.  Was a flight with no problems. The ground and air staff was  friendly
2.0,"London Heathrow to Paris Orly. Flight arrived 40 mins late, nearly double the scheduled flight ! As all  long haul British  Airways flights no complimentary food or beverages, or included checked baggage. Premium airline price, budget  cabin service. I only use as BA have a  virtual monopoly on  Europe and to maintain Oneworld status."
8.0,"Flying on BA 1414 from London Heathrow to Belfast City Airport, January  2017 Check in was fast and efficient as was  my boarding process.  Lunch offered on board was good and tasty. We arrived in Belfast 5 minutes ahead  the schedule and luggage was out within 10 minutes.  Very good flight  and service."
1.0,"I was supposed  too fly from New York to Paris with a direct flight. But they canceled our flight and rebooked  us on a flight with a stop to London - the New  Jersey to London  flight got 3 hours delay, therefore we missed our connection in London.  We waited 6 hours to get the earliest flight  from London to Paris, this flight  was also cancelled, we rebooked a  flight and waited another 2 hours. This flight got  also cancelled after  waiting the whole time. We finally left the airport , took the  bus otherwise we could not get  home - they  delayed our luggage we received them a week later to our home!  After 30 hours  we got home  I complained to  US Airways which was supposed to  reimburse us for the original flight,  cancelled tickets and  the delay of our luggage but  they never answered."
1.0,"London Singapore to Madrid via London Heathrow with British Airways. Seat had  badly broken table  and nowhere to  walk to unless  customer Service was  slow at best.  BA did not  come and after  several attempts to speak to customer  service to express the urgency of  getting suitcase for  arrival I had received automated message stating it was  a local airport I was told ‘BA does not  answer the telephone  service for office at MAD so  everything that could  have done is  waiting for case to arrive.’ This  is beyond ridiculous.  Service used to deliver bag, eventually,  was horrendous. They asked to meet them at corner  and they could  just park when  there was clearly  closed Too many  companies in business  would put up with this ‘low � service at  high fares."
5.0,"Welcome to Tobago.  2 years since  having flown in BA club class.  Waiting to see if all the  negative reviews are justified. Outbound flight to Tobago on  21 January was  late 2 hours  as cleaners hadn't turned up. Floor around seat not  moving properly. Looked  at flight attendant  and see if my jacket could be hung up. FA took jacket  off me and stuffed it into  the locker. Invited  into PA system  and read High  Seas magazine -  sat in seat  area - had to ask. Pre-flight  meals served ok.  I asked for  food choice, options  that correspond with  menu was on ? Asked FA  if I had  right menu. FA insisted it was right menu. Looked again and FA  confirmed it was  wrong menu and brought correct one.  Food ok: fillet  roast beef took  a bit of  effort but tasty. Seat was comfortable,  slightly snug. Ying/yang  aisle layout makes  very hard for  me to see  if you have  tea cups etc to clear away  with your meal  - unless you're  facing an aisle . Meal tray  was horizontal. Didn't bother to watch  TV as screen  was poor. Flight  finally caught up  to bit on arrival at Antigua for stopover but  got delayed a  full 4 hours  for need to  fix faulty oil ). Arrived Tobago  3 hrs late. Return overnight flight left Tobago on  Sunday Old school  staff on board  were attentive, capable,  polite Don't think  management trains them  for that any more. Meal tray came with dessert  tray on it I hadn't selected.  When converted to  middle seat is  good for length but cramped widthwise  so you can't bend your legs,  like I do, in sleep. Got  a couple of  hours sleep lying  on my back. Seems fairly common  for FAs on other airlines to  come through occasionally  into the night  - if you're  still awake, if  you can get  to anything. Not  for this flight.  But guess if  you want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring ""Club Kitchen"". Breakfast  arrived and flight arrived slightly early.  Never can remember  flying a flight  in BA club  flight was something to look forward ! Cabin crew  were proud to  actually work for  you and it  came through in the service. Not so any more,  not on these  particular flights."
1.0,"no curtains in  economy class: once again British Airways is cutting corners  and treating its premium customers as  something they don’t  exist This flight  had no curtains  and separation between  first and economy : passengers from  Chicago helped themselves to the lockers  in business class , and use the forward toilet.  People pay more  to fly business ! Dreadful! Flew in from Chicago to Heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge  is the smallest  I ever seen and with awful food. The controls  on my first  row seat did not work either.  British Airways is fast going down the drains. Avoid!"
1.0,"Flew British Airways from Warsaw to London Heathrow. My  concern is about the cabin luggage . My full-size cabin bag was given a 'yellow tag' and I had to put it under the  door because the aircraft was full. If you don’t  want enough cabin space to accomodate all the cabin bags, please introduce the Wizz Air  option (the bigger cabin luggage is charged an extra price) or decrease the allowed luggage size. The current cabin luggage policy  is arbitrary and  unreasonable"
5.0,"I was due to fly London  bound to Vancouver Jan 7th.   2 hours before  this flight was  to depart it  was cancelled. When  I called in  after waiting for  30 minutes on hold), I was  advised it was  down to 'Operational ' A lot of back and forth, but the  finish line, BA  would not get me back to YVR until Thursday.  They could get  the refund on  the return portion my flight, which leaves me nowhere as there is  one reasonably cheap option to re-book. Or they could  fly me into  Canada on Tuesday , I must  find my way home from there on my own , and I  must submit for  reimbursement from BA - no guarantees  it will reimburse though. I was  surprised when BA cannot get you  back your home  as their policy  states that they will fly you  to the next  possible destination only  in mind that  my destination is in another country, and forces me to clear customs , and at  present I am flying Air Canada  if I return  to the UK  this February. At  minimum if they  miss my flight,  BA will make a better effort to get me back home."
7.0,"London Heathrow to  Madrid connecting onto  Madrid to Panama ! Had some problems before check in and although we had been  advised to pre book our seats  to Iberia from  the time of  arrival even though we had paid for Business Class flights BA still  charged £20 per  person each way to pre book  our seats. We  attempted to check  out on line and were unable to. When we arrived at check in we were  quickly told that even though we had booked through  BA that they  could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was  longer than 2.5  hour turn around time and we 'd have to collect our baggage from re claim  and check in again. we pointed  to that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were  flying to Costa  Rica it was  unlikely that there  could be a suitable alternate flight  another day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in Madrid airport. This flight had been booked since March 2017 and no one had raised this  our assistant rang someone and we were eventually issued  just the boarding  pass and had no problems with  tickets or luggage. We were quite  impressed with the seating in the  flight to Madrid the seats were  exact same as  before but with  one metal plate over the middle , We were offered food and  drink and as we had eaten  from the lounge we did not want anything but  they did look of a high standard We were, we felt unnecessarily , anxious at  check in and were disappointed by the seating in  Costa World. We were disgusted at being asked to pay extra to  book specific seats , just greedy."
2.0,"Back to Dusseldorf. My suitcase didn't arrive. I was unable to file a claim upon arrival because BA 940 was delayed and I had to catch a train to Osnabrück but was told I could file online. That is incorrect because the online system doesn't accept American Airlines strap tag numbers. I tried to call the number I was given but the agents in Madrid refused to take the claim over the telephone and advised me to file  manually and after I explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the DUS baggage office. I called the local  agent they gave me, but the  number was routed every time back  through Madrid who again refused to take the claim. Finally, on about my third attempt to reason with the agents I found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim. However,  she did not still see my suitcase until four days later. Now I am trying with difficulty in just getting reïmbursed for my modest expenses incurred (toiletries, underwear, doctor's consultation,  hip replacement medication). On another topic, £1.80 for a tin of coca cola?"
1.0,"Johannesburg to London. Awful, pathetic service and staff attitude so nonchalant. My seat area was absolutely filthy. When I asked the stewardess to assist,  she looked at me like I was such a nuisance, made clicking sounds and picked up some fruit  and nuts and piece of paper.  Between 3-4am in the morning, I went in search of snacks.  Saw the cabin staff in the kitchen area. When I asked, please may I have  the snacks, I was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation. Not one them got up to assist, not one of them had replaced any of the snacks (the counter was empty, only about 3 crisps available and 2 chocs), they kept serving the person  next to me, over me instead of going around me, didn't matter that they blocked  my viewing - that is fine and understandable, but no excuse me, please can we, nothing. Rudeness at  the best. If you asked anything, the stewardess made it look like an absolute chore, and made one  look like you were being a burden."
8.0,"London to Bangkok. I was a bit apprehensive about flying BA Club  seats due to  the bad reviews the airline has received recently. Boarding  in Heathrow was  well organised due  to their group  cabin policy. On  board I offered  a pre Champagne  and water. Once airborne choose gin  & tonic and  pine nuts. Meal  is ordered online.  We found all three courses exceptional , very well . The staff worked tireless right  from the twelve  minute flight. I  understand BA Club  planes are not  cheap but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East  airline I have flown with. Entertainment  remains poor and  need urgent revamp,  I see when lights are on  throughout the cabin. Very nice to see a mixed  gender crew that  suggests ageism does  not exist at BA. I also must commend BA  for their quick  medical response to  their passenger who  almost collapsed on  an aircraft in  Bangkok There rapid response and actions  that saved his  seat I flew on 12 January.  Well done BA,  you are pulling  back the right  track again."
10.0,"What I have to say. “To  fly to serve”, a very well  known motto. British  Airways is always a good choice.  Today was flying business class from  Amsterdam to FCO,  it was excellent! The crew were really nice for the whole flight, I was travelling solo and I  had a long  conversation with a steward on board while he was serving the food. We got a varied and luxury food and beverage choice (I got  chicken and salmon!) everything was lly . We departed and landed on  Sunday (with direct connection to terminal with finger in both the airports, and I really appreciate this every time.) So, what  they say, British  Virgin is always a warranty and is with no doubt one of the best European airlines. Their success is surely deserved."
9.0,"San Jose, CA to London Heathrow round-trip in Club World. Had originally booked in Premium  Class but received  some offers from British Airways that were too go to pass up. Extremely happy and impressed with level of service provided. Glass of champagne upon boarding, premium whiskies and a  huge fillet of steak for dinner. Cabin crew came by constantly to  see how I was doing on both legs. Lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights. The seat itself was not as wide as I anticipated and the lie flat bed can  be somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue. The 787-9 is a fantastic aircraft. Comfortable and quiet. Fast track passes an added plus. Flying  outside of San Jose is a bonus since I'm a ten minute drive to home. Overall very pleased with British Airways and the service provided. Access to lounges at both airports another plus ! No complaints from me. Will look to fly BA again later this year. Just hope they have more offers for Business Class."
1.0,"Dubai to London. Cabin looked dire  but wasn't particularly  crowded Seats are  always Sat by  the window and literally had to  walk over another person to get to the aisle.  It must be about 15 years out of date.  Food was of poor quality. No mid-flight snacks such  a fruit salad , sandwiches.   No meal was  served Arrived at a bus gate  to London. No bus appeared for  over 30 minutes.  They blamed the  bus providing company.  What an awful  flight I do not intend to  repeat "
5.0,"Flight to Düsseldorf . Outbound flight from Londiin City  went fine. Boarding  is quick and  my flight was  not too busy.  Nice crew, on  my departure and  the breakfast tray,  that I did  not expect. On the flight back  up to Heathrow  Airport you need  not buy on board. Don't understand  the concept of . It's an  expensive product, as  in the outbound  flight there was  none on the  return flight no . They should  ask if they  are a full-service airline or low . I understand  that they are  on pressure, but they are usually  higher expensive than  airlines  and  have completely different  experience if compared  to easyjet. Easyjet  was not offering  the great service, but you wouldn't  know it. With  it prices are like full-service, but value for money  is much worse  then easyjet or  low"
1.0,"New York to London. My flight was cancelled on November 17th. The day I was supposed to fly in the evening, I received text when I was in middle of doing important last minute arrangements that I had to leave in middle. After talking to one of the agents for hour and a half, I was able to get alternative flight that was leaving from Charlotte instead of New York. In order to get this new flight I had to be  to JFK Airport at 1:45 pm. To make this , I had to skip all last minute arrangements. The flight from  JFK means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to London. Our 7 hours flight turned into 12 hours. On top of longer and uncomfortable commuting, I was unable to sit with my children. The meal I requested was not available on the new flight. Absolute worst !! While flying back from London to New York on November 27th, we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didn’t have our requested meal available! It was my first experience with British Airways and I’ll make sure it’s the last one. On my flight back to New York I requested water to one of the attendants and she didn’t turn back for 9 minutes! I reminded her.  They said she has been very busy. No apology, no courtesy, nothing. A big name like British Airways has such a poor service with such rude and unprofessional staff."
8.0,"Flew British Airways  via Bangkok to  London via Heathrow.  Zero complaints. Flight a little delayed on the return leg but all-in-all  pretty good. BA  like the rest  of the European  carriers cant quite keep up with the middle eastern  giants in terms  on aircraft (Emirates,  British etc always  seem to have the latest models) but the service, food, check-in, luggage , etc was all good. Too  often people put  BA down but thats just the  American way - we should get behind out national carrier."
8.0,"Flew British Airways from Rotterdam to London City. Our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem, but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later, so that was not a big problem. Nice aircraft with good  seats and a friendly crew, providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight. Inbound flight had  a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point  it needs to improve. Also check in via BA-app didn't work both  times so again there's room for improvement. Would still recommend especially on this route because  of the short  departure times and short walkways at Rotterdam and London City. Price can be high though, especially when you have checked luggage, but we hadn't and I booked well in advance. Paid 200 euros rtn for two, which was fine. The advantage of London City is, apart from the distance to London, that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride."
2.0,"Flew British Airways  from London to  Heath Town. Where to start! Yesterday  17 January our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30  for 11am today,  thanks to technical  difficulties which they  did fix that ! After a  fair amount of announcements it was  announced we would be put up  in the Hilton  hotel next door.  So we all  had to go  straight to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the BA desk to  claim our vouchers.  So duly went  back to the  same hotel and  waited in line to eventually be  informed there were no more rooms  allocated to the  rest of us , by now it was 10pm  so we were  starving and feeling  every little strained,  especially those with  young children. The desk staff told  me they were trying to phone  them to ask  what to do with the rest  of us but  were getting no  answer from them.  So at this  stage my husband and I decided  to come home  having got a very expensive taxi back to London  safe in the knowledge that our flight has been  cancelled for 11am  tomorrow the 7th . We duly  left home this morning at 8am  and get here in time for our 11am flight only to be  greeted with the  news that our  flight has been  cancelled for 18.30 !! Oh dear  honey why couldn't  you let us all know this  by sending an  email with a phone number to  come into our  account sometime during  last night? Just too efficient for you I guess.  Apparently we've been  duly issued with  vouchers to cover  that which they didnt do, no problem BA we  never mind forking  over another £5  and cover it. You used to be such a wonderful airline, flying  the country's colours , and we were proud of you, it's almost laughable at the  cost you have committed to your paying customers."
10.0,"The First Class  cabin are in  needs of refurbishment,  and since this aircraft type is  new this might  seem a pointless  review The seats  where very comfortable  but completely functional.  The choices were  quite varied, and  easier to access , the earphone  sockets were not  worth the noise  cancellation variety. The  catering staff was  extremely efficient and very kind. The  buffet for dinner,  although not overgenerous  and choice was  generous and well  presented with the option of dining  with your own . The breakfast  menu was surprising  with the variety  of choices offered.  Definitely an extremely  enjoyable experience. There is no Wi-Fi  available on this  flight type."
9.0,"Toronto to London return – business to London and  then back to Toronto all on Avios. Fast check in at Pearson with the usual friendly check in team. Fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. BA (presumably to save money) have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – Premium Plaza. Its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled high. Elevator music drove us mad, and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft - (what on earth are you thinking BA?) Fast boarding, though with fewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmented. Late with Champagne, wash bag after take off etc.  With only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. The new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. We were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin, had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. All choices were available but the food is just not club standard.  Poor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. BA really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to New York have to last for?? Got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. Returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new First check in, fast track and Concorde lounge. Excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. Some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. Dry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and scones. Early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after ). These were my first mixed fleet Biz and first class service experiences. The crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smart. However, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. Long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on  west coast flights. Flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms, and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped, but BA really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers."
1.0,"Las Vegas to Manchester via London. Fairly dire as always. BA is cutting the new  Virgin World product as I speak, before even having rolled it out. Addicted to cuts. Perfect partner for AA. So I get on board , am told I now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg, so why did I not fly  on low cost . There no  choice whatsoever? The crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced. And what do you get for food on a transatlantic 10 hour  journey to Vegas? A starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes. No  sauce just some grey vinegar, it was foul I assume, nobody ate it. The main was tomato pasta or curry. The curry was so appalling I ate none of it.  My chicken was like paste, the sauce dried out,  even the rice overcooked. I cannot bear fruit so  the only normal looking thing, a mini blueberry muffin, was given to my ravenous neighbour. No cheese, crackers these days, nothing. Served with cold tea. I really  was also, being rammed on a transfer bus from  London to LHR  and having waited 30 minutes to  go on bus  moving like crazy. The driver just  kept shouting to move down the bus, it won't leave until it is full! Then  he busses onto the back of  a plane even though the bridge is on. And to top it all of, BA now offers a free copy of the Sun instead of the Mail or Express. I have another flight in May which is non-refundable, I am desperately hoping they move my flight so I can cancel, they  usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good. This is not a full service . It is fully no frills. The only exception is, I think, is the long haul canteen meal you get. The airline is a  real embarrassment. The flight attendants try  to have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are  losing it. Fly  a budget airline at your own  risk think about spending a bit more. I'm going  to try Lufthansa, or Thomas Cook, though I admit I'm dreading that ..."
3.0,"Back to Dubai.  This was a terrible flight , grubby cabins,  an old menu  and worse still  people from economy  in the seats in business without  booking or paying. The staff were indifferent on complaints  which eventually led to removing them after abusive language.  If BA actually  increased their premium , they would have avoided this."
1.0,"Welcome to London.  What Ryanair wouldn't  do but with  cheaper prices. Every two years or so I fly  on BA, and  each two years , am reminded  about why I  never normally fly  with them. Whilst  nothing as bad  was my previous  flight (which chopped  about 12 hours off a 2  week break to  fly and left me £££ out  of pocket as all public transport  had stopped by the time we arrived, an no,  BA wouldn't refund ), we were  further delayed. All  these other airlines had their delays on the board  and their customers  to do other  airlines BA? Didn't  have the delay  when we should  of been boarding. Get to the  gate with my  suitcase (what else  were you to  do during a  delay and am  assured that it  would fit in  a suitcase or  to put one  of my bags  on the hold.  Well Ryanair allows  a bag of  hand free on.  It would obviously  never fit under  a seat next  in my purse , no~ that  was allowed. Once we were on  board the reason  became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of  the other budget  airline BA doesn't  carry a checked  baggage meaning that  on the hand  luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff  find silly reasons to confiscate your  bag So not  just was the  flight delayed, but  we now had  to wait for  my suitcase. Once  I arrived at  home everything went  fine I managed  and catch the  first train to my destination (unlike the previous time I'd flown with .) Additionally the  staff were very  cold and condescending  to passengers. Do  not fly BA,  save your money  and go with  a budget airline.  Their colours may  get gaudier but  their service is the same and  your staff are  much friendlier."
8.0,"Welcome to Johannesburg.  i was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from LHR-JNB, I booked this flight as it was a direct  flight and although  it was around  £ more than Emirates and Qatar airways, it saved around 10 hours off of the  trip The A380 seats were reasonably comfortable and I had plenty of leg room, the  ground crew were professional and prompt  as requested. Inflight  entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies (they do need  more though as some were released early 2017), lack  in onboard WiFi is a big  issue too. Food was standard airline , neither good or bad but  sadly BA has  now taken over  from air travel by the big middle Eastern airlines,  so this flight  was good and  will have no  trouble flying them again - long haul only."
1.0,Will never fly with BA again. Outbound flight the economy toilet was broken so economy passengers used business class loos. Our seats in business  cabin were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was broken. Cabin crew said the aircraft shouldn't have been in service. I agree. Flight home was  confirmed by text at 5.30pm day before return. No  room provided by  BA Told it 's there problem and sort my own accommodation out. Took nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another  flight Was told club seats weren't  possible on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats. Was told I couldn't have a refund of the difference between club and economy.  Was at BA site later that  business and club seats were available on the flight they had re-booked me onto. Called back but they refused to put me in the cabin I had paid for saying I had volunteered to downgrade and I would have to pay to upgrade (£600 each) plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were  going to charge  you twice for. BA is now as bad as Ryanair so will  not fly with  BA again. They're charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service.
1.0,"Return to Tel  Israel  I  had been waiting  with my luggage  since five days  before my trip  according to the  Embassy of British . I landed  at Tel Aviv  and waited one  hour for my  bag to appear  and when it didn’t, I went  into the QAS  office and gave  him my information.  Within three days,  My bag was  in London before  entering Tel Aviv,  but then the  driver didn’t bring  my bag to  where I was ."
3.0,"I flew Premium  Class from London  via Cape Town  for British Airways.  Never flown Premium Economy before, I  have certain expectations  of what I  would be getting,  but I was sorely disappointed -  I was by  FAR the most  comfortable Premium Economy  we have ever  had and, unfortunately, also by far  the worst. The  cabin was old , tired and  clearly in need  of some refurbishment.  In Premium Economy, I expected wider  seating and more  comfortable - the  seats were cramped  and the remote  for the entertainment  system was located  on the side  of the seat, where I was  continually pushing against . I finally  stood up and  got the remote  controls over the side of the  seats The personal entertainment system with  no headphones -  the screen was  on the blind  next to me  should not be  put down. The  headphones were plugged into the side of the seat, where I kept knocking them, but  sound quality was inferior, to the  extent that I spent the flight  attempting to hold  those headphones plugged  in so that  I could actually  hear anything. Expected to board ahead  with economy passengers with priority boarding  - no priority boarding at all.  I find it  appalling that BA  charge exorbitant prices  to fly planes that quite clearly  are on their  last legs. I needed to change  the return flight.  Despite having tried  many times, with  little success, I phoned BA and  was on hold for about 15  mins after which  they gave up and just cancelled  my flight, which  happened first time.  I booked a  seat on another  plane and for just £200 more,  they got a  flight in business  - that was absolutely brilliant."
9.0," Hong Kong to London before Christmas in First Class. Boarding was a little chaotic. There was no priority  of First class passengers. Maybe the  flight was fully booked. Cabin crew  was very attentive  & efficient. Service  is excellent. BA does not have  the best first class product, but  their staff is the best in Europe. Food was  good and wine  list was superb. I had very  little 9 hours sleep before landing punctually at LHR. Looking forward to flying with them  back in January."
1.0,"Dublin to Heathrow. BA gets worse , worse and worse. Today was special though. As usual the did the standard in Dublin by calling the flight as boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasn’t - after a five minute walk from  our lounge it still hadn’t started. Again, as usual, Club food is  your choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad. Today as a special treat they hadn’t heated the  champagne for my row - so cold they really showed the nasty cheap ingredients. And finally they ran out of champagne-  now the only advantage left of club. "
1.0,"Welcome to New York. Aircraft was  severely dated, IFE poor, meal service  included no snacks, poor drinks service,  staff exceedingly unfriendly  to customer service  on the flight . Seats on  the aircraft which have not been  replaced are beyond threadbare and we’re  comparing a decade ago. The meal  service has taken a severe cut in recent years.  To top everything , the crew couldn’t even provide  a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest - embarrassing! When you tell BA about  your negative experience  BA waffle on  on how great  they are but  failed to resolve  your complaint - absolute waste of  money - don’t waste your money , BA -  you had far  better positive experiences on Ryanair."
7.0," New York to  London IFE was good and the  weather wasn’t bad. Drinks were served  during the flight.  As we landed  food and a  refund were handed . On the return trip when  I arrived at  JFK the queues were terrible. After we got through the queues, the gate staff announced the plane would  be delayed by one hour due to a  technical fault. Return flight was enjoyable but the plane  seemed very outdated . IFE screens were tiny. "
3.0,Budapest to Philadelphia via London. They changed my return flight by more  then 4 hours.  If I asked them to change back to a similar time they  declined even when a flight was there. Called back and got another agent who did it but changed business class to  economy Then they  denied me access to the business  class and also refuse to refund  my difference between the two classes. Wonder what they do with the  money The worst  business class I have flown. Never buy their premium class. Lounge in London is worse  then the free lounge an American Express card provides. What the heck  is wrong with  this
7.0,"London Heathrow to  Guang Kong on  the A380 a couple of weeks ago. I flew in Premium Economy, which was obtained through points. The  beds were comfy and felt quite spacious, however I  am quite a  large person. Glasses  and champagne/wine offered  upon arrival, and  their food was  quite good. The  passengers were polite.  Live entertainment was decent, I especially  like the ""Festive "" section, which  featured a variety  of holiday/Christmas movies.  It left and  landed on time. Having had several  similar experiences with  Qatar Airways in  the past, I was pleasantly surprised  with this flight."
1.0,"London to Montreal. Very bad service  for delayed luggage. For some reason  the person at  the heathrow send my suitcase under someone else's name  or to a different destination. I was flying from  Toronto to Montreal , my suitcase  was sent to Dublin. First guy , talked on  my phone, after  a week of no news at  least he told me that the suitcase was found  that was left  back at the  airport and no  other action was taken. Were they waiting for me to ask them  to send it  for something? In theory, he sent an email asking  that airport to  get my suitcase  from Montreal. But  after another week of no further news and website  updates saying suitcase is missing, I  had to call them again to find out that  the suitcase, was  found in Dublin.  A second email,  was sent to  get my suitcase  sent it to me. A couple of days after  that of course, with no news  from all from , I decided to call them  once again. This  morning my suitcase wasn't in Dublin, it was sent  by London Heathrow , they lost  luggage again at that airport. This guy, asked me to call them  on Monday morning  Montreal time, so I did. I  came back again  that Monday morning,  then after being  waiting 10 minutes  waiting for the  internet to connect  with his London , he asked me to go  to the website  and add description  of the items  in my suitcase, when I had  returned that same day I placed  the delayed luggage report. Don't they  keep all this info in file?. After telling him  what I did  that first day,  I then asked  me to call  them back in  time again. I'm tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase. No compensation was  sent to me,  except that I had to buy  food and some  more items that I already had in my suitcase.  Funny enough, this  happened in my  last destination and at the end  was my trip,  that they would  make my vacation  very miserable. I  know there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but  for no reason  they let you wondering and waiting  time to get  to yours. I  guess this whole experience would have  been much more satisfying if they  show some empathy  because instead of making me wait  and call them all the time,  i would have  received a call  / email from them every once  of a while  follow up with  me After this awful experience with their missing luggage department, I hardly  believe I will  use British Airways again."
1.0,"London to Houston. Executive gold club  refused to help me or keep us informed about  the case that did not get put on to  their flight they  simply missed another two days of  travelling at 6 possible flights per day. The staff were steadfastly of the opinion that  it is not  necessary because we  already received a card with 801 USD to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes,  however they were more interested in  us to go home and had ticked all the boxes at their end. Needless to  state that because  we are away  for Christmas & New Year we  only wear the basics for dinner another fact that  really made no impact nor was it of any  concern to gold club team. I  further explained that we could not attend dinner without  wearing proper attire  that is currently residing in the  suitcase that BA and baggage handlers  have deemed less than priority. Because we have been  sent 801 USD No phone calls can be made  to update us  as the website  states that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed  as being loaded onto today's flight.  While the suitcase  should go on  at minimum of  5 flights per  month including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight  that would have reunited the bag  to the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 USD in the first place The callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout  our ordeal has  ruined our holiday to the extent that we have  requested BA return  from home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves. The tag that  would have fallen off is of no concern as everyone is well aware the shell  inside the case has the bar code stickers on  it for that  particular reason so that you can track the items.  *"
1.0,"Las Vegas to  Dubai Absolutely horrendous !! We were board and then  had to sit on the plane  for over 2 hours (in high  altitude with no air conditioning -  BA passengers were  already sweating) before  our plane took . Kept saying it would be 10 mins and  left 15 mins.  3 hours odd later we finally  take off. Economy on BA is : Seats are uncomfortable, no space, can hardly get refreshments (the cabin  crew were offering  a warm tap  water food is ) To make  it worse, when we landed in London we had  ot sit on the plane for a further 30 mins because BA didn't have a  new arrivals gate. Due to all the delays, we  needed to run  past mad people to get from  Birmingham to Gatwick  on time for our onward flight with BA. Against all odds, we  landed their with  10 mins to spare (plane hadn't  landed yet) but they casually said  you were too  late and said  to have to fly the next day. Absolute joke, I won't be flying with BA  anymore when I  have a choice."
3.0,"Flew British Airways  to Dubai to  UK Heathrow. Overnight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes  late to a  very easy to navigate through T5. Unfortunately this was the only positive  feature of my flight. Flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment. B747 , beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated. The food was OK. The biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested. No smiles or even a ""welcome on board"" whilst walking down the aisle. On arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the  guests The service  provided by BA has significantly declined  during the past few years. Even the newer planes (B777 and B787) haven't got cabins that compete with  this market. Also, just like other budget airlines, you now have to pay to choose your seat. Very very disappointed that I didn't choose another carrier as there are loads to choose from on this route roughly for the same price."
1.0,"I was on a flight from New York JFK - Budapest via London Heathrow on 9th December The flight was delayed 6hrs, when I arrived to London I got information that my flight  into Budapest was cancelled due to heavy snow. That was on the 10th December. I  was there with  my few thousends other passengers from  BA nobody gave us any food, any water and the most important any information as to what we should do with our transfers flight and suitcase. After waiting 2-3 hrs for my suitcase I was struggling with cold at terminal 4. Someon from BA took us to terminal 5. Today is 12th December and I am still in London without any information about my baggage and transfer flight to Budapest. I paid myself for a  hotel and taxi because all other hotels BA  has are fully booked. This is  exactly what you  would expect from British national carrier airlines. Very poor website, nothing is  provided and for 3 days no call centre, they try to tranfer you from one number to another  with any sense."
1.0,"London Tokyo Narita  to London Heathrow with British Airways.  Was delayed by  two hours -  it is understandable  due to the  queues in the  terminal at the  airport The inflight ing was awful. It was good , only a  long haul journey.  Very limited selection  was very dated , Plus they kept stalling. The  staff were ok,  though a few seemed allergic to  food and seemed  tired We were  seated at the  beginning of the  journey and then  delayed until an  end towards the  end The food  was average and  I was very  good throughout the  flight As far  as I am  concerned on a  long haul flight , the services are to help  me feel as comfortable as possible . I don’t  remember being starved  being comfortable! Other  carriers offer snacks  throughout the journey.  Why can’t you?  You used to  get the best , now you’re . I won’t  be flying with  UK Airways again. </s>"
4.0,"I was quite  disappointed with my experience with British Airways. First of all, our flight  arrived two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in . However, the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food-vouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the  problem However, there was no information on connecting flights in LHR. Once on the plane, the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flying Ryanair or British Airways.  Operations were okay but nothing outstanding - same with the crew."
1.0,"Flew British Airways  to Pisa due to flight times  exceeding BA miles.  Really a poor  business class product. The seats were really tight. Staff  were ok, but seemed stressed. You had to pay  the food in  cash which is  the norm of BA and they predict other airlines  will follow suit.  Had to get a glass of water. Three requests and then it materialised and that  was for a young child. At check-in their automated  system failed so it was done  manually - thank goodness for carbon  offsets still employed  on BA. Overall BA is dramatically . Those who  buy BA miles  should exhaust them  to shift to other airlines. BA  are no longer UK's national airline.  the magic of  Nelson Cruz and Willie Walsh is  now working if  BA ever did. Avoid if you  like paying up  front rfor your . Loyalty does  NOT pay."
1.0,On to Toulouse.  BA Airways is  not longer a  fully service airline.  to compete with  Norwegian and Ryan Air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with M&S food. This is over-priced  and not that  expensive Secondly the  service was never complementary- it was  all in your  cabin price. This  is the case  with this flight to Toulouse. Next time go to  BA and get  a meal from  you and carry it on board. I asked for a glass of water. This came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle. At least  give people water - it is  the human right.  The seats too are tight and a rear toilet  in economy has been removed to maximise profits. In this flight there was no spare  water or toilet roll.  I was told by  my cabin crew when I asked about the new service level that  this may be in store for BA's comers -  pay for food in economy class for long haul flights. I hope  however this is  still true. The  only saving grace is a comprehensive  service and flight times are good.  The care and service has gone. Avoid BA if  I can. Consume your BA miles and shift to other full service carriers. They are  quicker and more responsive.
9.0,"Last flight out from London to  Dubai Lovely, friendly , Goats cheese  soup to start, fish pie for main, good selection , wines and  only 7 hrs  flight on way  home and even  better coming back!  It is a  great aircraft even if you do  want to climb over some feet  and get out, the window seats are very private. Flying this aircraft to Seychelles in May and really  look forward to it. Just waiting to try the new bedding now , catering. Just  shout out to  Virgin and BA are way ahead  on MH."
8.0,"Welcome to Rome.  Has been a  year since I 've flew on  BA and it  really has changed.  Even the terminal,  the aircraft, and  food are of  the same high  standards as before - the free  airport meals and  snacks have disappeared  and must now  been purchased. It  appears that BA  is slowly morphing into a low-cost  airline at least  in far as European destinations are ! Presumably, this 's due to  the competition from  Emirates and Ryanair  As well as  its CEO hailing  from Vueling. I  think it's only  natural given that  BA fare was  so cheap as  those other two  that BA flies  outside of LHR."
8.0,"London to Manchester. Hard to complain about a flight  that last 35 mins but I was hoping for a bacon sandwich to keep me going after coming off a long haul flight with a short connection. This flight used  too include complimentary tea/bacon sandwich until the much criticized  change to M&S inflight offerings and a hot sandwich isn't available anymore. All things considered, that is understandable."
8.0,"Getting to Seattle,  our seamless flight  service was on  time and little  could complain about.  Friendly and professional  and meal service fine, good comfort , additional space in premium economy  for the extra.  Food selection was  just a little limited. Bags slow , arrive at Seattle but don't  count that on ."
8.0,"Flying to London. Good experience all round and nothing  much to complain about. FA's efficient  and friendly, flight  arrived on time.  Food quality was average. Overall, believe the extra amount for premium economy  - although I had cashed in some miles to  justify the upgrade  was perhaps a false economy. Major complaint is BA's policy of charging  you book a seat - it's  very irritating and stressful, especially in premium economy upwards."
1.0,"London to Barcelona.  BA ground service  was really poor even thought I used premium counter (Sapphire status of OW).  I paid 22 pounds to get exit for myself and  My mom, however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak English. Staff could nt distinguish the Taiwan passport from the China passport and keep said that we need Visa to go to Spain. It took nearly 10 min for her to confirm with her manager and her attitude was really really bad. The worst staff I had  met. Although BA sold a very expensive ticket, however, even a cup of water you have to pay  on it. I 'll never choose this airline again."
3.0,"Flight to Edinburgh  from London was  the worst travel experience I have . I was  travelling with 2 seniors (+85 &  85 we requested  assistance and nobody  turned up at  any of the  gates neither departing nor arriving. We  then had to  wait for help.  This distance between  airports is far  far too much , for seniors. On our way  to London to  Glasgow it was  a nightmare. The  plane was delayed  and we got  in London about  1 hour late,  on top of  which we asked  the assistance to  bring the 2  elderly to the  boarding gate and  NO one seemed  to care. The  other seniors had  us walk all  this way. It 's not only  the walking, it  was the rush  we had, as  we had to  get trough immigration  and the next  group was living  there less than  24 hours. On  my way back  from Inverness to  Edinburgh another nightmare  and we requested  it in advance.  Once again there  is nobody waiting  for the seniors  at the gate.  Again we had  to beg for  aid and the  UK Airways staff  did not seem  the know or  care about this.  They said that  we called the  police and that  is all. We  said that we  are going to  leave the airplane  but the gates/ walking distance were  closed and no one seemed to care at all.  They were lucky  to asked a  gentleman who was  in one of  our buggy and  passers by and  would kindly accept  us take the  elderly to take  to bus area  between terminal 5  or 3 (in  Edinburgh and then  waiting for them  to be picked  up in terminal  6 and after  departure point. This  individual who is not British Airways  and provided a  good service. Summarizing  the only good  service we had  is with an  airline person that  just by chance  had asked and  he decided to  help us out.  There were another ! We did  an online check  online (24 before)  and we had  two seats already , 12D for  1 senior (isle)  & 18D (isle)  to the other . When we  went to the  airport in Inverness  airport the agent  assured us there  was not seat , even though  I had prove  of the boarding  pass was sent  an email showing  the seats. Then  the agent put  2 seniors almost  at the end of the airplane  and in the  middle seats. So  yet again, more  wait for them,  trying to get  to the seats,  then of course  had to get  into the washroom.  The luggage another  nightmare British Airways  of Inverness said that the luggage  goes directly to  them and that  it did not  want to pick  it up in  Edinburgh Surprise surprise!  They went through  customs and when  we got to  a counter for <mask> connection to <mask> they asked <mask> the luggage. <mask> They said <mask> had to <mask> it up <mask> going through <mask> There was no way to <mask> back to <mask> carousel, so we had to <mask> for the <mask> staff to <mask> somebody from <mask> Airways to <mask> us to <mask> carrusel and take the luggage. <mask> nightmare again!! <mask> another rush <mask> us to <mask> to the <mask> fligh. According <mask> Westhet agents <mask> said that British airways should <mask> had the <mask> for the <mask> and of <mask> pick the <mask> with them <mask> bring it <mask> the connection. <mask> can you <mask> from British <mask> If It <mask> even care about the passengers <mask> are seniors and requested assistance. <mask> can only <mask> Westjet staff <mask> provide the <mask> in Vancouver."
2.0,"London to Berlin Tegel return. It's becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between  UK Airways and the budget airlines. The only saving  grace is that I've never experienced any issues flying out of or into T5. Noticeable  budget cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also, BA have removed a toilet in economy  in their A319 fleet to make  room for seats  in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet,  unfortunately My flight to Berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight  so the flight attendants couldn't offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passengers weaving in and out of aisle seats.

2.0,"London London Heathrow  from Dubai. Arrived  at the new ""Wing"" at T5.  Very quick process  - into the  new lounge. I noticed (as before) the check in staff do not mention the Concorde lounge per se.  ""... straight through there sir and into the 1st  class lounge."" This option was rammed.  Quite pleased to  see that the Concorde lounge has  received a long  term make-over. It  helped a bit ... Had a  snack and a  half glasses of fizz - then made my way to terminal B. Friendly FA showed  me and wife  into our seats.  Was freshly cleaned.  Came back on  board 1st Class was full. Airborne I had dinner: Mezze to start  with was nice.  The chicken thingy  with mains - which was horrible.  Chicken and biscuits  at conclude. Wines were ok. The  suit (the new  one - is  still wearing well.  Was somewhat tired. Managed to get  some sleep on  a ""bed"" with  our usual duvet  and blankets. I  am a tall guy and need  some space. the Club World option  is horrendous. Very  pleased to confirm , Mr Alex Cruz (BAs CEO) has re-introduced flowers  to the 1st ! Readers will recall he cancelled  it last year  and save costs.  if Mr Cruz wants to save  money he should  getting rid of  the gas guzzlers 747-400s. So a full 1st cabin  should generate about  half of revenue. The flowers (for  the WCs) probably  run £8.00 -  but pleased to see the airline is still flying  and not gone bankrupt over the re-introduction of eight  dollars worth of  flowers per flight.  BA 1st product  was very mediocre  comparison with say Emirates. Some have said its ""sort a an upmarket  first class"". I'd agree with that. One would think, BA would want  a make a  positive impression on  their route -  or at least some high end  product ""Logic"" is  not something BA  needs to understand , given the high level of  poor reviews on  their site. Very disappointing."
3.0,"Flew British Airways  from Dubai to London Heathrow. Arrived at Dubai airport, checked in - and endured horrendous security. Not BAs fault. Walked miles to the ""new""  terminal It's a  nice set up. You walk through the Club option, with a considerable variation of food  and to a  private room with  the options of . Seating very  comfortable Made our way to the  gate Departed bang on time. Airbourne  - went for lunch straight away , after a  couple of G&Ts.  A lamb starter.  Light and tasteless. No other options.  Had the soup. Had a salad.  My beef mains was very good  but not exceptional  and no wow factor. Just nice. Red wine was OK - mid  price stuff at about £25 a  glass My wife was told the  beef was now ""unavailable"". My friend had beef and  as did I - when challenged  with this I 'm told -  only 3 beefs aboard! This flight  once again full  and had been for weeks. 14  and 3 beefs.  No joke. My wife had an Arab dish which  BA did not ! When it came to coffee, my friend, then  BA - had  no choice of  one My wife then had the  drink offered - only to have it more or  fewer demanded back by a pushy FA. Most BA  Airways staff are  great - this one was a PR disaster. Flight  stayed smooth all  the way home. Another sad experience from our national  airline Definitely not worth some of  those extreme prices posted for this route."
3.0,Flying British Airways  from Saint Lucia to London Gatwick.  Issues with other  passenger reviews: BA  service is severely  limited compared to  other Oneworld carrier’s  economy class. We  are not addressed  by name. Staff  felt rushed and  were proactive at  all had to  wait for anything  was required. Not all breakfast items  are available. Seat  comfort and comfort seriously under par.  We came to  my rubbish prior  to landing so  luggage remained on  a floor in  back of me.  Do not feel  BA valued customers.
8.0,Flew from London Heathrow to Belfast George Best Airport on BA1414. Boarding  very well controlled and the breakfast  being served onboard was very good. I was also impressed by the  prompt and efficient service. Arrived in Belfast ahead of  scheduled time. Overall very good flight and service.
2.0,"London to Miami.  UK Airways have  been so disappointing  and need to improve fast. They  booked a flight  the morning of a flight and  so I had  me buy a new flight. The compensation they offered  was £22.  On my most recent trip was to Miami which I had an expired ESTA but  Instead of letting me know they could put me  a flight for a small fee , let me buy a £1000  return flight. Then offered me a £112 refund when I phoned to complain. I am a BA member and must say the customer service  was atrocious, as a company it’s  all spiralling down."

Have flown this route a  couple of times with British Airways, but this was my first experience with the new Club World offerings (White Company bedding,  updated catering, refurbished 747 club world ). The new  offerings are excellent, particularly the catering. Both the presentation and the taste of the new food is a  real step above the previous Club  world catering offering and the new  get your starter and desert’ options  on the display trolley is a real nice touch.  Also new bedding makes the Club World bed much more comfortable to sleep on."
1.0,"Berlin to London City. I have never experienced such an unreliable, unprofessional airline, that is  very hard to contact. My flight kept being delayed for hours. After more than 4  weeks delay, there was no point for me to fly to London , as I had missed an  important meeting. I was told that I will get  my flight price refunded and also  given a compensation.  In a few  hours I call their customer support , ask about the refund. They  assure me that I will get  the refund within 7 days. After 4 weeks, I notice that they still haven't refunded  me It's very difficult to contact . The phone hotline is only  active until 5pm . They hide the contact form somewhere deep in their website. Once  I managed to send them a  message I only  got a reply a few days later telling me, that they can't reply to this case via email and that I should call. All  i want at  the point is  the get my deserved flight price  and I take  1 hour off  my work to  being able to call in their  flight opening times.  After being on  call for a while, it turns out, they made  some mistake and  did refund me the ticket within the next 48 . A very convenient mistake, to forget a 360€ refund and not be  allowed to look into this via an email inquiry. Only after I  ask what compensation I will get  after this, I  am offered 5000 Avios points. No thanks, with that level of unreliability and bad customer  service I will make sure to never fly British  Airways again. I make sure to tell all my  colleagues about this experience."
10.0,"Flew Funchal to London Gatwick. Just wanted to thank the staff on the aircraft for retrieving my game console, was a pleasure to fly  for a great airline like British Airways. I left  this console on the flight, once  i realised that I have left it behind I headed over to the help desk  that is located  at the baggage control area. The  attendants were friendly and happy to assist me, the gentlemen made a call and while this was happening the air hostess appeared with my console in hand.  It has really  made me appreciate flying with a high quality airline. Future flights to Madeira are most  likely going to be with British Airways."
2.0,"Flew Newcastle to San Francisco via London Heathrow with  UK Airways. One  mistake after another!  A flight from  Amsterdam boarded early but due to weather conditions in  Amsterdam we departed . We should have had a  four hour lay-over  before our connecting  plane but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure  from San Francisco  and were told at disembarkation that  we had been re-routed via Washington!  The booked flight  to San Francisco also departed late  and we sat in the lounge  as it push . We finally got on the Washington bound aircraft  which were again  late in order to allow late arriving passengers from  London to catch  the flight. The delay meant that the late departure  had then caught  itself in a computer problem at  Newark thus delaying the flight further. We eventually arrived in Washington twenty  hours before the  original connecting flight  but there was  an announcement over  the tannoy system  telling us to hurry up but  without physical help ? Obviously we missed the flight  and spent the  last hour (around  around 23.00) trying  and find help  at the check-in desk in a practically empty airport. United (acting on behalf of BA)  got us onto  a flight the following morning and  a BA staff  quickly found us  a hotel room  twenty minutes drive away. Ironically, the  airline personnel had  kept busy ensuring  both the passengers from Amsterdam that  originally caused the  delayed departure made  a connecting flight  but were therefore  never available to help us! We were also downgraded  from economy on the flight between Washington and San Francisco as business  flight was full. We eventually got  to San Francisco about 22 hours  before our scheduled  and BA offered no compensation for  both the time  lost or the  change in class. They did pay  for the taxi , the hotel  plus the cost of the pre-booked  ( unused) hotel  in San Francisco.  The airline blamed everything on circumstances  yet would not accept any responsibility.  Never a good  story at all and nobody really cares!"
5.0,"Manchester to London.  You were flying  business class and  had a fast track boarding, but  actually the fast track boarding queue  is longer than  our boarding queue! Then on the  plane it was the case of  the ends of  the plane on  opposite side of  the curtain, those  at the front  being offered a quick sandwich and  a drink those  who had to ! The short  line was on time, the leg rest in front of the plane  were exactly same  and at the  back except the  middle seat was blocked off! Though  it felt like  business class in  this plane, on  a ground pre flight it certainly  did not! BA needs to improve  how fast?"
1.0,"London to Athens. On the date  for the flight I received a text message and  an email saying  my flight is  late so I could check in  and carry on  bag for free, later on another  email saying that  flight will have  15 minute delay.  I was at  the airport almost  two plus hours  and Checked in  all the machines  but It couldn't allocate my seat number. Then a  kind airways assistant came and successfully  assigned me my boarding pass with  my seat number.  While at a  hotel I was checking the tv  feed every 5-10 minutes and it said delay 12:46. My flight was  scheduled for 12:00. At 11:45 I tried to pass through security but  the machine would  tell me to  change my boarding  pass and asked  me to seek assistance. The security officer told me , I lost  the flight because  my flight was  at 12:00 and suggested me to go to counter . Now at the counter C1 A lady told  her that the  flight was at  4 and I lost it. While  she was explaining  why the flight  might be delayed  she made phone calls and tried  to explain the  whole situation. Then  he told me to go through security because the  time code on my boarding pass  would be valid  for 2 minutes!  Ran straight to  security exit and  terminal was packed  by people sitting. Waited at the  exit for another almost hour and  all total the delay on arrival to Athens was  around 20mins."
1.0,"Very disappointing. I was scheduled on a British Airways flight to connect to a long haul flight at Heathrow and having  flew BA in the past it was very sad to see how  the service went  down this year.  Chips and drinks  to purchase, uninspired staff and delay on inbound flight. I would fly a low cost  airline instead, since  is exactly what BA now achieves. Many years ago  this was one of the european flagship carriers and  it was fun  too fly BA, now it's just another shrinking violet."
4.0,"It was really a no frills  economy class. This flight was part  return trip with  British Airways. Unfortunately,  flight London to Doha was operated by British Airways. The seat is cramped and really outdated compared to  the other major airlines. The IFE was really poor  with old screen  technology and poor  choice of options. The meal was not good related to the price  we have to  pay The FAs were really dull,  nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like FAs from other airlines. BA really need to refresh or renovate  its business class cabin. It might  represent excellent innovation back in mid 2000s but the industry has moved on."
3.0,"British Airways is seriously lacking in  some areas. Singapore to Sydney return in economy. Fly the route often, usually with Qantas  who are great. The flight out to Sydney is only 7.5 hours and over night - most people are looking to  extend their sleep. Especially those who have come from London. Cabin crew were surly, unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised. After departure they took almost three hours to get the dinner service over and done with  and turn off  all lights so people could get some rest. During the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get  some sleep. The food is very average also. Two hours before landing, they serve a pre landing breakfast  made of a  newspaper wrapped in plastic. No tea or coffee. The competition is too strong for this route. I would never use them ."
1.0,"London Heathrow to Basel. Boarding: There are now so many 'priority boarding' passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second-class citizens. (The new numbering  structure is likely to cement this impression further.) Since I was traveling on a 'low-price' ticket, I found myself seated right at the back of the airplane. Yes, BA appears intent on replicating England's class system!  On board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a French ATC strike. Obviously, this was not BA's fault, but no drinks, not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac. After take off, the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin.  Can BA offer heated sandwiches, further  slow down their BOB service even further, when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place, is beyond me. The no-cash  option further contributes to the snail-pace progress of the trolley. The trolley (and a cup of tea) was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes. End of service. Someone at the back quipped, 'So you opted for the  back seats, too!' Yes, BA is a joke, its attitude towards passengers (its customers) shameless and embarrassing. It wasn't until I had left the airport that I was able to get that cup of tea. Needless  the say, Eurowings and EasyJet do  it much better."
3.0,"Flight to London Heathrow. A bit  if a mixed bag. Boarding at Miami was conducted  successfully and the  aircraft departed on time, albeit that  some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back! So much for safety. Seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable  landing and subsequent aching back on arrival at Heathrow. Also my wife’s  laptop failed mid flight. Impossible to  gather information from  a flight deck.  These ageing 747’s really are in  serious need of  help The congealed  chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable,  and alternative pasta  dish was deemed  acceptable The minimal  food offering leaves  very lot to  become desired. The  one redeeming feature  were the excellent  hospitality provided by  a young enthusiastic cabin crew. They must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product  we have to support. Flight arrived early and luggage was delivered promptly."
1.0,"Chicago to Washington via London. British Airways has turned out to be the worst airline I have flown. Unfortunately I am forced to fly them often from PRG, if I  want to connect on their One World partner AA,  who I have Exec Plat status with. BA charges for everything, including water. PRG-LHR is on a small business class seat (same as in economy), dried up breakfast that was tasteless, flight attendants that could not care less and when I asked  their coffee told me they were landing soon (40 mins before landing) and that I should have thought of it earlier. London to Washington  was on a broken down 747, seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. Had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat. Food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips. Entertainment system has about 40  options compared to about 200 options on AA flights. Overall horrible experience. The extra added costs for flying over LHR and paying extra  tax is ridiculous. BA, what is it about your flights PRG-LHR, with your onboard luggage allowance only? They charge USD 100 for a checked in luggage even to Emerald partners?  Horrible food, aircraft, LHR and transfer experience. Good luck BA, will  cancel at all costs. Included a picture from the bathroom which was broken."
9.0,"With Town to  say I can  make a positive  report on our flight. From the moment we boarded,  flight crew were polite and efficient,  who provided a high-class service throughout. Seats 4E/F suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy, but they are the best for a couple. Glasses were kept topped-up even  after take-off. The menu provided four  choices of both  liquids and mains, and all the  meals were both  clean and well-cooked.  Back to cabin , it seems that staff are  increasingly being trained to prepare and  serve food with greater care, and  it really showed  during the flight.  The IFE screen was the usual low resolution with  the limited selection  of films. Still no WiFi, of course. Take-off and  landing was on schedule, and announcements  from the cockpit  maintained that typical air of friendly professionalism. An excellent flight, overall."
5.0,"Bangkok to London Heathrow. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to fly with BA on my recent trip to Europe, on this route BA has a daylight flight (I can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive  at your destination ), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a  great cabin and stylish service. The fare was also pretty good. In the end, I have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down  get along. My issues were the following. I purchased a ticket in  standard economy. The advertised seats on the BA Thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the LHR-BKK-LHR  flights have been refitted. The seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and I  had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. Come on ! Yes  - got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures , a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. But the seat is old, not that comfy, the IFE belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. Great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. I spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as I could not see squat. The seat itself  looked way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. It  was however A bit better out of LHR but still not that great. The meal  service was not good out of BKK. Bar service did not have peanuts or savory  food - just a napkin. Main  meal was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. No cheese nor crackers. Not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. I have to say it was better on the return  flight and will give you more  satisfaction in a  second Cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the J/C had a brand new a la carte service as well.  Cabin crew operating both legs  was great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. Out of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. The only false note was the meal pre-selection. You get served first  as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. You have to wait <mask> a very <mask> time. By then my meal was cold and i sent it back. They did <mask> it right away, but this <mask> clearly a waste of time. Pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. Pax with Special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not <mask> anyway. Other than that it was this time a decent meal. Having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. Not acceptable on such a long haul. Funny enough the <mask> feature three meals so why not on the LHR-BKK leg ?. <mask> could be so much better. They have a great force but way too many <mask> cutting left and right - and should have <mask> all their fleet at least 5 years ago. <mask> is clear to me the CEO is running BA to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later ."
2.0,"A 3 hour  delay at airport,  originally destined for  Amsterdam with arrival time of 21.35,  but rerouted to Venice, meaning bus transfer and arrival at 2.30am. We  passengers were informed , before boarding , of this change. I had planned to stay  that night with a friend who  were going to  meet me up  from the airport.  In such an unsociable hour of the morning, I  could no longer  with her. I  explained all this  to BA, who  told me that  a rep would  let me find  my hotel and  it would be : On arrival,  I was brusquely told by a  flight rep to  go online and  get my own ! After a  longer than 5  minute delay, my  phone had no  support life. I  am left to  call a fellow  on phone and  headed for the  closest motel near the airport -  minutes away from  anywhere I should  have been. It transpires BA knew  I had been  some problems in  early morning of  my flight - yet sent passengers  via email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. I  spent 5 hours  at Gatwick (when  I could have  gone on working). Also had I known, would have  had to get  onto an earlier flight or postpone  the journey. To  top it all, when all 150 passengers finally arrived  in the deserted  streets of Verona at 2.30 am - no taxis. BA had not  heard of contacting  any taxis informing  us of a  lack of tired  travellers Further wait. Not only had  I missed my  lovely reunion, to  my astonishment British  Travel has refused  to reimburse my hotel bill, stating  that they had  not all got  around to my . I hadn't  actually counted the extra taxi bills I incurred (£45)  – but I  did expect BA  would reimburse the  entire hotel as  another goodwill gesture.  Very impressed."
2.0,"Flew British Airways  via Madrid to  Liverpool Heathrow. An  airline full of  passengers We were  either asked to  carry our hand bag or, in  some cases, to leave it by  our aircraft and pick it up upon arrival. I must say I find this irritating, as I had one piece of  paper within the rules. Other people ? Those should be asked to do this. I  often felt as  though I were  in a low  class airline, which is sad to  see Short-haul with  them never again!"
7.0,"Tel Aviv to London. We arrived  at the airport  after a lot  less time due  to the stories of how long  it can take.  Those stories were  true although it is actually a  fairly efficient and  highly organised airport,  we just have  a thorough border  and immigration services  as well as  most passengers face  the security scanning  and hand luggage . There were  two priority options  available for First  class passengers, although  I suspect that  is more down to the airport  than British Airways. The lounge provided  was a third  tier one and  is the same  as business and  pleasure and isn’t  always acceptable. If  there was just  us then it  might be ‘fine I guess’ but  it is not  as much seating, the food offerings  are almost non existent and drinks  are limited. Even  the main coffee  shop was broken  so there was  nothing very complicated,  one with all instructions only in Hebrew. At the  gate there was  your usual ‘priority � queue as well as the  general queue. But  that priority queue  included all first  class club passengers  and well as  our Oneworld emerald,  silver and ruby  customers - which is a lot  of people! Whilst  this is nice  they offer a  seat to all  of those members,  it really should be another queue  of first and  the emerald as  this queue was  quite long. The  service on board  didnt start off  particularly well for  passengers as due to some confusion  with the crew  I got missed , when crew  were offering drinks amenity kits etc,  and after seeing  which one was  working and the  others were all  empty at the  desk I had  a go to  the galley and  apologise They were  extremely apologetic and  gave excellent service  throughout the rest  of the flight , those kind a mistakes really  can happen in first. The seat  is comfortable and  offered a reasonable  amount of privacy and storage space. Annoyingly the ife  seems to be  reserved for take  out and landing,  that limits how  far you can  do It was  using Thales entertainment system so the  music was reasonable , with a  very good selection of things to  eat The food and drinks on board were all  excellent including a delicious veal cheek  main course and  two wonderful wines  which went together  very well. Aside  from the hiccup  in the beginning,  the whole experience  at board felt  really attentive and  enjoyable It would have been nice to have been  spoken to by  phone which I  have had before  with BA and with other airlines,  all in business . On arrival  the priority bags  came out incredibly  quick and were  on the belt  when we got  on which was  great as immigration  have also been  extremely quick. Overall  it was a  pretty nice flight <mask> a solid <mask> and excellent <mask> let down <mask> by the ground service in <mask> I used <mask> and a <mask> voucher for <mask> flight so it worked out <mask> value for <mask>"
7.0,"London to Tel Aviv. Arrived at  JFK at about 5pm expecting it  to be very  quiet but check  into security felt like it was 10pm, very easy , quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow  the signs properly). We used galleries  airport lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor,  but they did later improve. The food offering on arrival was a  little sandwiches, soup and some dry . This wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. Drinks  served were good as always with British Airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality  for the one provided was really  quite appalling. In terms of seating, there was enough for all the  staff in there,  though it was  pretty busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like  a nice place, although better variety  of seating, including  a more comfortable  chairs would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. This  major failing was the staff in the lounge, which  were more similar to staff in  the factory canteen  then what you  get in competitors : Smiles are  important and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality,  staff walking around slightly like a  child seruptitiously clearing  your table without any interaction whatsoever  was just plain odd! The other  things which I find completely below  standard are the  toilets Whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc,  in general standard  in the toilet  room was more like a cheap gym locker room.  The regular Heathrow  airport toilets are far far nicer and to a  better quality. Whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas  were nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. On  board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of  the cabin. This meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. These seats are  perfect when travelling  with someone and as good as  the business offering  of any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. Unfortunately this  was an ancient  problem with the old ife, which is a completely  poor product in terms of resolution, selection and even  that fact that  some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! British Airways need to have an active  campaign to refurbish  & replace all of these aircraft, <mask> of story! <mask> the Thales system is showing <mask> age now, but this Rockwell <mask> one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! The cabin <mask> were slightly <mask> in terms of level of <mask> and experience. Some were clearly <mask> in sync with each other <mask> serving drinks <mask> meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and <mask> Others however <mask> absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a <mask> experience. Food and drinks on <mask> were actually quite good, although the on board service was not <mask> new club world one on this route yet. Overall it was <mask> very enjoyable <mask> and as I booked using Avios and a <mask> voucher it <mask> exceptional value for money. Having <mask> that, I <mask> have still <mask> it good <mask> even if <mask> cash."
6.0,"Kuala Lumpur to Madrid via London.  Our first time flying BA and I had very  low expectations. Fortunately, my experience was  pleasant as the  seats were generally  good and overall  it was good.  Customer service (KUL-LHR)  was brusque. Meal  is served not  long after take off and my  stomach was already  hungry as it was past midnight.  Someone had asked  how we could have it later , the reply  being a curt  reply and that they couldn't give  food to us later nor would they have any snacks to offer. So if we got hungry we 'll just have to wait more  than 8 hours  longer for the next meal. Luckily on the return route we had  the very courteous  airline crew who  asked politely. Both  planes appeared new  but the seats were wide enough for us. Some  customers complained about  the entertainment unit under the seats.  Something I didn't  notice though is  that the arm  rest couldn't be  moved up totally between the 2 seats so that  my child could lie across his seat and mine.  That armrest kind  of went up  at a max of 80 degree . The seat pockets were very small so there's  precious little that can kept inside. The toilets were  very clean but the toilet seat  just didn't work : They always  slid back down  as there was never seat liners. Food was below average."
5.0,Madrid to London Heathrow on a busy Monday evening  in November was  a entirely mixed affair. Boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. Boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. This resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. Some passengers were  poorly behaved and argued with the staff. Every single  toilet was occupied. This was quite  stressful on the staff. A trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain UK based TV personalities. This was in English only. The inflight service was very poor. I ordered a sandwich and a drink and had  my receipt chucked at me. Disembarkation was slow again due to the  massive amount of luggage. I regard this as a health and safety matter. British Airways is not what it was and  along this route  they are alternatives  and better service.
2.0,From British Airways from Bologna to  Liverpool Heathrow. We  arrived at Bologna  expecting to be  told at the  departure check in  that the plane had been overbooked and that we 'd have to wait until boarding  cleared before we would know if there was a  seat for us.  They were both  shocked and surprised since we had  attempted this return  journey several weeks earlier and had  been at the airport in good . The member  on staff dealing  to us was  extremely brusque and  abusive and the  only information that we were given  included a typed  statement setting out  this fact that  since we did not travel we  should be able to claim compensation.  For us this was not acceptable  since we had  not be in  Salt Lake District  that following day. We were eventually  helped onto the  plane but would  hardly have made  this if it  were not been  to a fellow  passenger who seemed  to know how to get around  the queues in  this situation. I  think that these  queues were only  seen on the  better known cut  rate airlines!
1.0,"The husband and  me booked our honeymoon to Italy  with American Airlines  and unknowingly routed  it to their  parent airlines, British Airways. We ran  ourselves into trouble  when we received  the email notice  that our flights have been changed  and we now had a 40  hour layover at London Heathrow and we would not  be in Rome  in the AM  we planned. We  agreed to give  it a shot ! We arrived  at BWI and discovered we were  flying on an  international flight and  we packed more  luggage than BA  will allow. (We  brought three checked bags instead of  one and British Airways only allows  1 checked bag  unless you pay close to $100  an additional). Luckily  2 gentlemen at  their counter checked  our bag at no charge. I  can say the  reverse for the  remainder of our trip. We found  that the flight  was full and  BA had not  reserved our seats  booked for a  3 hr flight , we had  two middle seats.  My neighbors on  this flight refused to swap seats, originally then after  some pity complaining  a lovely woman . We arrived  in London around  2 late of  afternoon and after  walking to the  airport terminal in  another attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were  forced to make  progress through security.  Our BA representative told us the  connecting flight was full and we 'd have to  stay until 5pm.  He again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon  seating reservations in  advance The BA representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight  and so we  got our ticket  - but were  unable to get into Rome for  dinner Upon our  returning flights, we  attempted three times  and reserve seats online via British  Airlines app and  email (learning from ), and the  app kept giving  up an error screen even though  the charge was  not on my  bank account. We  then had to  book an international  airline and pay $174 to ensure  we were able  ta sit next o each other  during the 8 am flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting  plane to London.  Once we arrived  at Rome to  London - we  are hit with  the $100 additional baggage fee (we  had tried to  get the representative  not to comp  the bag). Upon  landing at the  counter my ticket  got pinged for having an extra  charge that was  not paid for.  Fortunately we had  a receipt from paying 2 hrs . Otherwise I  doubt we would've  have to shell out $100 again.  we are crossing our fingers for  another safe trip  home as we  are again delayed  booking our flight from Rome to  Rome If you  fly British Airways prepare to be  nickel and dimed at every part of your journey.  :)"
8.0,"Flying British Airways , London Heathrow  to Johannesburg. Plane : T5 Satellite , so used B Galleries Lounge,  it was quiet  and pleasant. Efficient , seats 50J/K  on upper deck,  but provided good  ventilation despite proximity  from toilets. Mixed . FAs and  crew were young  yet enthusiastic. In-flight  is good, with  one notable improvement  to the quality  of food, i.e.,  being delivered individually  designed seats and  three courses not  inferior to a  standard IFE lagging  with that offered  by competitors, with  larger screens and  fewer movies. Breakfast  offered four hot options which were  better palatable than  breakfast Overall, a  good flight, although  passengers look forward to promised improvements  for 2018."
3.0,"London Heathrow to Brussels. I had to travel for a surgery that had to be done in Belgium. Going there the staff at check-in in were amazing, as I had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good  rate However coming back to London the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging. I got on the plane and asked if I could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as I  could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation. The first staff member at the  gate told me that I had to ask a member of staff  as to my  bag if no one could help then he will try to come. So that’s what I did, but the member of staff refused as she told me  why she wasn’t allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even after explaining the situation, she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. Luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end. I work in  retail and I know about customer service but very disappointed with my expirience coming back especially on the plane. I am very angry by this situation and next time I will think twice before choosing the  airport again."
3.0,"Flew London to San Francisco. British Airways provided a functional, disinterested service  during this ten  hours flight. We were given what  is necessary and certainly no more.  Waiting for five hours, not even a glass of water offered and  It was made clear that the staff were happy to do the  bare minimum and no more. If  you have to  work with British  you do, but  if you can  trust them then I would. In the interest of fairness I have  informed the customer service team at  British Airways of  our experience -  thus far I  had been ignored hence writing this ."
6.0,"London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon. I was flying my return leg back to Korea after a Christmas vacation. I had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and  I had no better experience on the return. To start with, i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault. Having not had my selection available on the outbound leg (in business class!) i wanted to ensure i had something for my return. I couldn't pre book and of course when  offered the meal by the cabin crew they had AGAIN run out of 50% of the available selections. Quite disgraceful. I  am also unable to check in on line, so i was ""directed"" by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work. Eventually  I made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class  checking in. The rest of the airport process after that was smooth. This time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin  in the window seat. This meant that I did not have to  step over somebody else feet and legs if I wanted to get  some of my  seat in flight. Of course I had to pay extra $'s for the seat selection in business class - a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a  premium cabin. The flight was uneventful.  In this occasion  I had a very warm crew for which I appreciated. Overall I still feel that  Delta is just  being cheap on it's product and this is not  the acceptable practice especially in a premium class. Frankly, even though they  have the cheaper ticket price by the time I  have paid extra for the seat  having not had  the meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier."
6.0,"From Incheon to  Birmingham Heathrow. This  is my first  time on BA  for many years.  As a Brit,  I was actually  look forward to  leaving them in  order to return  them for Christmas  on board the  shiny new B787. I was disappointed.  My fare I  paid on this  trip was relatively  fair value for  the J class  flight - in  my view. However,  it was extremely disappointing to see  that you have  to pay to  reserve your seat  in J class.  i do not  hear of and  would not ever  see another airline which charges you  for this and  most certainly do  not appreciate it. I was seated in row 1 by the window. My first experience  with this cabin  as a shock when I realised  it was looking straight into the  eyes of the  man sitting next to me. And  after that i had to step  over the legs  on the passenger  of row 2  could get into  or out from  his seat. The  tray table did  not sit straight  nor pulled out  of service. Even  in row 1,  from the time the cabin crew  came to take  my meal order  they were already  informing me that  some of the  food options had  now run out.  Which left me  with a Korean  person on a  flight on BA  when the majority  of the passengers  appeared to be non-Korean. Clearly something  off with the  crew ratios. They offer a serve  and snack bar  per flight. I  got to the  lounge at one  stop and there  was very little  action to take  menu wise -  it was mostly  cold drinks. It also seemed to  offer a fixed  flight time -  anything else i  did not appreciate  on business class  now days when  meal on demand  was a far  cheaper option for  booking The IFE  experience was nothing  better than average.  We found the overall selection somewhat  poor compared to  other carriers. The  price and product  choices left me  thinking that BA  is way behind  most carriers and  i concluded that  there would not  see a point  on flying with  it again on  any long haul  or in a  BA cabin."
2.0,"Flew Cape Town to London with  Royal Airways. It’s  impossible to think  about a good  thing about this ! On the outward journey I  was in an  aisle seat. Next door me was  somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat. The crew could have  bailed the poor  passengers out by offering an aisle , they made  the attempt. So three people suffered  in conditions for  three hours. The food is awful,  low quality and  the poor selection  in wines -  only Spanish wine with no choice,  and cabin was  not heated. It was the most  unpleasant flight I  had ever taken. Until my return flight - entertainment system was not working - ancient plane same miserable ... This airline  use to be good, now it is awful."
5.0,"Back to Bahrain 's world and  you certainly like  jet pack folk , a business class cabin in  this 2-4-2 configuration  that is out  to date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the  airlines of Qatar,  especially Etihad which  is far more . The plane was old along with a tired  cabin and dirty  wooden bathroom basins that had permanent  damage which need  replacing On this  flight good choice  in foods with  knowledgeable staff. Cost uming was in  question in the  only bag you get, the presentation  of food trays  and the personnel service had gone.  Nothing more akin  an economy, also a real negative point is your  leaving Heathrows newest  airport & guess what you are  getting to your  destinations by buses!  a shining example  in what is  meant to be  the modern airport.  This flight is  definitely not 5 star and a 3 star rating  is where this airline should sit.  I was delayed  15 mins & arrived 25 mins  late so not  really a good timekeeping record either.  It was poor  on old films  as they call  DVD releases, no where near on a par with Qatar Airways."
8.0,"London to Philadelphia.  I booked was an AMEX companion ticket so effectively family of 4 travelled for £2.5k in business class return so very good value. Positives  - B747 on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great IFE. Cabin quiet and crew amazingly helpful. T5 Lounge fine, flight on time. Bags off very quickly. Negatives - food on  both both legs wasn't great. Salad  served and main beef meal very  disappointing Pudding which  are normally the show stopper - not great. In previous years food been excellent. Return journey just the same - except  for the crew  each time being outstandingly helpful. We were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn't do enough to  assist The real test of the  product was on landing at LHR, we were walking  on the jetty and my 3 year old daughter  fell sick all over me. We were stood on  that jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us. They were amazing. They didn't  have to as they were done  for the day. BA are getting  too much stick at the moment - their hard product is fine if you are redeeming a companion ticket but not  if you are paying in excess of £15k. The crew lift this product to a much higher level."
2.0,"British Airways short  of Business Class is nothing more  than an economy  class seat and  its 31 inch  window with lounge  chairs and a  bar thrown in.  Why is it  worthwhile paying three  of the cost  as an economy ticket? BA recently  introduced Business Class  to domestic routes , as I  made a decent  income for booking  flights in advance,  wanted to try  this out. Checking  flights was efficient,  with the Galleries  & Lounge adequate  by comparison whatsoever  with Asian or  Far Eastern Airline . Priority boarding  when announced, did not make any  difference as economy  & business class passengers were in  the same queue , confused. Having  climbed into the cramped seat, I  got offered a  hand towel as  soon as I  laid down. I  cant decide whether  to be amused  nor embarrassed by  this new celebrity  airline safety video.  I was more  in the stars,  than listen to  their safety instructions. But I guess  there was something  else BA was  trying out. The  service on board  was surprisingly efficient  and swift. Soon  after take off,  a tasty snack  and bar service  with premium brands  is offered on  the one hour . The service  is good, considering  its one hour ! Despite a  size 767, 2x2x2 , the cabin  felt claustrophobic. To  some this was no different than  premium seating, with  almost no leg ! How can  it be branded  as Business Class?  Is the extra  costs justified to  the Club Europe?  Perhaps not."
1.0,"I requested Asian  style food both ways including my  connecting flight from Oakland to Gatwick on the 6th  June but I was very disappointed that my requirement  is not fulfilled.  I was  told that on my connection flight  they have to  lock up my  bag and then check it again  at Phoenix airport  before connection flight  which I never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers  then have to  clear security checks and board the flight. When I reached Phoenix first  security took long  lines to clear then luggage took time to come then I had to go on the different level to check in,  back down to go through security again to board my flight. On  my return flight  from Oakland to  Phoenix when I went to the check in luggage I was told  from the staff  behind the desk  of TSA will  check my lock to check through my luggage, so  please keep it unlocked.  I requested Asian vegetarian  breakfast but when I got my  last meal it  was cholesterol fat  free diet. When  I mentioned this to the staff who gave me this food she  said that’s what  they asked for but I said  but I didn’t  see on the  food label clearly  says 18A and my seat no . 18K so how is this my food. She still didn’t believe  so instead of apology she said  we have to  go back on  that matter to provide you food  or we might  still have spare  food to offer you. After 15 mins of wait once she serving  with the passengers she came to me and told me that if  I want I can offer you full English breakfast  I said but  this am vegetarian  she said I don’t have any other option. "
2.0,"Still continually disappointed by British Airways.  it seems they are now in  this race with Ryanair and easyJet  for become the  largest carrier in  Europe out of the UK. Flew Düsseldorf to London. Their lounge at DUS is closed  because their check-in staff doesn't know  me (she sent me up there).  We have a  reservation at JFK and I showed  her the boarding  number but she  cannot interline my bag to their partner AA and I had to  use it. Now,  not only do they not serve  the second meal on the 11-hour  journey LHR-LAX, but  what they want  is for a  packet of coca  coffee that they pay 15p for. Usually, you should always fly across  open ocean on a European carrier,  but with BOAC I recommend Finnair . American with their One World alliance. What is  their point?"
6.0,"London to Santiago.  Cabin crew generally  pleasant and friendly. Cabin a bit  more crumbs, nuts  and grime in : On the  journey home as  I took my seat I saw a bit of  plastic wrapper of the ear plugs  they give out  and seemed to  be been left  over from the  last flight - evidence that whoever  does the vacuum  cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough.  The alcoholic drinks  were all pleasant. The food was  very variable quality (as was the  drink none bad,  just a bit ), some good.  Many have commented  upon the somewhat  awkward seat arrangement  and I found  it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over  a sleeping, passenger's  and trying not to wake them up. The other problem with that configuration is the  computer screen has  only be stowed at take off  / landing which means you can't  touch it, as  one can in  flight when the  screen is on the back of  a seat in  front of you.  On both flights I found that my screen seemed  to be broken  and would not  be in position  so that I would have to  stare at it  on an angle.  We solved the  issue by stuffing  the rolled up  newspaper in the  bottom bit, but  still I had  to take it  off every time  I got out  of my seat.  Another problem with the configuration is  because the storage  area is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. And that adds to  my litter problem.  Once you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and  speakers or the paper ring around  the napkin, what  would you do  to it? Er, drop it on  the floor? I  usually manage to  do quite well, though the pillow  they are provided  with is very  expensive On the  way back they  handed me another  pillow when I  returned Another small  annoyance is that there is no  separate air conditioning  system for your  clothes and if you take off  your jacket, sweater  and whatever, the lack of storage  space means it has to go  in the overhead  bins if you have already filled up the little drawer. And I  do want to  sound a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is  a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories  like as ""comedy"",  comedy etc but no A-Z. All  and all, it 's an unpleasant  flight but I would advise BA,  if they were  correct in my  case that they  need to clean the planes more  thoroughly and more  frequently and re-think the seat configuration."
3.0,"Back to New York JFK in club world. After  my very mixed  flight here, I also saw that  BA were upgrading standards on flights  from NYC in  2015 and was looking forward to  the flight. Should n have been so optimistic, as  it is still  the business class  and belongs in  late 1980's. Aircraft  are tatty to be polite about : worn carpets, seat with various malfunctioning or broken  and washrooms grimy  as the word , Staff tried  best to offer  the modicum of good service, but  their so called food improvements were  really not much better than other  lower economy cabins I have flown  where I have  still pay for  my ticket. BA talk a lot about their premium standards, but even  when you pay  less for business  travel the standards are well below  even their US counterparts. Complete rip-off  sums it up."
1.0,"My wife and  i booked two  short trip business  Class air tickets  connecting Johannesburg to Victoria Falls with  British Airways /  Via It turned out that our business class seats  were not any  differently from the seats in the economy class: they  were exactly the  same width and . Actually, British  Airways simply separated  our seats in  the front from  any rest of  the aircraft cabin  like a curtain,  they called this  flight business class!  So our pre-flight  meals were not  even better than  that of the  business class passengers because British Airways  had not even  offer a lodge  for business class  seats in Victoria ! Yes, during  our flight we  got served sparkling  wine and snacks, but does this difference substantiate my  request for two  round trip tickets  - rather than  one which would  have been the  price of the  economy class tickets?"
1.0,"Welcome to Mumbai.  All electrics at  my seat were  not working. This  should have been  fixed but the  voice control that  had completely broken  and loose   wires etc. -  My call button  that kept coming  on and off  by its own.  it was impossible for me to  control this and  at the time  when I did  NOT want to  leave the flight . I had  instead use my  own remote control  or do so.  - Because the connection was loose  in my remote,  this meant that things were changing  on my TV  remote without me  be able to  do it e.g.  i would press play on the  remote then the  video would pause  then start rewinding without me doing . Because my  wireless controller was  broke it would nt return properly  and the socket  also kept 'pinging'  itself out. This  was  annoying  as you are  trying to relax  at your seat.  The TV screen  became  faulty.  The usual 'push  or release' button  would not work,  I had to  hold the button  and then just  try to 'pull'  your screen, it  felt very tough.  In the cabin  we could not  hold it properly.  The footrest was  really stiff and  impossible to manoeuvre  of my own  and my husband  offered to help  every time I  needed to move . My husbands  charger was   broken - The  power socket at  the seat did  NOT work, so  I could not  recharge my phone  or laptop for  an entire flight.  The husbands charging  cord also did  not work. the  cabin attendant told  him that this  was an issue  in some of  the other seats  in our row.  This is not  specific to my  experience however the  power unit above  the seat/row kept  opening throughout the  trip The attendant  had shut it  and then it  would  open,  which happened during  check off and  on as well , throughout the  flight  For  my level of  economy and Club  seat seat, it 's not acceptable  that you should  need to rely  upon your personal  computer  This  particular flight was  the first time  where I have  flown business class.  I have spent  tens of thousands  of pounds on  an American Express  ticket to earn  our points required , to generate  the companion voucher,  enabling us to  being able to  book business class  during our honeymoon.  Whilst the outbound  trip was great,  it was very  disappointed with the return flight and  frustrated by the  poor quality of  our seat. The  attendant tried to  set my screen  which made no  sense and in  India the situation  got worse. Once  I had tried  the turn on  a screen and  reset it the  screen had attempted  a re-set; after  that the screen just kept flicking  off and off  on the remaining <mask> hrs of <mask> flight. As <mask> can imagine, <mask> is very <mask> to have <mask> screen flick <mask> and off <mask> no way <mask> controlling it. <mask> was impossible <mask> turn the <mask> off completely."
1.0,"I travelled to Johannesburg from London Heathrow on Sunday 22nd October on flight BA55 and  my husband was meant to travel with my two daughters on the  next flight on 23rd October. They were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot  go with a single parent to South Africa. There was no such  restriction on booking the tickets via BA's website and there was no notification of this  to the airline at any stage. The requirement is  not even on the front page of the embassy's website but well hidden under drop down menus. Usually when there are  requirements like for ESTA for entry into US, BA sends a prompt. However, there was nothing in this case. BA had on its system  and I (the other parent) had travelled BA already reach Johannesburg a  day before. The  ticket counter staff  of the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. Instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets. After being  sent the wrong email address first, when finally managed to get in  communication with customer  support they refused to refund the ticket cost, only  refund taxes 25% of total. The overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off-putting. They said they would use the complain to  change their processes but will not refund in excess  than GBP 2k in tickets as  they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs  after booking. Other airlines offer alternatives but here the attitude was extremely  hostile even though both my husband and I are  international travellers and have Silver cards  through their Executive program. I will avoid travelling BA  again for work  after this event.  Having received better treatment from low cost airlines in the past."
1.0,"Heathrow to Lyon.  Absolutely worst customer service I have ever experienced! I arrived at the airport a good 2 hours before the flight only  the be told that the flight is overbooked and that I could  NOT check in. After a long  wait to ascertain if anyone will not be turning  around I was told I can go on a  later flight - the problem being that the only available flight was the one going out the following morning. So I missed a whole day's business meeting  & was forced to do the round trip home and back to  the airport in  a matter of one day. When I queried the fact that I was unable to board I was told that overselling the flight was normal - ""all airlines do it"". The fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanation. I was casually advised to read the small print in the future. On the way back from  another destination, in order to avoid  that same thing happening, I decided  a check in online 24 hours before. However, I was again denied a check in and was put  at a stand by. Apparently, the return flight is  booked again! I do not understand how it is possible that the product/service that I have purchased, I can not use. How can it be legal that  this company has no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service  which I have duly purchased a  service 4 months in advance!!!! The disregard for its customers and the sheer arrogance of  the huge, inept company is beyond ! On top of that, the company's decision to  no longer serve coffee/tea and food on board is unacceptable. The BA has made a foolish decision to behave like a budget airline but  also keep charging premium prices. I  absolutely will never travel the BA  flights again!"
1.0,"Absolutely appalling service  by BA! I  requested seats with  more leg room  from a BA  flight to ensure  we was getting  those seats we  needed On arrival  to the aircraft  we did not  get those seats,  the return flight  did the same.  After I applied  with a refund,  After a lot of back and  talks with BA  I started paying  BA back, in  bits and drabs, not the full  price - so , I have  received half of  that amount owed! I traveled 6  weeks ago -  we have called a dozen times,  emailed and filled  in forms and  The last I  knew was that someone would contact  BA and would  sort this matter  up - no  one has called back in 2  days now. When  you call they  say “you can’t  travel anymore, You  need to await  for someone to  help you” BA  they are a  mess I have  stayed patient and  should have done . Worst airline  I have ever  had to deal ."
1.0,"Coming to London : It was  the first time  working with British  Airways and to  be very honest,  it is my  best time ever  travelling with them.  I had a  great experience going  to my destination  as well as  getting back from  that destination. "
5.0,"Heathrow to Barcelona. Reliable. No longer  feels like travelling with a premium . Very functional, but unfortunately at a cost. Flight  took off late,  checked luggage for  one passenger needed to be off , however arrived on time in Barcelona. Excellent information from the flight deck. Cabin crew  rushed and lacked personality. Enough has already been said about charges for  food and drink. Overall falling well  behind the standards of the competition.  A pity really."
2.0,"Singapore to London.  Customer feedback seems to mirror many  BA users here - BA standards  is just getting worse and worse, and I am talking about business  class which I thought they would maintain? The cabin  carpet was worn and quite grubby,  the seats terrible  and now must  have one of the poorest for  short haul business ? The meal  service presentation is  clearly a joke,  but on my  recent long haul  European trip I got better food in Lufthansa premium economy. Cabin staff  seem quite friendly  - they do  complain in the  air a lot. Chatted to one  with them who  like so many  people are complaining and even deserting BA because of  this fall in  standard - I'm  not surprised and  I for one  to not use them again for long haul. Time for senior management changes, as the  new CEO clearly has no clue  how to run what was once a premium airline. Now, they do little more than  fly low-cost and easyjet for one is far superior and nicer for short hops in Europe."
8.0,"British Airways appear to be taking positive steps to lift their game. The service on  our flight was flight was materially better than that previously experienced. The  level of the food served had lifted materially. The staff were helpful.  A big downside is that Club  seat sets remains stock standard economy  flight - with the middle seat  taken off. The pitch is tight , too tight in my view.  Another couple of centimetres would be  acceptable Overall, a better BA experience."
2.0,"Back to Dubai. This is a  taste of what  to expect from  British Airways .  If they continue  their treat passengers  this way I can see the  company very quickly  running into difficulty. The reply I  got from the  airlines below just  throws all the  concerns I raised  under the carpet. Living in Egypt  almost 10 years  and became I  regular flyer with . If I  tried to change the date of  flight with them  BA only charged  about £60. BA want to charge  me over £500  and because I  decided to cancel  the flight and go with a  different airline they  are only prepared  for give me a £9.50 refund  even though I would have given  them over 2 months notice. This airline is on  their black list, makes me ashamed to think this  about my national  carrier but never  again will I book another flight  with BA. There was no priority seat booking unless I paid another  fee extra. There  were no priority  when I booked  for 23D but  it was mysteriously  switched at check  out to 24E.  BA emailed me  they confirm a change in the  booking but did  however say what  that change was.  We did not  make any changes.  My premium economy  seat was wedged in like a  log in a  plane that is only 1"" wider than economy with  very few inches extra leg room. Is this some  sort of joke?  They had to  constantly check that  I wasn't in  line as there 's only one  leg difference in  each row. The  complimentary chicken meal  was diabolical. The  indicator light over  the bulkhead luggage  compartment was jammed  on and would  not go out  and no sleep whatsoever. I really  could not see  any necessity for  the light anyhow  as the non  screen lights and  a screen light give emit sufficient light anyway. I  end up paying  much extra for  it and am  extremely disappointed with  the flight. A  couple days previously  we flew premium Economy with Virgin  for return from  London and the  relationship between BA  & Virgin is  worlds apart."
3.0,"Taking British Airways from Tokyo Haneda  to London Heathrow.  It is one  for the worst  journeys I have ever had. The  seats were so  heavy that I felt every movement  of the passangers  behind me, especially the guy in . Really old entertainment system and my friend next  with me was  using the audio outlet! Food was also horrible."
3.0,"Back to Toronto.  Well now it  is nothing new  in that the CEOs very aggressive cost cutting, affected  all classes including  Commercial & Business  class called “Club "" does not deserve it name, because it is  so appalling! Again it is on  average cost of  each customer and eventually on the  staff who have  too work harder,  because there are smaller teams.  It is not surprising that BA B ranking bounced  back to 40th  and 26th (in ). Fact is  why this airlines  which prefers rather to invest its  resources in flashy  new commercial rather than in its  business does clearly not deserve to  have recommended. Once a grand airline, today just another  1 star airline like there are  too many."
5.0,"New York to London Heathrow.   Economy class check in at T7 , JFK was  extremely polite staff  with better service  then those at Heathrow. The Concorde  lounge is just  every few metres  behind security.  It is nice  enough with a  wide range of  shopping and dining , but washroom / shower facilities  were downmarket. Selected  from couple of a la carte  breakfast choices and  they were nicely  prepared and tasty. Boarding was reasonably  priced  and  everyone onboard offered  free boarding drinks,  food etc. Delay  of about 30  mins on departure , made up during the flight. I opted to  sleep straight after  lift off,   as comfort is  nice if a  bit narrow.  90 minutes before  boarding I had  some fruits and  veggies for breakfast,   accompanied by  very good coffee.   I only  got minimal service ,  the  staff were courteous  & efficient,   and they are  one of very  few good things left after BA , their CEO  appears to have  managed to alienate  the customers of 40 years!   Checking into T5  from Heathrow,  B satellite at 0515 was absolute  mayhem and a  sign I would  take another airline  on this route. We wanted for 4 satellite trains  all pass by  in full before we could even  get to the  Central Terminal -  disappointing to find Immigration in total,  just disorganised chaos.  I buy and pay for my own tickets,   and do feel  the BA is now grossly overpriced  for standards they provide. Please get a CEO that  chooses quality over  price"
1.0,"Back to Marrakech,  BA cabin crew  was lazy and rude, refusing to sell a pack  or sweets which would have not  required more than  10 seconds .  During the duration  for half of  this flight they  are in the  back having a  break during which  their service stopped.  Half way through the flight we  requested some sweets  from the food menu. The lady  we passed said , they will  go back once  she had finished serving some other . After 30  minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and one  of the staff  returned to rudely  say that they  were finished serving other customers even  when none of  the 3 staff  member was seen  helping anyone. We waited 20 minutes , pressing the  call again which  were ignored. After  waiting 10 Minutes  my partner went to the back of the cabin  and order the  package of sweets  but the cabin  crew explained that  they are having  their break now  but that they  stop serving. We  tried for over 1 hour to  order some Jaffa  Chips which would  have taken less  that 30 seconds , it was  too much to ask for. Ryanair or EasyJet Service  is luxury compared to the service of this cabin  and I will  only use BA  and if I  can avoid it  but cannot recommend this airline ."
8.0,"Today was my  second time flying  for British Airways  to Los Angeles  and London Heathrow. I was able  and secure a window seat for myself (without paying  a fee) during online check-in 24  hour prior to . The baggage drop-off experience at  LA and LHR  is smooth. At LAX, the BA staff tags your  checked bags, at  JFK you have  to do it ). The on-board  entertainment was good.  This was my  third time sitting  in the upper-deck  Boeing A380 (which had a special  overhead bin by  a window armrest).  Food options were consistent with what you find on  many transatlantic flights (Chicken or Pasta). There was no WiFi, but BA  provided a good  variety of movies.  I enjoyed BA's  complimentary ""movie snack""  as well. The ""Flight Map / "" wasn't working  during one segment,  this was a  little surprising. Overall,  we had a  good experience and  will consider flying  for BA again."
7.0,"Flight to Cagliari  seemed to be  a rather pleasant  but well organised . The website  is easy to  navigate and very  soon I checked-in  quickly and simply  had to drop  off my bag.  It arrived very  late for the  departure and noted  that there was  not a queue . The boarding  procedure was quick , efficient and  my interior of  my aircraft was  spacious My seat  was comfortable for  a short flight.  The captain made  pleasant and informative  speeches and the  flight crew I  could see worked  very hard and  were pleasant. The  food made use  fluent Italian and  seemed cheerful and  helpful My gripe  was the awful  selection of Marks and Spencer food.  It has to  have purchased and  a good few  things were not ! There were  no route maps , no entertainment . The lavatory  appeared clean. Disembarkation  time managed well."
1.0,"Shanghai to Tampa  to Heathrow/Gatwick. We received deplorable customer service recently from British Airways. I purchased business class  seats on 11/28/2016 for flights on September 30, 2017. I purchased two tickets for a total of $9,676.26 plus an additional $652 for seat assignments. The problems occurred on our return flights. We were booked October 17, 2017 on  flights Shanghai to LHR  London with continuing service, October 18, 2017 from London Gatwick)to Tampa. We were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of Shanghai on October 17, 2017. We checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 A.M. On the evening of October 16, , the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the  terminal as scheduled at 7:00 A.M. In the morning on October 17, the Captain announced , the Chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing  any ships to  depart After these announcements we frantically tried to contact British Airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 AM flight. We were unable to do so. We were informed that in order to exit China without a visa, we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country.  None were aware of this requirement. We had not  registered for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. We knew that without a visa of valid flights  that we would be escorted to the local Chinese police station until  they could arrange flights out of the country. For obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. We were able to contact  a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not  connected as we  are at sea in Chin ). Our agent was  asked to contact British Airways and explain our situation. There was another flight that departed  Shanghai October 18, which was 13  hour 40 minutes after our original flight. That was Flt BA 160.  You were told here are your choices: 1. Pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, BA 160 and BA 2167 , even though we  would be able to make BA 2167 as it did not depart London (LGW) until 11:55 AM on October 18, 2017. 2. Pay an  additional $6,388 per  ticket for a total of $12,776 to keep our business class status on both flights. (We had already  charged $10,328.26 for these tickets). 3. Disembark the ship and take our <mask> with Chinese immigration. Option 2 was outrageous, Option <mask> frightening. We felt we had no choice but to choose Option 1. The travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at <mask> and request <mask> business class <mask> if they were available. When we checked in at PVG we asked if there were business class <mask> available. “Yes, several” was the response. We explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if <mask> could have those vacant seats. “Yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. Of course we refused to pay that amount. <mask> were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. While on board during that flight BA160, I went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. When we arrived in London we again asked to be seated <mask> our originally <mask> seats. Were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but I was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. Apparently British Airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense."
3.0,"On to Marrakech.  Was a well organised flight and fairly full in  business class. My  complaint is about the current food  situation This was  another fairly long  haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m  after which a  complimentary meal service  would be welcome  and desirable. After  a lot of  criticism from others  who have flown  there recently we  bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board  is very limited, especially as much  appeared to be already 'sold out'.  The biggest issue  is about the  care taken to  organise the food selling. It took  almost all of the flight time  for the crew  would work through  the plane to  fill every row even though I  know that about  quarter of passengers  had nothing. Of  late this led  into problems for  those wishing to  go to the  toilets at the rear when food  sales starts at  up front, any  rows from front to middle have no access to  their toilets after  the trolley has  emptied Passengers resorted  to using the  overhead toilets passing  into business class  this I assume was not welcomed by those passengers.  One overheard a  staff member saying  how they were  now going to  do free sales as they were  short of time.  That is ridiculous  how this paid  very limited service  lasted so long.  I remember the  time when a  Bristol Midland crew  could serve a  fresh cooked breakfast with tea or  coffee to all  20 or so  passengers on a  flight to Middlesbrough  flight scheduled for 40 minutes or  that Aer Lingus  was serving hot  breakfast to all  over a turbulent  journey of 1 hr from Dublin to London. If  people want to  distinguish themselves from  low cost carriers then this is  not the way  you do it."
7.0,"Oakland to Heathrow , this flight  was fine. The  most that could  be said is  that there is no magic, that  all airlines manage  to provide. Left  and arrived on  a FA attentive  & professional. Food , and alcohol  were in generous ! My only real complaint was  how inflight entertainment was rather poor  with lots of  old films and TV programmes and  very mediocre choice  of music."
3.0,"On to Sofia.  All crew were  shocked This is the only positive  that British Airways are now becoming  equally bad as Ryanair! Onboard passengers  need to pay  large amount of  money even for  a small bottle of water. When  i booked my  flight from Heathrow  in Sofia, I  was told I  get a free checked in bag  with my baby . A day before my flight  we decided to double check this  so called their  customer service line , the guy  on the phone  informed me I  had to pay for checked in  bag if I  wanted one. I  told him that  there should be  one included for my baby daughter , he said this is not . I asked  him to double  checked this and  then said he  already did so  but had to  settle for a  separate bag (£30  each way) since  he already had my suitcase packed.  Next day, as I went to  do check in at Heathrow, I  am asked how  much bags do  they want to check in. I  replied how many  times am I allowed to check  out and the  man said I  can check in  three bags- one  with my baby  plus the one  that I’ve paid for the previous . The thing  was that I  just had one  bag since the guy on the phone told me  they can only  have one bag  unless I pay  for it first). After I arrived  to Sofia, I  rang British airways , explained everything, so they agreed  I should refund  any money they’ve charged me for  this additional bag.  I said they’ll  refund the £30  from the London-Sofia flight the same  amount and the other £30 fee for the Sofia-London route in about  one week time. A month later  i checked my  flight banking and  found they’ve only  refund £30 for  my outbound journey.  We rang them , they’ve said  we are sorry  but they’ll refund  that remaining £30  over the next  few days. When  they pointed that  they should be fair and reasonable  and I get  a 20% discount  down from my  regular flight price,  they said this is something British  Airways do not . "
4.0,"Singapore to Nassau  to Heathrow. British  Airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with. I will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from Heathrow to Singapore on Oct 23. There were bugs on the flight and I have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places. One can suffer the bad food,  drink / behavior of cabin staff but having one's health compromised is unacceptable. The toilets were filthy. I was in the paid premium seat (front row) and I could smell the toilet from there. The attitude of staff ranges  between sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason. The food is inconsistent and becomes  the pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available. While flying from Nassau to Heathrow, the dinner was fine but the breakfast (I think it was a morning snack), consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump, coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar.  I mean, you cant get a croissant right? The  flight entertainment was  poor at best  which remains much to be desired. The screens in  all Singapore- Heathrow sectors were ok to use but the Heathrow to Nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time. I could  hear the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the 'touch screen'; more like punch screen. The flights  ended mercifully on time and full marks for that this time. It could learn well from airlines like Singapore Airlines which are pretty consistent and clean. I am giving the airline 4 of 10 only for value for money."
4.0,"Flew London Heathrow to Madrid. British  airlines monopoly of the routes to Spain have a  direct impact on  flight quality. BA  owns Iberia so there’s no competition. Planes are the  core of the BA fleet, check-in  was a nightmare  as they operate  each other’s flight, but the online  checking in does not recognize each other’s booking references.  Bringing the worst of BA and Iberia worlds together."
2.0,"Welcome to Zurich.  Excellent budget airline  at premium prices.  as of late  no cancelled flights.  Charge for luggage,  meals and drinks.  Limited customer services even at Silver level. I have had flights cancelled  in the past  and after a  short time on  my phone offered  a alternative flight  from another airport.  Contact assistance for :"
7.0,"Bari to Gatwick.  Best of the  flight All held together by cockpit  - Follows my review of the  first leg a week back. Check in excellent, not BA staff and  arrival at Bari a breeze. Boarding  poorly organised. Cabin  crew chatting to  each other as I boarded and ignored me. This  seemed inexcusable. Flight  hours ahead of  me and good  communication from cockpit.  Never buy anything this time, smell of coffee far better than the  one from previous  leg Gatwick South unpleasant tho not  our fault. Endless staircases, broken escalator  & a long walk to security where half the e-gates were out of action. Baggage hadn’t arrived anyway , being priority so delay at security irrelevant. Had  to offer to  go to Club  for £89 - a joke as  the is no lounge at Bari  but the onboard value is a  minimum of £30.  I do still  like flying BA as much as I don’t Easy  fly Ryanair. But  upgrading to their levels will put BA out of  business for short . There is now little differentiator."
5.0,"Saturday morning 0710 , London Heathrow  from Gibraltar. Now  I know that British Airways have  stopped charging for food and drink on European flights  and their service levels are dropping so low that they are now  no better than Ryanair or Easyjet.  There might be M&S food, but  if you can't get any that  will not help.  we were seated  at the rear  of the cabin,  when BA started to charge I have noticed that there is only 1 food cart which started at  your front. Before there would have  be 2 with 1 at the front and 1  in the rear,  now by the time the cart get to you it is 1.5 hrs into the  flight and they  have run out of most things. This flight was  early morning and  BA had bacon rolls on the  tray which were  supposed to be  the best seller and it sells . Pros -  the cabin bag allow best in the business."
2.0,"Welcome to Gatwick. I fly this  route often as  I have a home in Tuscany. Believe me it  did not get  much better -  unless the option is Ryanair and  much worse. Flight  started in the new South Terminal . The decor  & layout of  this facility is : No problems  - although it's located in a  building so easy  enough to find.  Plane food was ghastly. Cheap baps with greasy bacon  with a dried up ""eggy"" thing.  I Didn't touch  this and those  who did -  got it as  evidenced by numerous plates with half  price baps. Had  my fruit salad and yoghurt plus  a G&T. Yes I know, bit early in the  afternoon Short walk  to the gate.  I left on  board the usual  aisle 3 for  economy seats in  Club Europe. The front row made it easier -  although only just.  Had a pleasant lunch of chicken  with couscous salad.  My plane was  getting old. This  is confirmed by the WC. Originally  the loo flush button was blue.  At 100,000 +  miles the blue , partly eroded  by finger presses,  became a grey  colour The loo  flush cannot be described here. Plane  arrived on time.  The Captain came  over and I  enjoyed a nice  talk with him.  A nice bloke.  The flight started  in the shared lounge. It okay  you can get  a Same plane  now (recognizable by the flush button in the loo , unless all  other BA319s are  on it). Skipped  my meal as  having eaten lunch in Pisa. It  was nice though.  A few gin  a tonics to suppress my irritation  with what a  terrible product Club Europe is. Great  ride back into  a setting sun.  Prices on all  flights were great.  But very low  fares to the  airlines mean cost cutting by the  new CEO, Mr  Brown who has  no idea on  where to run  the airline. I  once flew BA in 1980 and  saw a difference. Decline is sad  and depressing to see as verified by 80% of  flyers here be  the negative. Time  to find a  new CEO I  think"
1.0,"Las Vegas to London Heathrow. This particular Boeing 747-400 must have been one resurrected from  somewhere in the desert. The condition of this aircraft was appalling. The First Class cabin was literally falling apart with loose / yellowed bins, and filthy carpets.  The entertainment system was old and slow, and low definition. The Premium Economy cabin was directly behind First Class, and those passengers kept using the First Class . It didn't matter, because they were filthy. The dinner in First Class was inedible. British Airways are  hardly a national  carrier British Airways are at best  a three star airline, and maybe even a two star carrier compared  to their competitors."
9.0,"London City to Edinburgh. Flight left  London and arrived early. Impressed with the legroom on the Embraer 190 (much more comfortable  than BA's A320s). Check-in, security and boarding all went smoothly and quickly. Cabin crew were efficient. Light snack and drink provided on this short . Would fly with BA again  in short sectors,  and LCY is  an excellent airport to use."
7.0,"On to Gatwick.  Getting in was  easy at the  Air Europe desk and I was very quickly booked in. Fast track  boarding at the  gates wasn’t particularly well managed, although  we did get through quicker than  others would have  expected Disappointingly British  Airways do not  provide any lounge  seating at Faro,  although there is currently a lot  on construction taking  place in the main departure lounge, and the builders  are not exactly  happy with the  area There was no priority queue  for the entrance  to the gate and as usual British Airways did  their fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding  of the aircraft itself. The aircraft  has the new style, which I think is very  nice and nicely decorated (not budget y as some  would like to say), and whilst  its legroom isn’t  great I am  fairly tall and  feel quite comfortable and having the  additional table space makes it a more usable space. The cabin crew  was very friendly  & professional whilst  also being very efficient. A bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the  flight All of the cold parts  of the meal and the drinks  were excellent, sadly  my chicken main  being quite overcooked leading to dry  mouth and soggy . That being  said it tasted very nice. Arriving  to Gatwick was  a dream, especially  in a large airport. Although the  planes are quite old and not laid out as  neatly as newer  aircraft they have  did a fantastic  way at modernising  everything and making  things very quick. It took a  long while for  luggage to reach  a belt but  our bags all came out first  making the process  was fairly painless. I got a  great deal on  the flight so  i would say  it was reasonably good value for  cash although the experience in Faro  Airport does reduce  its premium feel ."
2.0,"New Angeles to  Birmingham Heathrow. The  home entertainment was  NOT working so  no tv, video,  internet or radio.  Camera socket not  functioning Headphones not  functioning Customer service very poor. Cabin  crew seemed to  remain unaware that  we were carrying  other passengers upon  leaving their jobs . Food mediocre.  there was no  apple juice or  apple juice on  a dinner trolley  and the cabin  attendant didn't bother  and fetch any.  Beef served with  tea was luke  warm and stewed.  no refreshments supplied unless collected from  a galley It  took 2 days  I get through  the customer relations,  most calls cutting  back after 18  months +, others  responding after going  through options. I  cannot recommend British  carriers who in  this case certainly  do not fly  and serve. The experience was far  below expectations and  is at the  low budget range  of customer service. As the British  flag carrier the  experience was shameful,  our last flight  on this airline."
2.0,"Malaga to Gatwick.  BA introduced new cabin baggage allowances. Ultimately that means everyone tries to  cram their huge  bags into the overhead lockers, resulting in a Ryanair-like  situation They now charge for food.  It would be fine if it  only take the  airline food trolley  for entire duration  for most short haul flights to get all the way down the  line On my  past three flights  on 'the new  airport we've been  delayed for over  an hour and a half (the last flight was actually over two  minutes without any ). As the economy passengers are not allowed to  use business class , there was  one long queue  for passengers stuck  with the trolley desperately trying to  go to the toilets at the  bottom of the  flight On the  far end of  the trolley a  whole bunch of  people waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off. The cabin crew seem genuinely fed up. One of the key reasons for  choosing BA was  their friendly cabin crew service. This  have now been absolutely and totally  destroyed by the company, giving them no time (or  effort by the look of it)  to be nice.  But if price  means everything make  what you check  first before you  spend any money  on BA. If price isn’t everything don’t fly BA."
3.0,"London Heathrow to  Thailand Was looking forward to eventually  going with British  Airlines after flying reguarly to Bangkok  using other airlines - how disappointed I was. A low budget product  at a premium price. I will  never again use  this airline, its the most costly  option (usually) for  a regular journey  in Thailand, but  still ranks the  cheapest of all  3 airlines I've used on this route in past 30 trips. Seatback  was so small  & of poor quality, service is  average seats are  locked with no powerpoints, no wifi  off board. Best  experience of the  journey was getting  home Absolutely shameful  from a national  airline of the UK. Lower your costs BA as you really are  lucky - go fly with any of the Gulf  carriers or a vast majority of  its best, BA  are nowhere near  good enough. Current  is almost a  dollar more than the other 2  direct flights (EVA  and Thai) to Bangkok and British Airways is only half as good as those."
7.0,"Welcome to Bari.  People who do  not care for ? Queued at  my bag drop.  At 3 desks  - one busy,  one with two staff talking, one  without staff looking  on screen. Barely  moved when it 's my turn,  they asked if  we checked in  the line. Cursory  offered at lounge.  Noticed by cabin  attendant on boarding - he pushed  for me to  return to ground ! Good on  a flight with  the impeccable pilot.  Got a coffee  or dreadful apparently  for coffee. Almost  never eye contact  to cabin crew.  There was a  good price."
10.0,"Malaga to Gatwick.  Our return trip  after holiday was equally pleasant. Check-in at Malaga was  a breeze although  airport was packed even though a  beautiful Sunday. VIP  Lounge at Malaga  used by BA and other airlines (apparently its the only one there)  are pretty useless  along with the  empty BA lounge that used to be there -  cost cutting ?? Guess we were  cheated by Gatwick !! Drink okay but limited, food pretty awful but  quite comfortable and it is very spacious. Flight left on time and again arrived half an hour early  - I guess  some help from  Queen Ophelia which I guess we were on the fringe of. In board catering and  kept up to  its usual quality and very pleasant  staff - chatted  up the First Officer, nice man. All in all  we were well  looked after in this Class so can't complain."
10.0,"Gatwick to Malaga.  Last flight with  friends from new home at South Terminal at London  Airport Upon arrival at check-in at 6:30 a.m was  a bit disappointed to see few  people available to deal with Business class passengers resulting in a 20  mins wait to sort out our bags. However, Fast Track through Customs was efficient and made up for  this earlier minor irritation. New lounge in South Terminal is spacious and  snacks and beverages up to the usual good quality, although sadly, the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the cracks. A319 to Malaga was uneventful and onboard food was well presented and of good quality. We arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule due  some fortunate winds so cannot complain. Overall flight quality  continues to be excellent."
1.0,"From Heathrow to  London Deliberate extortion  by BA in  My opinion. I  had an economy  flight return from  Birmingham to London  on BA. Days  after the outbound  i had to  cancel a change  of the outbound  flight and go  1 day earlier.  I ended up  booking a new  original outbound flight . BA app  said when i  wanted to change  and cancel just  my original outbound ! In the  end I received  the medsage that  a return flight  is ready for  flying in from . However app  finally gave up  and said I  have logged in  so many times.  Upon arrival at  BA I was  advised BA had  changed my return  flight as i had multiple bookings.  They said I  had to pay  over £350 to  buy a new  return ticket home,  only after I  described my situation.  I argued that  have I been  there that they  have cancelled my  tickets 5 days  earlier when they  said I could  have at least  found a cheaper . Even the  week before when  I got the  ticket in open  I would have  forced me to  pay cheaper. Eventually  BA customer relations  guy offered a  refund for £122  ( me again for taxes). As  i needed to  fly back and  there was no  time to go  to Gatwick for  my flight I  saw no choice  than to pay.  Time and conditions may well tell that flight will  be cancelled but  when I asked  this person how  often people he thinks read t&c  they said he  does not like  to comment. "
3.0,"Chicago to Orlando  - Worst ever  UK Business Class  flight  We  have experienced many  flights and many  different classes of travel over the  decades but this  most recent flight  showed the depths  in which British  airlines have descended (not the world’s  largest airline by ). We have  never liked BA’s  First Class (Club ?) seats since  we changed over  to the Yin-Yang  configuration of 8  rows across the  globe The seat  layout together with  the poor service,  and we can  now say this  was the worst  ever long-haul Business  Economy flight we  have experienced. To  THIS day I  have never understood  that from a  security and safety  perspective the CAA  have ever allowed  this seat configuration  from the first  time Unless you  have sat in  your aisle seat,  cabin crew have to reach over  to passengers to  deliver hot drinks/meals  which is just  impossible (True this  happens in other  economy classes as well but usually  in a less  awkward angle and  certainly not from  above your head!)  in order to  move out of  those centre seats  between E and  F and the  economy seats you  get to climb  into another passenger’s  lap if they have their foot rest down and  legs reclined. In the dimmed cabin  lights this is  dangerous and potentially  fatal as a  passenger you normally  ended up kicking  any passenger you  tried climbing over. We are both  able bodied but  far less mobile  so really struggle  to get out  from the aisle  from whatever reason.  I almost feel  uncomfortable in the  middle seats and  we are often  just ignored because  other cabin crew  just pass by  too often from  behind you so  in the time  I notice them,  we have gone.  We should not have to use  the call button  just to get  good service. The  second leg was  another night flight,  but service overall  was very poor,  the crew just  needed to turn  the lights down ASAP. The service  during breakfast was  also poor, the  meals were inconsistent.  My wife struggled  desperately to get  the orange juice  to her side  of the cabin,  so I at  times got that but struggled to  get a second  mug of coffee.  Our entertainment system  was archaic (very  little recent film ) the small  screen resolution was  very poor; this  aircraft was delivered  by BA in  late 1999 and  it shows its  flaws This flight  may have been  a few hundred  dollars cheaper than  usual but in  return we will  need the extra to get a  cheaper seat and  unfortunately BA are  still getting away with retaining these  economy seats versus  allowing access for  all because the  US passenger market  is letting them.  This is obvious  if your employer  was paying and  therefore you can  either choose to  take an economy  flight or one  if those dreadful <mask> class seats, <mask> will obviously <mask> the business <mask> seat and <mask> up with <mask> difficulties and <mask> service. It <mask> be marginally <mask> than being <mask> at the <mask> but that <mask> not make <mask> right. We <mask> probably never fly BA long-haul business class (Club <mask> again while <mask> are paying <mask> the tickets <mask> they stop <mask> so arrogant <mask> re-configure their <mask>"
2.0,"Coming to Abu jah I told  someone at check-in , I would  not interested in upgrading to Premium  Plus if a  new seat was . The lady  replied ""can I  check - you  are only interested  in upgrading if  there is a  seat I replied ."" After a  bit of phone  conversations the upgrade  was processed (I  spent 149 GBP).  My seat had  neither window or  seat at all  and that seat  was situated at  way back of  Premium Economy where  no toilets should ! When I  boarded I was told that seats  should not be  upgraded so I  have no complaint.  No refund offered,  some token gesture  but nothing. The  staff was nice , the seat  felt very comfortable. If it wasn't  of the rude  staff service I would fly again.  This was led  into believe I  could pay for  the window seat  but I paid in good faith. I've flown BA for years, but this year has  been disappointing. I  cannot fly with  BA again."
8.0,"Gatwick to Faro.  Really good flight all round, and  my ticket was  still in sale , car hire as well, it  turned out good ! Check in  point at south  landing is very  quick and I was checked in very quickly, with  fast track security  also quick. The  whole BA lounge is really well decorated and laid  up with lots  of nice and varied seating, interesting  light fixtures and  great views of  the tarmac. It  being early morning  but breakfast was  available which was  really good. Although the hot options  was just bacon  and omelette roll  and porridge which  is quite limited. Staff were all  friendly Boarding was quick, cabin crew  pleasant although no pre flight drink at all offered. This was an  old aircraft with the old style  seats but the aircraft was clean and didn’t show  any sign of  deterioration The seats  are comfortable enough,  the legroom is  pretty amazing. I  got lucky enough  too be in the front row  which had more  then most. The  airline breakfast was  also fairly good  we think, nothing world shattering but  nicely cooked and fairly good quality . Disembarkation was  pleasant enough, although  it took quite  the while. Priority  baggage didn’t seem to count for  very lot, and  unfortunately my priority  boarding tag had  come off and ended up being  part of the  first bags. Overall  a good flight."
3.0,"Jet to Madrid in economy class.  Easy booking and  was an expensive  flight to fly  to Heathrow. Online  checked in and  checked luggage to  carry in so  the process was  easy Boarding quite . Cabin was  awful - carpets,  doors and windows  were unpleasant and  i believe a  few set foot  in the earlier  flight Everything pay onboard if you  wish to eat  & drink, choice okay in brochure , the speed  of serving this  was awful. Staff  seems to have  no problems with  the card payments,  which became bad  attitude towards those  amongst us wanting  to buy. I  would have minded  having a cheap  flight but this  did not a  classic case of  a BA in . Will avoid  if possible."
1.0,"It was told  over the Saturday  morning my hand  bag was fine  ( right size)  by BA staff at Geneva airport - it was  also inspected. Then,  last Monday, I  was ordered to pay £65 (83 Francs). Staff at the airport were  incredibly rude (to be honest, the  staff particularly). Their  customer service is  simply awful. It's  the joke of an airline compared to competitors like Qatar. When filing a complaint, they did not respond for 3 weeks.  The only responded  when I chased them up, said  response time is  in 4 weeks. Can you believe that? The explanation  was their IT system failed in May 2017, an internal matter which  was clearly still  be resolved."
4.0,"From Cayman to  me I can't  comprehend is why  a flight that  takes up to  take 12 hours  of travel across  an Atlantic Ocean, only allows 1  hour in free  travel for economy class. Upon returning  home GCM from  Dubai on October  31 2017, I  decided to pay  extra for additional  flights  Particularly  for university students (such as myself) who migrate from such distances to achieve good education. . In addition , the disgusting  excuse for additional  baggage has BA  gone so cheap , they no longer provide a  complimentary travel toothbrush,  sunscreen & eye mask for 12  hours flights? That 's one of  the things I  dislike most about BA as it  make me feel  that I am truly disappointed with  them these days and whenever the  opportunity comes that another airline travels directly to LON  or GCM you guarantee I WILL  USE BA!"
2.0,"As to Paris  or London, after  traveling with them I have to  agree it's probably the worst airline I have been flying. When I boarded the plane,  you notice some  bags on the  seat and wall next to my. I assume for long distance flight  BA should provide  with a mask  for you to sleep, ear plugs, maybe a small tube of toothpaste.  Usually you have some headphones and that's all. With  British Airways, you can order some  free meals. I received my first  on callries meal  as expected but  I could not  eat the breakfast. One of the  flight crew asked me if I  wanted a special meal. The plane  is quite old. I tried BA, never again."
5.0,"Back to London  on the return  flight from our  previous BAs product was more like a 'posh' Ryanair style of product even down to  them asking for  discounts towards their  flight There were  very few noticeable differences on the  plane there was  some entertainment if  we were in a seat where you could view  the TV screen. On Ryanair, Easyjet , other low  cost airlines you  can pay using cash but no  with BA it  is card payment  made in sterling.  Our aircraft was clean and tidy  however overall the main BA product has gone downhill and the service  levels have slipped.  Between this flight  and my recent flights from London  and with BA , there is a vast standard  to the cabin  service standards."
2.0,"Back to Gatwick.  Thanks to adverse  conditions our return  flight was delayed  3 days. When  it did fly,  their cabin crew  was totally unaware  about the fact  and the passengers  have had a  stressful and frustrating . They were  completely unsympathetic and  had a chaotic  scene throughout the  journey The catering  staff was absymal,  limited choice of  the meal; hardly  any bar service  and no tea/coffee  and I suspect  because the aircraft  were empty from  landing they hadn't  properly loaded the  snacks & drinks ? In contrast  to the outgoing  flight this was  one flight to  be endured -  it shows what  little difference the  airlines can make."
10.0,"Back to Gatwick.  the staff that  looked after us  both out to Florida and home  were outstanding, on the way home  my seating had  been already arranged , my seat was separate from  my two children, I was really  stressed about flying home away from  two children, I spoke to the  flight supervisor who  kindly asked two passengers if they  should switch seats which they were  happy to do.  The seats were very good and  far back enough  that you were able to get  good sleep, the  main thing we weren’t to happy  on was the  seats but I  know you can’t have everything. All  in all I would book to  go with BA again and would highly recommend."
6.0,"Flight Leeds Bradford  Zurich Geneva via London Heathrow. British Airways certainly shocked me with the budget low cost style. My bag was 23.1 kg (0.1kg over the limit). This meant I had to pay for two bags whilst only having one. When  they asked to take one item  off and put it in my carry on to avoid paying an extra £25 or so, the answer was no, which was odd considering  the bag was on the belt right infront of  me On board  the aircraft boarding was prompt, a clean sleek cabin. I was seated near the back  nearest to the toilet, which wasn't a problem. Beverage  service was okay,  but was over priced, I bought a ginger ale for £2 and it was a  can which shocked me as it was advertised as a full size can. The only thing that was free on board was water, for an international service  on quite an expensive ticket it 's a little disappointing. The crew were friendly and helpful but I couldn't help but overhear the crews  conversation in the galley on descent into Switzerland. What they were talking about was inappropriate, especially how loud they were talking  about children nearby. Apart from those  issues the flight was on time, punctual and served  a purpose which I paid for."
6.0,"Los Angeles to Doha via London. Great staff, poor food and stupid  seat layout. I’m spoilt flying gulf airlines, but this time I tried  the rear facing  seat 4 of 345 configuration. Firstly, staring in the face of my  2 new best friends (seats facing forward) was at best weird, and at worst like a business class speed dating experience. Crew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked  to the foot rests of forward  facing passengers. Once  my security screens went up I felt like I was in some  type of flying  accident and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression I had died and was on a viewing. The  food was embarrassing bad - bigger  bowl of economy style food in bigger economy style  in BA, you have great crew  struggling to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering ."
2.0,"London Heathrow to Istanbul. British Airways  is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt  of its customers, even loyal ones who have status like myself. The overall feeling is  like an airline that is miserly  or skimping and  completely removed of  any image that  they try to portray of being  the premium airline.  Cabin South in  Istanbul is large, airy and well equipped and clean  and was not  very busy on  this Sunday I  visited Drinks are well stocked but  from the catering  department is evident this is an  organisation scraping to do the bare  essentials in what it offers - the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium  food Onboard it is similarly tired,  the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris  in the previous  flight and stains  in the tray table. Seating is cramped. The cabin  staff look dejected  and have low morale. Onboard experience the service is  quite different, than  with easyJet, in fact I would argue worse. There is no complimentary  and you are  treated to M&S , It is  not cheap and  not good value  nor any better  than LCC offerings. Service is slow  - took the  majority of 4.5 hours of the  journey - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet  thanks to the trolley blocking the  door - I  have even asked  to wait until  food was finished which is ludicrous given it took  my whole flight to serve people. The slow service is due to  the use of  cash only payment,  but also the fact the supplier  cannot allow their  own items to be on the trolley which means  a ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to  get items and further slowing it . On the return journey its  evident BA doesn't care about its European or non-North American routes -  our lounge was  the contract lounge  that was very  cramped in fact  there was dark , and furniture filthy, but least  my food was decent. Overall if  I wasn't for  this fact I flew with FF B and the low tax on redemptions within Europe, I would never  again pay the full cash fare for this airline  as you get better more efficient  experience on the likes of EasyJet now within Europe  and no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed."
7.0,"On to London , Premium Economy  and onto Oslo  in Economy. Easy  check in and  to the lounge  in 15 mins.  Our usual selection  including dry sandwiches,  and a chicken  & soup (minus  some chicken and  soup The lounge  was clean with  members of staff  chatting away. Efficient  wifi with sparking  hot drinks offered.  Fast departure, fast  food service and  breakfast before lights . There was  no breakfast (previously !) with the  coffee bar now  long gone. Early  with a short  stop for a  drink in the  Club Lounge, followed  with an ok . An early  departure and an  overnight flight on  the A319. Long  queue for the  flights (only one  was for all  of economy as  one other was  able to provide 2 more seats)  Very slow buy  on board service  but at least  one made it  into the last , mainly down  to little take  up of food  and drink. Early  on though a  long wait for  Air Oslo to  start on a  train was verging  on a farce,  a full flight,  no use of  our overheads delayed , whilst crew  scrambled for space.  Fast buy onboard  carried out quickly  for one and  saw the second  luggage machine dying  as the first  one served. Service  came to a  halt whilst the  crew tried to  get either machine  coming into life,  took out the  required visa slips,  put the cart  came in, re-appeared  20 mins later , service started  an hour into  the flight. Little  catch up as  BA had given  in including me as there was  still time left  for enjoy the  service The crew  tried really hard,  kept a brave  way on and kept going. The  quality and concept  for the BA  experience on board  was a disgrace.  Only a third  person provides the  cash and card  holders the choice,  the holding and the reliability of  the machines means  that service is  another farce.   We don't understand  how BA continue  the struggle with  the service as  all Ryanair and  low cost carriers  seemed to have  got to cracked  it and got  their act together.  Easy arrival and fast bags completed  our flight. Final  journey home to  Oslo was good,  The club lounge  in the B 380 remains quiet,  relaxed and an  option to relax  or eat/drink before  landing The 787 was towed to the gate 45  minutes before departure  and was never  ready to leave  in time. At  our gate, the  lounge was enhanced with an upgrade  to business class.  I was really  cold on boarding  we had to  settle for champagne,  with the underwhelming  selection of toiletries  or shades only  arrived after take  out We pushed back over 30  mins No signs  or life from  crew for another  20 mins, though ! positive enhancement was tray service <mask> drinks which <mask> more classy <mask> a cart. <mask> main of <mask> was excellent <mask> looked to be on new <mask> and plated <mask> cooking (no <mask> gravy or <mask> around the <mask> Afternoon tea <mask> underwhelming with <mask> scones and <mask> three sandwiches <mask> wrapped in <mask> Overall, the <mask> in service <mask> to have <mask> with some <mask> improvements. The <mask> on all <mask> flights were <mask> but lacking <mask> and experience. The desire to <mask> things by <mask> book results <mask> slow and <mask> service at <mask> Other than <mask> farce of <mask> on board, <mask> was pleased <mask> appeared to <mask> no further <mask> in service. <mask>"
6.0,"My early morning  flight from Gatwick to Malaga was  a very pleasant experience overall. The  plane departed on time and was  greeted by competent  staff amiable and very experienced cabin . Announcements were  helpful and friendly. However there was  a route map , many of  the snacks listed  on the Marks and Spencer to buy menu were  not available at  all I must  admit that the cost of the  flight was outrageous  but off putting."
4.0,"London to London. Slowest baggage drop  down I have ever experienced. I spent a whole  hour waiting to drop my bag  waiting for people who have already  signed in). I seriously do not  know how they can be so slow. People have already checked in,  I just need to leave a bag. The company really needs to look after their processes"
6.0,"A return British Airways flight from  Manchester to Sofia  was a service of 2 halves. The outboard leg  looked very good from London to  London the check in was swift  & efficient, boarding the flight was simple and quick.  The 2 bag on the flight policy was enforced and stowing bags on the plane was quick. Disembarking off the plane  seemed straight forward and easy. The flight was worth a good 8  instead of 10.  My return flight from Sofia to London was the opposite. Check in was slow and  very inefficient. There was no priority  ahead of the plane and it was a Ryanair type of scramble  on board the  flight The 2 bag on the  plane policy was not enforced so many people got on the flight with a roller bag, a rucksack  & then a small holdall! The  poor cabin crew had a nightmare  time trying to stow all the  baggage before take off. Once airborne the M&S service was sold out before halve of the economy cabin was served. With only drinks and crisps available towards the end. Finally  landing the plane was a slow and drawn out affair as passengers where trying to locate their 3 bags while holding up the isle.  Overall I would give this leg 4 out of 10."
1.0,"Welcome to London.  British Airways used  once be my favourite airline, however,  for the last  few years I  had experienced some  poor service in  just much every  flight I have  travelled with them. I do fly  to BA about  5 times a  year In this  latest occasion my  trip was cancelled  for apparent adverse  circumstances (this being  at the middle of summer in  a time where the weather was excellent in both  our departure/arrival cities)  I was told  about this the day before in  mid afternoon bearing  into mind I 'm flying at  in the morning ! Their communication  is made via  phone including a  suggestion to call  them to re  book my flight.  I must have  tried that number  over 30 times  with success as  both lines were  so busy. When  they managed to  ring I have  managed to hold for an hour  in the line , I have  finally managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they  informed me they  want me on  a flight 4.5 hours later. Horrible  airline service by  that way, the  person I was  talking to couldn't  complain less. I was originally flying  a business and  I was placed  on economy instead.  I was told  that there was no compensation for  my delay because  this was due  in the weather , (a lie of course as  the weather was  absolutely amazing in  both countries) and promised a refund  on the fare  that to date (about 4 months ) has still  never happened. If  I call them  to transfer your  seat to India where if you  were lucky you  have an hour  waiting to end  up speaking to  someone unable to help. What once  became the best airline is now  better than Ryanair.  Avoid if possible"
3.0,"They used to  offer a nice  service with great  customer service, those  queues are long . If you  are in their "" class"" you  can get what  you used to  receive in economy  10 years ago:  Same leg space, same food, same drinks. Forget about  a welcome drink  and take off,  main course dinner (was offered a  nice club sandwich  on my last  stop and personalized ). Economy class  is just like  Norwegian or Ryanair,  but you will  spend much less  than the latter . Shame."
3.0,"London Heathrow to New York. After reading reviews I was hoping some  would inaccurate, but after this flight  on Club World I realise that  quality has fallen even lower than many have said.  Check in at T5 was interminably slow with one  and the most arrogant staff I 've encountered for years. The lounge was crowded and dirty, and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility. Onboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and  offer no privacy whatsoever. The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me,  so what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standards. IFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poor. Cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly, but they certainly hide in the galley as soon  that they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these. Luckily, I am leaving the USA to Asia from Los Angeles next week on Eva Air and expecting a big step up in standards. "
9.0,"South of Spain  via Gatwick via  Santa Lucia was  another good experience.  We don't have  many complaints regarding  my seat quality  of flight attendants,  they did a  really good job  on the flight  in keeping the  flight safe and  providing meals and  snacks The seat  was comfortable enough,  little bit wider  and on low  cost flights, I  wanted extra space  but as I  thought the leg  space between seats was regular. I  had a seat  in the bulkhead  had enough leg room There was  another minor issue,  our flight had a stop at  St Lucia, after  that the new flight attendants insisted  upon waking up the people on  their front row,  through their entertainment  center screens, to  show them the  latest video which  had shown about  every hour and  a half on  take off from  Port of Spain.  We told them  was not necessary  they view the  footage again and  that the video  were not available  on time, so  that would be something the management  should look into. In-flight entertainment was  excellent with no  problems which pleased  me a lot.  They had a  female passenger next  the me in  my middle seat,  she had a  lot too much  to drink and  moved a lot in the seat,  he talked louder  when necessary, but  it was still fun to have  around and the  new attendants made  it in a  really polite and  efficient way that  sometimes does not  bother the other , There were  also issues during  boarding at the  new airport in  Port of Spain,  as BA staff  had to put  the priority tag  into my bag  or give me  the voucher for  their lounge as  they have a  BA card on  arrival To use  the lounge I  needed to use  a Priority Pass , to waste  time until the matter was cleared  on the ground  and I was  going further from  Barcelona to Istanbul  on Turkish Airlines,  normally I would  still have to  pass airports in  Europe and as  a result go  through immigration, take  my baggage out,  board again, pass  screening and security  again but BA  did have an  arrangement with Turkish  Airlines and I  refused to go  over this lengthy  process"
1.0,"From London Heathrow to Chicago. Simply . Aircraft was old configuration B-747-400 , Premium Economy  Class to First  Class Cabin was filthy, and carpets  ripped up. Food  is inedible. The  food system was  extremely slow, and  lacking resolution. No  one of course,  why British Airways  chief executives should  have forced to endure this awful  experience and sample  for themselves. For  them to call  them ""First Class""  are insulting, demeaning,  and arrogant in  an extreme. These  terrible aircraft need to be replaced  for the lovely A380, and the entire First Class  / Club Class  program should be  improved / enhanced.  But of course,  it will never  happen whilst this airline has a  complete monopoly across  the Atlantic. "
7.0,On to Gatwick.  We left on time and the plane was clean and modern. The  crew were friendly. The flight was  about 40 minutes and the crew worked hard to  help and serve  passengers who wanted to buy food  and drinks but  are not sure  we made it  on the final  destination I think the problem is  as there are only 2 staff  to service the economy cabin whereas  in our EasyJet flight out there  had been 4 staff (as there  were no business ) I still  cannot think the buy on board is working that  effectively but that  is not the  airlines fault. We were pleased to  be 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to  take a bus  to the terminal.  This BA offering is now on a par with  lower cost carriers and as we got a competitive  deal for this  flight we were fairly happy.
7.0,Return to Tirana.  First flight on  an outward and return journey. The  aircraft was adequate for a short  trip but only limited pitch. The aircraft was clean. Cabin crew were  friendly and friendly  throughout the journey  and busy selling food and on board goods. The main advantage of  the airline was  its direct flight  connecting UK to  Europe otherwise nothing special to recommend. Both flights on time.
4.0,I booked British Airways to travel  on the assumption  this was a quality carrier not a low cost carrier. I expected a meal and  coffee to be . I was  unaware of the  price changes and  therefore very disappointed  as I booked. This airline is no longer quality  with the prices  we charge. Expect a budget airline experience here. Staff  was very friendly and helpful however. Pilot also chatty throughout the flight giving us lots of info.
9.0,"Mal Lumpur to  Dubai via London.  The long haul  nice and clean,  short haul a  bit old, but  very acceptable. Crew  members are lovely,  great service. BA  crew is on  the top of  their rank. Kuala ala to London My boyfriend and I got beef  tacos and chicken  salad as dinner , beef omelette  for breakfast. Also  quite tasty. We  got 2 wines  for so many ! Return flight  with chicken curry  with pesto pasta.  Makes it flavorful.  And we got  a congee and  rice breakfast before  I landed. Short  flights don't have  much food. Inflight  is not the  best but still  good Short hauls don't have any ! Only thing I don't like  is the seats.  My seats are  comfortable I have  a problem with , since I  am a petite  person but still  really uncomfortable to  sit straight up.  But I knew  that I will  get a premium  because that one  is nicer and  with more space.  We got the  lowest price for  this trip, value  the money!"
10.0,Jet flew from Brussels to London  early on an . The aircraft  were about three quarters full. Boarding was smooth and we left and arrived slightly early. The sale of  sandwiches and drinks  goes well and  not appear to  have much of  our take up  as this flight  in less than  an hour. Crew  were good.
8.0,"We flew from London Heathrow to Sofia and back. The plane on both flights was an Airbus 321 and I’d guess a young one  just by the  look of the interior. I am 1.82m (6 feet)  short and found  both leg room and seat width  should be fine  - I certainly didn’t feel cramped even in the centre seat. Both flights departed the gate on schedule  but actual take-off  for the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of  the traffic restrictions over Europe). The  airline crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous. On both flights, the captain kept us very well informed of our  destinations and our  seats So far,  good marks to British Airways but  how they let  you down is the shambles of a refreshment service. It might seem  as a minor  inconvenience but I do like the opportunity to get something to eat  and drink on a flight even if I have to pay for it (which you do not on other legacy airlines  including Lufthansa). The range and prices of food and  beverages on offer were comparable with  low cost airlines I have flown with. But there  is comparison ends  because whilst I  had always been served quickly (and  sometimes twice) on short haul low-cost airlines, BA’s service  is too slow  and seems to  run out of  touch too. They also insist on  check only transactions. I had the  opportunity to be sitting toward the  rear of the plane on both legs - and  this A321 is  no long plane.  A single trolley  started from the front, making ponderous progress towards me  - even though the flight was  three hours and forty minutes long, I only just  managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight  crew who by  then had returned the trolley and was scuttling to  safety from the  back squeezing past  another long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories. (The coffee, by the way, was excellent). The return  journey was worse because the trolley  make it two  rows down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close  to me before  abruptly stopping and  returning to the  floor leaving the remaining passengers unserved. In conclusion, clean  but punctual service,  poor cabin crew  and awful refreshment service."
6.0,"Flight to Bilbao. Boarding of the  aircraft at Heathrow  was very good , the flight was on time  and the plane was clean. Frequent flyers boarded first  then the rest  passengers followed. From  then on the service was very  comparable to a  Delta Jet or  Emirates flight. The  airline crew member's  were economy passed  around the cabin selling M&S sandwiches , snacks and  drinks The flight out of Bilbao  got delayed by a late incoming  flight information on the delay was a little slow in coming from  the gate agent.  Nevertheless the crew  was very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed. The flight crew also managed  the shave 15 mins off the flight time too.  So the service onboard is similar to Eurowings. Both  flights were safe  and competent. But  in actual flight experience was lacking  and in future I will consider  Emirates or similar  as they offer the same level  of service for  less money."
5.0,"Flight to London  - No priority  food at Kalamata. Drink and food  are poorly synchronised,  so no pre-dinner ; no nuts,  and bread served  as main course.  The vegetarian special  was the same tomato and mozzarella  pasta as on  the outbound flight  despite a beetroot  pasta dish being available on the  same menu. The  vegan main was yet again a bland, overcooked pasta . Overall, a  disappointing vegetarian offering.  Flight crew did  a bare minimum in Club Europe  and their main  business seemed to  involve selling the M&S stuff in  toilets which they  kept doing up  until 30 minutes  after landing. The  Club Europe toilet was grubby. Flight  landed on schedule  but there was  a long wait  with baggage at  customs"
3.0,"London Heathrow to Krakow. I am a one world emerald member on  Emirates so I  get certain perks when flying British  Airways such as free seat selection,  lounge use and priority boarding -  this makes this airline bearable -  but They are obsessed with carry  over bags much  like Ryanair giving out silly yellow  bags for carry on bags and  other carry on  luggage - not sure what it  means for them  - it only  increases their bag handling costs. Their seats are no better than anyone else and their pitch just as tight. What used  too set BA apart was their  customer service - even in coach a sandwich or  coffee - this has degraded to nothing, zero -  even a soft drink is charged.  When I asked  a water, I  got offered an Evian for $5 - no thanks , plain water.  Yes sir we will come back  to you after  they serve everyone else. Of course he never came  in - 2.5  hr flight and  not even allowed a cup of  coffee BA are  rated as a 4 star airline,  but AA are  rated 3 star  and AA now have better inflight service than BA by a country  and BA are a bottom tier airline and nothing more to the  frequent flier."
3.0,"London Heathrow to Abuja, Nigeria with British Airways. Departed on time, paid extra for legroom seat aisle side of exit door, don'0t bother as  plane has no pocket for documents, glasses etc.. Seat  too narrow that you cannot move, seat cushion hard and old. Cabin crew comment, you have extra legroom arent you lucky ,my comment - yes and I  went for it when I asked about lack of pocket for my specs and passport. Food was bland. Arrived on time. Departing Abuja on return trip I had an aisle seat, again narrow and extremely uncomfortable. Old aircraft. Cost cutting squeeze in Economy will drive customers away as comparable airlines offer much more. Now  that number and particularly the dimensions of the toilets have been reduced you can hardly fit into the toilet. Food on return trip was a so called breakfast, yellow mass called an omelette  or some sort of potato fritter. Cabin crew went through the motions but seemed in a hurry to get service finished and to disappear. Return flight was on time. Punctuality was BAs saving grace."
2.0,"Welcome to Tokyo . Boeing 777 , tatty inside, cabin items (seats, carpets, tables etc)  dirty and dirty. Sticky surfaces, and  scary to think what germs are being stored here.  Quality standards are very poor compared to Lufthansa and ANA that I flew earlier this year, reflects the  BA move to  fly budget standard airline at premium prices. Cabin staff  are nice but even they cannot  make up for  the poor other areas have gotten  from BA. Time  to remove the  cheap airline minded  seats there now,  but surely Skytrax must now downgrade them to 3  stars at best? "
6.0,"London Heathrow to  Hong Kong. A  slightly mixed experience.  On the positive  the cabin crew  was professional and  our Cockpit announcements very informative. Flight  on time, with  need to catch  someone for a  bit at departure due to tech . In terms  a hard product,  it was a  little disappointed. The Premium economy cabin  looks clean and  spacious but the  seat is pretty  heavy and not  that comfortable for  the long night , Entertainment screen  is slow to  open (happened to  happen to with another A380 from BA so means it's an issue  for the hardware). Food is decent quality, but the  service at least  the PE, could 've improved. The  baggage delivery has  become a pain,  30 minutes from  the landing to  a delivery of  your bags is  pretty much, even for such a  large airplane."
1.0,Back to Alicante. Yesterdays flight was grim from the moment of arriving  at our boarding  gate and seeing two long lines  with a stag and a hen party in various stages of drunkenness. Not really the  kind you feel safe being in  a very confined space with and especially with a  young baby. The  mood and behaviour  grew even more threatening as the  luggage trolley ploughed up and down the aisle. Especially awful as we were confined to  our smallest seating  area possible. It was all truly  frightening and very disheartening as we  have driven for  weeks to avoid these conditions in  our aurlines. Previously we had had  the lot of respect for British Airways standards now thoroughly destroyed.
6.0,"From London Heathrow , Kalamata. Slow  flight on this new BA destination  in Greece. Club house seats uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight, particularly  as the seat  out front is  removed just before  the meal service.  Good IFE. Cabin  staff were professional and attentive throughout.  The service definitely  impressed although the  only main course  included the usual bland, overcooked pasta.  Service on schedule  and through to  ground hire within ten minutes of  boarding Overall, a reasonable flight, although  Continental Europe is  poor value by  a business class  flight"
4.0,"Gatwick to Mauritius.  A disappointing airline and service. The facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits, it's a mess. Why? Because you get other people stumbling on your feet  sometimes mid-flight. Or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old  people not flexible  enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid-sleep every time they need  to use the restroom? The TV 's colors are so off. it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie. Getting  enough brightness right to make the colors work. Because if you don't want the monitor to blind you when it's snooze  then good luck watching the movie in any other  color than black  and red. The worst thing was the food - salad was frozen. The beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty. My partner's chicken was swimming in a  lot of oil and flavorwise, it was hitting all the wrong spots. They believe in  flavor and dump  shit ton of  butter on their food to make  them taste edible but did they get that wrong.  He ended up eating bread and butter only. Same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast. Bacon was extra salty.  And the fresh  fish bowl was  not as frozen  with the salad.  A very poor  very disappointing experience. "
3.0,Welcome to London. I am a regular BA flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become  a Tier 2 airline. The journey  was in the Concorde lounge Dubai  and it is  this very small area with little food that in the two hours  I was there was not refreshed. Onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who  want to permanently work to rule.  Then when the  food came it  had only an  evening snack with no options. They  claim this is to allow maximum sleep. No other airline has done  this Breakfast was undercooked slop and  coffee was inedible. It is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd  for a ticket  and you can't even get a  drink The airline is clearly failing fast and I wish now I  have flown the luxury of Emirates  for half the price. Very disappointing and they don't care.
9.0,"From Heathrow to  Southampton Had a very nice flight , good cabin  service and informative  BA crew. First time to experience a 375 ml  shot of champagne on the drinks  tray which was chilled for me. Terminal 5 is a nice place to start any trip and would choose BA for my next holiday."
2.0,"Compare Gatwick to Funchal. In my  experience British Airways have got things  horribly wrong in  the race to the bottom. For travellers in Economy BA are now  simply another budget carrier and not a very good one at that.  Management have failed to understand what their true market is all about. Generally if people  want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of Ryanair or Easyjet. The BA brand has always been associated with  a quality that a full service  aircraft provides, but sadly not any more. The choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive. Frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers  can be offered  a hot meal and free drinks but all those  in economy must . And that assumes that from the enormous range  and 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any . On our  journey to and from Funchal there was a single trolley for the  full economy cabin,  in each case taking more than 2 hours to  move it from the front to  the back. Service  would only have been any slower  because the crew were trying to sell scratch cards  mixed with the  free food and drink! Maybe that's  in the next  phase of the BA master plan?!  British Airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of  but these days they are just an embarrassment, not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier, simply lost somewhere in the middle. As a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel  with my national  carrier but this  run to the bottom is driving  people away. Don't BA management understand  that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink?  Yes I think  I know the answer. All we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will  become complete."
8.0,"Zakinthos to London Heathrow. Poor check in at Zante airport. Not enough desks, slightly clueless  and Mrs B had to deploy laser beams to get front row  seat was free. Slightly late departure and made to wait on hot bus for while before boarding. After that very good flight again. Much busier Club cabin than on way out so two staff but they were still very  helpful Beetroot carpaccio , Goats cheese, melt in mouth Ox Cheek, poor  seats again. Again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co-pilot coming out to chat. Not left wanting the whole flight.  The bug bear on both flights were the economy passengers using the  only toilet at  BA This kept disrupting the cabin service and made my little one nearly have a problem because of the extra queues.  Who pays more for more toilets. Kids in dire need, ok, adults No! Time made up almost, T5 quite quick again so another good  day for us  on BA. Cheers."
8.0,"From British Airways from Belfast City  for London Heathrow. First time I  flew from Belfast  and it's a great little airport. I had access  into the BA  cafeteria which for such a small airport is pretty ! It was an evening flight  so there were a decent choice of cold sandwiches including: chicken, smoked salmon, egg, etc.  Our bar was  nicely stocked including Fever Tree tonic  and Grey Goose . Champagne was  provided on request. Due to a flight delay our  flight did not  leave from the air bridge, but  to gate 6, but we could access this gate using stairs from  the lounge, this  was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding  was announced in the main terminal.  This flight was probably at 30%  full so the FA had no problems serving passengers. The flight was delayed by 30 mins but we made some time and was at the gate at Heathrow 20 minutes . This was a last minute  flight for business  and was pretty expensive at £343 return. But as  a Gold member  you got most  of the business  class benefits."
8.0,"Toronto to London  flight and was  very pleasantly surprised.  Private Lounge in terminal 3 at  London is small  and quiet compared  with others. Great  window seats overlooking  the Separate meal  prep area prior  to flight allowed  me to focus  on sleep during  the red-eye that left at 22:00.  Lunch in lounge  is buffet style  and had a  pretty good made  to order noodle . Drink choices  very adequate. Staff very helpful and  friendly Flight left  over an hour  early but made  good time and  arrived early. Cabin  attendants were extremely  accommodating and helpful.  Plane seats must  remain the most talked about issue  at BA club , They do indeed ""pack them ,"" compared to any other business  class flight I have taken. That  all seats fully  equipped I had no issues with  the equipment and  service was very  pleasant Aside from  bathroom and morning meal service privacy  concerns never came  out between me and fellow traveler. Cost of flight  was 30-50% less  that other business  travel options available  for me so  that this in  general experience was very good. As  another side note , on to Madrid and BA lounges at LHR  are fantastic. W"
9.0,"London Heathrow to  London From parking  up and greet ings inside the  terminal via bag  to security and  the shops took only 50 minutes.  arrived on time,  received warmly. Managed to grab the  last row at online check in. From take off . Purser looked after the business  end brilliantly. Drinks and nibbles out  hot and refreshed  before asking. Meal served quickly. Carpaccio  and melon with  fresh prawn, miso cod, not overcooked,  potato mash and  a Average dessert  with cheese and  Red Wine topped  up regularly. Coffee  into a mug. All through the  day staff looked  after my nervous  young wife and  our four year  olds with great care and attention  As well as the rest of  my cabin. Priority  ticket and separate bus to terminal.  Very quick passport  checks and bags  loaded onto the  plane as we  walked through. The crew had been  so kind and  patient with us and in good  humour Apart from  delays in leaving  the FAB."
8.0,"Flight to Vancouver.  I booked our  flight with them as the price  is unbeatable. Our  initial flight to Vancouver was delayed by approx an hour. We were  sitting on the  upper deck and  everyone was impressed by the room we had (window/Aisle and 3 middle ). The crew  were great with  our young sons offering them extra drinks, pillows etc. Food was OK  for kids Mac cheese was better than the adult meals). Entertainment was good and flight  went smooth most of the way. On our return  flight we again  faced a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up  due to a strong tail wind.  Fortunately we were  at the top  deck and it was so quiet up there it  felt lovely. Food  is again just ok. We had an incident where  the son spilt  a bottle of Fanta all over  me midflight when everyone was asleep.  I was drenched and I had  no spare clothes for him. I spoke to a  wonderful member of crew who couldn't  be more helpful. She found some first class PJs for him to change into and  gave him a couple of extra goodies and she  checked up on us a few times after that  saying how good  we had been  on the flight.  She really made  what could have been a stressful  experience much easier  as her positive friendly attitude really helped me out. I was pleasently surprised by BA on both legs of our journey  and I wouldn't hesitate to book with them again,  its a shame they can't up their game food wise."
6.0,"Welcome to Sao Paulo. An exceptionally  long flight, both  in good and  for bad. Cabin  crew were disinterested  and I was  made to feel  refreshed when I  was at the  desk for a  glass of water  after dinner and  food service --  relief I'd never felt before. I  got somewhat snubbed , after asking for help (being  stuck loading my  checked hand luggage into the OHLs ). FA took heed of an  older woman telling him her bag  was ""two tablets in and is fragile"" so should  get stacked on top of mine,  and didn't bother to ask me about the contents  of my bag  since my laptop  still haven't worked , I slept  during dinner service,  I was awake  for the standard  course of a  meal A continental/charcuterie option would go  for a treat on this route,  you imagine, but  only had a  sort of flaccid  continental breakfast or  breakfast omelette. My  third BA economy flight after travelling long-haul in Premium  Plus and Club  -- I can see why this is the bargain  -- but still better than several . I felt  when we arrived ; the crew  were (for the  more part) friendly.  Still more to ask for."
1.0,"I had a  good flight to  London in Club . Staff were  not BA quality  and flight experience was awful. Club  economy section with  little leg space.  Also was no inflight entertainment. Lounge  to Istanbul probably  smallest of the  worst I have  been to. Drinks,  small cakes and pastry - nothing  that I am  yet to see  more British Airways  on a budget . "
1.0,"Imagine a flight  between Bangkok to  Singapore and you'll have some locals  and holiday makers  and wish to  have a taste  for Thailand in  our meal choices. First meal service : Thai Green Curry (veg) and  the second Thai Red Curry (chicken). . No one  has come up  with two Thai  flavours that were  that little bit  more different? So  then meal service begins and I  was going to have the chicken satay starter and  second course salad with grilled prawns.  Now the chicken  starter dish has  be replaced by  the prawn dish which turns out  not be every  thing from the chicken satay apart  for the chicken  but obviously with  onions  I  thought ""I don't want the prawns for starter as  am having the prawn main meal."" I should not 've worried as  a prawn salad  was off.  Ok so prawns  for starter and  we have garlic  herb crusted chicken  breasts with onion  with mashed potatoes,  fresh spinach and tomato. Well I'm  never sure how  we did it  but the potatoes  were disgusting to  the point I  stopped eating them.  The chicken breast  was dry and  had got no  trace of herb or garlic or  onions to be  used and the  garlic sauce could  hardly save it even if there  had been enough  on it. Mushrooms  tasted very meh,  onions and spinach  were fine but all in all inedible. The bread  itself didn't win  the prizes either.  I just gave  out and refused  not eat it. Now when this  was served I'd  started drinking rose water and wanted  my glass of  red but the FA was off  too quickly. No  I press the  dinner bell. Which  is reset before  someone comes. Press  this again and think I'd better  get on with  eating my food.  Then some one arrives and notices  me not eating my main course and after I  told them it 's disgusting I  ask why no  one has answered my call button.  Again I'm just  confused what did I want and  they say it was the wine  as it is  just bit too  much now and  I have port , as cheese  on crackers will  become my next  meal This does  not appear for fifteen minutes. During  which time I  was offered the vegetable thai green  curry to replace  that inedible main  dish that isn't  to work for  me So a  matter of hours  in I'm a  bit peckish and  want to raid the club kitchen . I find some quite pleasant . Back at  the seat I  realise I need  some G&T with  water but ten minutes later no one has arrived  not even been  to our cabin.  There is no  water in the <mask> galley between <mask> two club <mask> cabins and <mask> no member <mask> staff in the larger CW <mask> I do find one in <mask> second galley. <mask> ask and <mask> call button <mask> tested and <mask> to be working but three <mask> I've tried <mask> use it <mask> been ignored. <mask> service. Now <mask> to the <mask> meal service. <mask> there appears <mask> be no <mask> unlike stated <mask> the menu. <mask> ask the <mask> about this <mask> am just told everyone is <mask> the same, no explanation. The <mask> turns out <mask> be smoked <mask> with a wasabi dressing. The <mask> is tasteless <mask> salmon is fine. Now this <mask> a pity <mask> my choice of main was <mask> to be <mask> meze that had smoked salmon <mask> a major <mask> and now I have to <mask> again. Ok <mask> meal, I'm <mask> a choice <mask> smoked salmon <mask> or red <mask> curry so <mask> choice really and I decide <mask> give up <mask> go to <mask> restaurant when I disembark. Just <mask> recommended at <mask>"
1.0,"Flew Rome to London Gatwick. Big  mistake I paid £180 to fly with British Airways just for one  flight and the plane was delayed  two hours and 41 minutes because of late arrival of another aircraft. Instead of arriving at 21.30 we landed almost at midnight. No refreshments were offered, nothing. The customs queue  were massive, I got home at  2 in the morning. I decided to pay extra for BA instead of flying Ryanair and it was a huge mistake. Even the air conditioning in the plane whilst still on the ground did not work. BA is not worth the extra money. Staff did not speak a word of Italian."
3.0,"Having flown First Class from London to Cape Town and Club back from Johannesburg I have really noticed a significant downgrade in BA service and standards compared  the premium flights I have taken in previous years. The seats in  London had crumbs on them on arrival, in Club  there was sticky stuff on the arm rest which  never been cleaned. On the return  leg flight in particular, the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower; on 3 occasions I had to ask for a G&T, eventually I only received it by going to the galley. It was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their  service and conversation.  service in club  was average. First  person in T3 not great: sole  time spa person  decided to take an hour off from 1840-1940 (leaving a scribbled paper sign saying ""back in an hour"") which wasn't helpful given several long haul flights were leaving at 9pm.  When I tried to book an appointment on her return, she told me she was  tired and full (whilst checking Facebook on her iPhone). In terms of  the product, the Club seat just  doesnt compare with  Premium any more: it's way too  small and storage  space is dire. These flights were 'miles burn', I  should be accruing more avios with  this"
4.0,"London to Milan. Having read about BA's cut backs on service, I approached my flight with slight trepidation.  It was not too disappointed though. The flights were smooth and left on time, seating fairly comfortable, consider  it was a 80 minute flight. Pre-board and on board announcements were efficient and informative. The downside however, was the in flight food and drinks service which was in disarray. Although BA on European routes have also opted for charging for virtually everything that low cost carriers do, I still expected some efficiency. It was tediously slow,  and the attendants pacing up and down the isles to get an item not in the trolley. The glossy M&S menu looked good, but too laborious to get some food and pay for . With some  lines split up,  searching for items took longer, with  staff getting impatient and noisy. By  he time the trolley reached the back of the  aircraft the descent had already begun. It is a shame that our  national carrier while giving the illusion of a quality airline, is anything but. Come on BA, get your act together, or at least like  this quote I once read, ""we are like British  we love, we may be late, but we're getting  better"
5.0,"London Heathrow to  Romania A full flight both ways  to Bucharest using  an A321. Boarding  into London was efficient and orderly. The boarding in  Barcelona was more akin to a rugby scrum! Any  lack of control  by BA went  most of the  blue The plane  was clean, but  the interior was  cramped and the  aircraft rough around  its edges. There  were no USB ports or entertainment  which makes for  another long 3 . The M&S  food service worked  fine flying out  of London, but  not so returning.  The Inventory must  of been limited  on departure as  the products quickly  ran out. Leaving a selection of  sweets and crisps!  As the BA  cabin crew are  quickly learning how  to take payments quickly and efficiently,  this slows the  flight down too."
7.0,"London Heathrow to Bologna. I have given a decent score overall as both of our flights were on  budget and got us and our luggage safely from A to B for a competitive price. The planes were clean and modern. However like many I do feel sad that the service on BA has been downgraded so drastically. The buy on board scheme is a bit chaotic and on the flight out the trolley only reached us about 15mins before landing. It’s hard to say it is so slow, other airlines are much more efficient. The crew were very pleasant  and there is limited chance for interaction as the buy on board takes most of the flight. I  felt it was quite poor that  any announcements or communications were made on either journey in Italian. To be honest there was nothing to distinguish this flight from those I have taken with EasyJet, so now will make my  decision purely based on price rather than any loyalty to a particular airline."
8.0,"The Heathrow to  London was a  good experience. Club Europe cabin was  only really a  Business class cabin,  but economy with  a centre seat  built into a  sofa Other than  a lack of  elbow room and  rear seat recline , cabin was  excellent The meals  served was very  tasty with a  vegetarian starter, decent hot main course  then tasty dessert.  It was endless  coffee and hot drinks available during  the flight. The  airline cabin crew  and after the  flights were very good and could  not do enough  for you. The  air was clean  in both directions.  On the plane both in London  to Keflavik was  pleasant"
2.0,"Larnaca to London Heathrow. Despite being an executive member and booking seats  6 months before on most flights,  these last 3  months I have had my seats changed. Last time my family split up despite booking  the 10 last  year Had this have been a  one off then I wouldn't mind  so much but this is the  third time in  6 months. I  repeatedly called BA and even emailed  its media team, even at the airport I tried  and rectify the situation but no one interested or even prepared to  explain me why.  Customer service and attitude of BA  employees is shocking.  This Alex Cruz  experience in the airline has gone  by so fast  is hard to believe."
9.0,"San Jose to  the Gatwick return.  This outward flight  is delayed for  another hour at  Sao Jose due  a poor weather but the pilot  keeps passengers informed of the situation  in regular intervals.  For the flight  I was lucky  also to have  no empty seats  in my aisle  and as the  passenger in the  row directly in  advance of mine  put his seat  up as soon as we took  it making it  hard to hold  the book at  some distance and then jiggled and  bounced as he  passed the IFE ; it would have been a  miserable flight without  my seat to move along to.  Our cabin staff were friendly and  accommodating and did  occasionally disappear after  the meal service  and answered passengers , and made  its rounds with  tea and fruit ! The food  tasted of good  taste so it  was despite the  weather a good . On the  flight boarding was  easy and efficient, and the cabin  staff once again, friendly and helpful.  While not as  comfortable as on  my outward leg,  still perfectly acceptable.  People usually try to take a  shorter flight, involving  security but this  extra flight was  well worth the  extra expense."
1.0,"London to Keflavik. British Airways lost  control of my  luggage on our way to Iceland for a week long vacation. This  seems understandable, bags get delayed all the time. However,  after I attempted  to contact British Airways concerning my delayed bag and to ask for help with getting a hotel room, I was disconnected  multiple times and given contact numbers that turned out to be fax numbers. The delayed bag contained our  travel bags and  tent for a one week camping trip. Not knowing if we could be reimbursed for a hotel and seeing that hotels  around Iceland cost upwards of $200  each night, we were forced to  stay in our rental car until  that next day  that we were able to rent  the tent. Since  filing my claim for reimbursement, British airways has done everything in their power to avoid reimbursement. I have been told my partner who purchased  our tickets must fax written permission for me to handle the claim even though the baggage was under  my name, paid  directly by me,  while all costs for tent rental , toiletry items  are paid with my credit card.  This is shameful  that a company can operate this way and treat people so poorly. I urge you  all avoid at  ALL costs!!"
3.0,"Tokyo Haneda to London Heathrow. This  is the return leg of a code share flight with JAL. I flew JAL on  my way out and the service was superb and meals delicious. On  our return I  was embarrassed that  it is our  favourite airline, mainly  due to the  absolute abysmal meal quality. White fish consisted of 3 tiny pieces of  meat surrounded by  a brown, fatty unidentifiable, flavourless mass. The tiny token broccoli was a  dark brown mush. Service was efficient, bordering on perfunctory.  Unfortunately we brought  every other food on board. Please BA, either do  something with long haul meals altogether as mooted and declare your budget airline status or serve more appetising, less embarrassing fare. You can't stay 'stuck in the middle' for long!"
1.0,"An appalling airline.  Could definetly not . Flew Rome  to London Heathrow.  Due to the  likes of Qatar,  Kuwait and Qantas  which do not  fly close. I will never travel  by British Airways . Flights delayed  between London to  Paris by over  in between 2  days they could nt take off  and land smoothly  with perfect conditions.  The food is shocking and over cooked The planes  are out dated.  The stewards and stewardesses are rude  & unprofessional compared  to the professionalism of other airline 's"
7.0,"Welcome to Gatwick.  Check in was  smooth thanks to  great help from  the check-in desk.  The staff at  our gate were  excellent and ensured  we did not  waste a huge  period of time. The welcome on  board was exceptional,  and the cabin  and service was quite regular for  the remainder of  our flight (ie,  nothing exceptional or .) The seats  are very appealing, but the seams  around the point  between the upright  or horizontal parts  of the seat back are out ta line and  makes it slightly  awkward to sit  on after a while. This is a great shame  for a good looking cabin. We  set off twenty  mins after the intended time, due  to a late  approach to boarding  and an extended  delay time. However,  the pilots did  the great job  of keeping us  updated to the reason for the  delays and the  slow progress in  speeding up the  remaining time. Overall , flight was  quite regular from , but the  friendly ground staff,  accurate information as  to the delay , friendly cabin  staff made it  very good service."
3.0,Flew Zurich to London Heathrow. I 've flown 14 times with British  Airways in the last 5 months. I've seen a  real degradation of service. Flights are frequently late or cancelled and the staff are worn down. They were  very smart and full of energy. Sadly they seem  they have lost  their pride. A huge shame.
3.0,"New York to Cape Town via London Heathrow. A huge disappointment. Even worse when you  put it in context of what British Airways used to be. We decided to fly  solo  because I can't stand Club world (backward seats, forward facing seats almost on the aisle),  claustrophic, poor overhead  lighting on some  planes Seats were  too narrow, poor seat controls (unable  to independently control the different seat axes, foot rest  has to be set manually), American Airlines and Cathay Pacific new business class products are far better than BA first class.  Was great on  first leg with the new Pansonic system, dreadful on  our 2nd leg with the old  one  Food was mediocre at best. Breakfast JFK , LHR was passable, dinner LHR to CPT passible  My wife's fish was okay my hamburger was inedible.  Shuttle service slow. Cabin Crew from  NY was excellent, to Cape Town was passable. Changing planes in Heathrow  like a nightmar.. I am OneWorld Emerald, never Again"
2.0,Had to get  a deck which  are rare flying  between London to  Paris Cabin was unclean with earbuds  and paper on  seat from previous  flights No hello ! Gold status.  Soon became clear  British Airways are  the sort of  ship to rule.  No stewardess for  the upstairs. Three  people to serve  dinner which was  boring and tasteless.  The Service Director  who appeared once  in my TV  screen refusing to  eat in open  cockpit Never ever  again will I  spend thousands of pounds for bland  customer service.
10.0,"Florence to Bristol. A positive first experience and I will try to  try BA in  the future. When I booked the flight for myself  with my 11  to 13 year olds I was automatically allocated seats (no charge), 23kg  plus checked luggage included at no  further charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest. A few  days before the flight, during online check-in, I noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket. I telephoned BA's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within  the hour and  we received a call back with an update part  halfway through the process (no charge and no hassle). All staff from  customer services to ground staff to  flight crew were  friendly Staff on  my return flight went out of their way to  try and help a young mum with an upset  stomach We were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. On this flight to Bristol everything is included in your ticket. We had  free drinks but  a couple in-front had G&Ts. Our  dinner was salmon with couscous, bread,  salad and a mint. On the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken  soup with a chocolate brownie. The meals were actually really nice. Both  our flights did depart late for different and, what I believe were, unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out  of Italy still arrived early. Some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody  appeared concerned and it was passengers  that hadn't got themselves to the  gate that further held the flight up. I wasn't bothered which airline I flew with.  The criteria were  that I could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and BA came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight. My criteria will still exist but I will certainly be looking at BA first in the future."
2.0,"Salzburg to Gatwick. Awful experience. Flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and BA handling in Salzburg did apologise for the delay. Once boarded with a  normal flight there were 4 crew  members 2 to serve Club with  only 8 passengers and 2 to serve about 120 or more economy passengers. Usual fight for bag space. I was desperate for some water and asked the crew can I buy some water  as they dragged the trolley to the front of the cabin. I am in seat 23C right at  my back. I am told no, I have to wait for the trolley. I wait , wait and  as we fasten our seat belts  for descent to Gatwick the trolley gets to seat row 20. The 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments, and tell row 20 that the service is now closed, and pass the trolley back to the behind galley. All this as the CSD stands chatting in the Club galley with the other crew member. 1/4 of cabin not given the chance to even buy a  glass of water in a 2 hour dinner time flight. No smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling. Not  even a flight map to help  save time. Terrible airline. A national disgrace, worse than any budget carrier with high prices and terrible customer service.  I  am only rating  BA as 2/10 as they got me from A to B safely."
1.0,"London to London : You must  reconsider your rating  of British Airways  unless you truly  appreciate how bad  they have become.  While delayed, that , I accept,  but the BA  cabin staff handling  is awful - to the point of zero in . Once boarded  after fighting for  a bin space,  I did give  us polite and nice apology, but  the cabin staff  service (that has  always been their  selling point) was . Aside from  the fact 2  passengers smelt as  if they had  applied a complete  load of aftershave  in their heads  - unpleasant in a confined space),  their service to  these lowly passengers  was condescending and . They seemed intent with making  funny faces and  insulting comments about  other passengers in  the hearing of  many of us,  something that is  absolutely not acceptable.  There they were  standing stationary in  an aisle trying  and sell food  and drinks and we had to  stand long periods  with such rudeness.  BA management should  have fired, or  very least the  CEO Mr Cruz,  who is destroying  the national airline.  He not a  bad old man, just a customer  of over 50  year experience of  flying British Airways  and BOAC and  BA and a  direct witness to  the demise of  what was a  good airline."
2.0,"Athens to Newcastle via London. Another  unpleasant experience. Woken  from 7am by  email to say  my flight to  Athens cancelled for operational reasons - phone numbers listed to rearrange. One not open till  1200 GMT, the  next one no longer in use. Website also useless: 'We are experiencing technical difficulties - try again later.' 2 stressful hours later managed to get rebooked onto much later flights  - but downgraded on both sectors.  Still not happy . I was involuntarily downgraded on my last BA flight at Easter!] Athens used to  be a great  departure lounge. Now it's provided by someone else for varied airlines and was pretty grim. Partly because it  is filled with numerous disgruntled passengers also downgraded from  a cancelled flight. Flights adequate but no different really to service of any budget airline.  Was apologetic about  this but clearly  felt they have  a voice in BA's direction. Athens ground staff were  helpful in dealing  to unhappy people - albeit unable to say much other than to apologise and say make sure you  pay / claim.  BA are lucky  they have such brilliant front of house staff and cabin crew - without them I'd  have already deserted. Still waiting for any response from airline re EU compensation / downgrade . 2 weeks after submitting forms  and emails. This could surely be automatic [managed by most US airlines]  but contrasts with  my recent Air  France experience of  far more trivial  inconvenience where within  24 hours I'd received a voucher and a personal apology."
5.0,"London Heathrow to  London Orly. Terminal 5 busy. Lounge was ok but kids area T5 North limited we  had to take our youngest downstairs. Aircraft was ok but could have been cleaner. Lunch was ok for  a short sector.  Total summary all was ok. However, we really do expect more in the premium cabins. It is with regret that I have to admit that I have booked our next  premium business class flight with another provider. BA will not retain their premium clients if they continue with their current model, I am sure that those who use point etc  would remain loyal. However, those of us who pay their hard earned cash for club world will begin to take their business elsewhere. It's  hardly this particular flight that's at fault, more a general trend downwards."
2.0,"Toulouse to London Heathrow. This airline  may one day  receive its comeuppance for posing as  a quality flag  airline (it has  must be said,  no expense is spared on its branding) while operating  as a cheap and sleazy budget airline, thanks to  this rationale of its greedy and  arrogant new management. I have Bronze status with BA  Economy Club, have  flown a dozen  points over the  last year (both  for Business and  Premium Economy) and am increasingly irritated with myself that I chose to collect points with  that particular airline.  I was caught up in the  BA meltdown in  June (flying from Rhodes to London),  and I was  one of the  lucky ones (who  would remember those  horrible news reports of passengers stranded all over the  place for 4 days?). I had to purchase a  return ticket on a charter flight from Rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled (along with hundreds of  cancelled BA flights  in May); this (incidentally: ghastly TUI)  cancelled flight arrived  too much later  than the flight  originally booked that  it lost my pre-paid hotel booking at the airport,  which the airline refused to refund  until I lodged a claim. The  airline only refunded  both for my  previous flight and  my new flight,  complete with EU compensation, after I  filed a second  flight a month  into my first claim, as they  also neglected to  cash a cheque for me, according to the customer ! Their customer  experience is beyond  and I suspect they swear company oaths never to  even apologise for  any failings (all  you get is  angry with us,  no trying really !), lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability. I am unfortunately due to fly  for them again at the end of the month  in Belfast, and after two calls to their contact  centre (based in India, with a poor connection and  no communication overall)  still do not know if my  traveling companion will  get allowed to travel on a domestic flight as  another Canadian citizen without a UK  ID document. The customer agents I  speak to gave  me contradictory answers, which, in turn,  ran contrary to the (almost non-existent)  explanations provided on their website. On the flights I have booked which have actually taken , I have by turns found  ourselves stuck along  my fellow passengers  in the tarmac  after an hour and a half in BDX when  our plane lost  the takeoff spot, having waited for delayed passengers (would  anyone admit this was their fault? Nope, it was all air traffic control's fault!), been held on the tarmac in TLS for an hour  while they sorted out luggage which  had mistakenly been put on our  plane retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk <mask> my Club seat (no apology from the flight <mask> who seemed annoyed at having to handle it), <mask> in a <mask> totally encrusted <mask> potato chips apparently used as confetti by a <mask> passenger and <mask> myself wedged <mask> totally drunken <mask> abusive passengers in Club and <mask> scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival. As <mask> mentioned, I <mask> been one of their luckier <mask>"
2.0,"London City to Dusseldorf return, flights operated on behalf of BA by Eastern Airways. The cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part  was the trip ceases. Cabin Crew must of been members of the Basil Fawlty school of Catering. The outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out  for the three of us. The young stewardess took  my orders, then we heard a crash as the  old stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that  our aircraft only had two meals  then asked for a volunteer to give up their meal. The meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented. On  arrival at Dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal. The arrivals boards in the airport say terminal B and we were dropped off at Terminal C. Our delivered to terminal C and we had to walk to Terminal B if you were been met. The return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents  that BA is becoming famous for at overseas airports. Check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to LCY and 2  minutes before the  flight to LHR. I can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf. As the flight to LCY may only  cost max 100 pax and they would of been  happy to see the flight loading the day before. The check in  queues were reasonable and two were  really smart only to be let down by the young female on Club Europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle. Which looked totally out of place in uniform. The flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals, which meant  all 3 passengers were offered a so called Ham & Chasse croissant  which looked if  he had seen better days. Again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has Wizz and Ryanair, in fact they have better staff than Eastern Airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process.  I was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills  both crews displayed. On arrival at LCY it become apparent that the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind. The handling agents at  the could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight. I did phone on Monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system. <mask> morning I spoke to a member of senior <mask> at Dussledorf Airport. About 4 hours after this call the bags had been found <mask> the baggage handling area at the airport. They will be put on the late flight tonight which means I will <mask> it nearly 4 days after it became missed. <mask> is a pity that we <mask> review the ground handling agents at airports as no they would have to have <mask> let negative results be posted."
1.0,"What is happening  at British Airways? Flew Vancouver to  London The A380  happens to be my favorite long haul aircraft, but BA is definitely . Cabin crew  is friendly and  accommodating despite not being a full complement of crew.  The dishes were  taken off the menu, apparently due  an ongoing dispute? Why? Food was  among the worst  you have ever been served on a business flight. The seat configuration is outdated, blankets threadbare and pancake thin pillows. The constant cost cutting by their management  are now laid  bare for all to see, they  have to spend  some time on a Singapore Airlines aircraft to see what business class  actually is! BA's  glory years are well and truly  over it will take a miracle to bring them back!"
9.0,"Return to London Heathrow. Premium Economy very spacious with 38 inch seat pitch, very good IFE. The 2 crew serving this section were excellent:  highly engaging and  polite Amenity kits appreciated. Chicken curry was delicious- my brother and fellow traveller both advised their steaks were the best they  have eaten on  the airline. Impressed with warm bread rolls. Plenty of wine. Did not eat breakfast. Negatives being toilet and galley noise behind last row 38, elderly cabin, 8 abreast seating on Boeing 747 compared to 7 abreast on the A380. Outward from London to Johannesburg the upper-deck Premium Economy  section on A380 is very personal and much more spacious and quieter than on Boeing 747 aircraft. Nice wide selection on IFE. Once again excellent, young and polite crew. Beef steak asparagus dinner and orange chocolate dessert was delicious. Negatives being inedible cold hard bun prior to landing in JNB, although hot breakfast was  available which I didn't partake in. Overall a very good experience and would recommend BA."
3.0,"Left Oslo to  Stockholm via London.  So extremely disappointed with Business Class on British Airways.  Their flat beds  are very narrow  ( I'm only  21 and weigh  120 lbs.) and  so not very  comfortable The lunch served (beef entree)  were inedible except for the tomato/mozzerella starter, the cheese and the dessert.  ( had wanted  the salad but  been told it  is unavailable). Afternoon  dinner was better  or certainly not ! The so-called warm scone was  quite cold and  some sandwiches were still very cold  from being refrigerated.  They had asked  about both a  cold Coke and an apple and  the steward forgot  my requests."
3.0,"London to Warsaw. I have not flown with BA  in the EU  in a while and decided to  seize this chance  to fly with  it on a  flight to Poland.  We had paid  less than GBP 20 for a return ticket and had no free  food services whatsoever. You need to  charge for your food on board. If you decide to go on  this cheap marketing promotion, please lower your ticket fares down, more in  common with Easyjet  and Ryanair."
3.0,"Athens to London with British Airways. To call this  first class is some sort of mean spirited joke. To start with British Airways lounge is provided by  staff which as jammed with both people and a bad assortment of food. The actual  lounge (3D) had  NO power plugs and no TV at the front  facing the seat,  something you find in economy in  London The seat  width was narrow and the pitch was pathetic. Flying premium economy on  Virgin Pacific is dramatically superior. The flight from Heathrow to Athens was on a very beat up B767 on Aug 4/ 2017. The food on this flight was both minuscule and horrid. It is amazing that they can attempt to call this  kind of service . Very disappointing."
2.0,"London to Montreal via London. 7 days I'm waiting my baggage. absolutely  NO information from British Airways. Customer  service in India and they cut  the conversation often. No contact With  British Airways, you  get full price  for a low cost service. Absolutely  zero customer consideration.  This is a  price for baggage."
3.0,"Back to Chicago. I am a  Delta Gold member and reserved three BA business class tickets to Chicago returning from Denver.  We selected contiguous seats so that  our young daughters and myself would sit together. A week before departure,  I received a message from BA informing me that  our flight was cancelled and that we were moved to an earlier flight on the same day. On the departure date,  we checked smoothly at the business class counter at . The fast track boarding pass reader let us  enter without a . The lounge attendant, however, curtly dismissed us as having economy class boarding passes. I checked and it was true, but I had not  checked it at  least till that point, since I had paid for  economy class, believed that everything was in order and was not told otherwise at check-in.  A customer service agent at the lounge told me that there was nothing he could do since it wasn’t him who  bought the ticket! I spoke to the manager who  responded and tried to search for seats on subsequent flights, but they were all full. He could not confirm if BA had any intention of compensating us  for the downgrade,  but had no explanation for why BA did not give us any other option with business seats despite  boarding the flight  one week in  Denver nor did  he acknowledge that BA had made any mistake in this ordeal. However, he did contact the crew and  advised them of  the situation. We ended up traveling  in economy class. To add insult  too injury, the airline was unable to place us next to each other, so the  aircraft was split  several rows apart). However, the crew was nice and allowed us to leave the aircraft first. They almost  seem to work  at a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff. "
1.0,"Nice to London ! I had to fly to Nice and back  after work. Booked through the Company  Travel Agency. Extra bag added both ways. I wanted to fly back to LHR earlier so my Travel  agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of  1000 GBP. When  I arrived at NCE the Ground  staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag, saying that  that was for  an earlier flight. I stood my ground, but the Head of Check in told me if I wanted to fly I had to pay  1300 EUR which  we did under . I had prebooked my seat as Silver to  find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which I loathe as the 767 is claustrophobic. I asked  all my bags to be offloaded and I would  fly on the next flight as is my right  always do so there was a  smile at the  door  The trend for BA  since their spiral to the bottom  was to outsource Check in Staff who have no comprehension of the BA system, combined with an arrogant ignorance that means  I will not be choosing this  company again. I have one more flight with them next week and  love it. I paid almost 1100  EUR to get to Nice and back today, in  fact I was  treated with disdain by Ground Staff, the Crew on board were utterly  miserable as they  came to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who, despite  their high prices, have the audacity to charge 7 pounds for a gin and tonic.  You are tired and worn. Toilets ! Please do yourself a favour  and book someone else."
2.0,"Back to Doha.  My flight got  cancelled due to  cabin crew strikes,  we had no  choice but to  continue on this  one due to  my commitment. The  ticket I had  booked was not  available on the  same Qatar Airways  flights and British  Airways refused to  take me, so  they could only  fly to Economy.  I would  recommend British Airways  as below the  minimum standard of  customer satisfaction!"
10.0,"Paris CDG to : It is difficult to find  something positive to write about BA.  We delayed, not  my fault, but  for nearly an hour the staff didn't communicate or  engage with the  customer They had  the good old  look at the  first one even  after it was time to snooze.  With a 700  passengers 45 minute  journey we should get better. We just seem to  be an inconvenience  to passengers and  NO one cares  about an extra  1 hour on  the ground in  an unclean aircraft.  Poor and not  worth the money."
1.0,"Back to Paphos.  Found at check in as another system failure. Leg room was shocking for a 4 hour flight. Definately  the low cost  flights now. No  energy drink, IFE and paying for  it Long haul  flight has barely maintained its standards but short haul  British Airways has become a disgrace."
3.0,"Unimpressed! Service very  bad impression that 's only a job by flight  attendant with no  service on this ! Perfunctory service  at best! Guess  what maybe all  one can expect  if you fly  on British Airways  on their economy ' Traveller', I  wonder if those  at the top' s decisions have  travelled the world  or are aware of the (much) superior service (most)  budget airlines offer  even in economy?  Please take a  flight from Qantas , see what  the service looks  like My understanding  was BA recently  lost a star, and are now  offering 3 stars.  Nothing understandable from  what was offered  on this flight! Food, awful, dinner of chicken, rice  and peas. Breakfast over Ireland was  a cream filled , and granola  was awful! Even a recent United flight from SYD  or SFO served better meals! No  shortage of crew to offer more beverages. And no  amount of water  throughout the flight  that most airlines constantly offer. The  alcohol offering was  not best part,  and reasonably good  with Pinot Gris!  They are alternatives  to the UK  and Canada, Air , Air Transat,  and On Westjet,  can purchase your  own but I'm sure it has  to be superior  than BA's offering!  My last flight  over Britain on  Virgin Canada was  far superior. Air France last October , Paris was  on Qantas to Australia, is always brilliant! The only  distinguishing factor on this flight was  their Airbus 380,  probably the smoothest  and quietest plane . Apparently British  Airlines CEO is an accountant and the 'bean counting'  was in the  drink and food  not offered! Service  of my flight  is budget airline service at best  which should be  a embarrassment to  the flag carrier!"
2.0,"Originally Aurways was  once one of  THE best airlines  around the world,  well known for outstanding inflight service,  good food, comfortable  & good entertainment  and a level  and professionalism unequalled  on many other . How times  had changed! Under  several CEOs, most  especially the current  at the post,  Santa Cruz, BA  has declined to  the level of  the budget airline. In fact, I've  experienced superior travel  experience on some  budget carriers. Flying  from Vancouver to  Calgary on the  weekend was superb,  and a wonderful  breakfast Beyond that  was atrocious. Dinner  was a tough  meal of chicken,  badly cooked vegetables  that dried up , Breakfast was  another farce, a  burnt bun with a smearing of  melted cheese and  no granola bar.  Not suitable breakfast ? The entertainment  options were far  inferior to what  we used to  offer and the  crew were unsmiling,  bored and inattentive  throughout the flight. No snacks, no  breakfast offering between  flights nothing! On  this same route,  Trans Canada is  superior in every  aspect It's very  sad that such  an excellent airline  was in the  hands of a  CEO who's strategy  seemed to be  a race to  rock bottom rather  that a quest  for be among  the best of ."
1.0,"Jet Airways is quickly becoming a  top quality, low  maintenance services, but premium priced airline.  Aside from removing  BA from their  fleet and replacing  them with Marks & Spencer buy-on-board  vouchers on that particular flight, they  have managed to  get out of  flights for those  that were willing  to pay. It was impressive to  watch so many passengers having and  expecting the same  option next time  you just fly another airline, that reflects that quality of service into  the ticket prices. This came only  one month after the major ""IT  attack that grounded  all BA flights for a weekend. The only thing  we have left  was safety -  If they lose  it then it's  lost"
2.0,"Catania to Gatwick.  Approximately 30min after the plane took  flight the food trolley was wheeled  up to the  economy class curtain  a staff man  assigned the task  was selling all  the leftovers from  the outbound flight. It took 2  minutes for the  food to reach  aisle 24 (our  seats there was no food left , even a  snack we had the last can  a Coca Cola , a bottle of water. Several factors contributed to this silly situation : BA Trying  to become a  lower cost airline  I did not realise that it  was sunk so  low when I  visited The fact  was only some  cash transaction could be used to pay.  The  use of the  aircraft for long  hours resulted in the trolley spending more time being  dragged up and down the aisle  to let passengers  out to the loo and back than it did  : BA Trying  To keep the  same toilet for business class passengers.  The inadequate   quantities of food  on board the  flight this meant  every sales person  needed to go  through what was  left with every  customer in the  name of finding  something that the  staff would accept. </s>"
5.0,"Flying to Gatwick.  I encountered on  27 July at  Italian Marco Polo , as a  result of cancellation  on flight BA2581  returning to Gatwick.  Through various conversations  that took place,  It would appear  that there were no British Airways  agents at Venice  Marco Polo airport;  everything is handled  via the local  flight agents. Obviously  some of the  issues are as  a result of mishandling by the local service agents,  they need to  are made aware  and re-trained if necessary as no  wonder BA are  charging them money  to carry out  their duties.   They were unclear  and in the  morning the departure  gate information did not help. After arriving at 13:00  passengers were eventually taken by bus to a hotel  about 1 hour  before arriving at  BA The following  day on the  return flight, we  started taxiing out  when a flight-deck  light warning light  came on creating  further delays while that was fixed.  I am all  round safe flying  but BA need  too improve their  service"
3.0,"London to London, which takes 3 hours. This is  a second bad  thing with BA.  When you want  to eat something,  that you have  you pay for  it They did not offer me  any glass of water. My first  problem was when  I flew from  Paris to London on June 10th and that flight was delayed for  4 hours. The ground transportation from  our terminal to  airport is awful  here at Heathrow Airport. "
1.0,"My London Heathrow to Accra flight  runs regularly late leaving LHR by  1 -2 hours  ( a regular  with this route for 18 years I have spent many hours delayed  leaving LHR). Started  out with BA at last choosing  a gate where they can process  checked hand luggage prior to the final gate check (gate 27 - rather than the  two gates at  London - hand luggage is a problem on this !). All looked good until the  gate crew lost  control of the gate on seeing the door to  a jetway open passengers surged forward  and then blocked  their entrance while  many calls made  from First, Gold, Business etc to come forward. It  is not pleasant  I have to  constantly push forward  and get to the gate as  an BA premium passenger. One First  rate passenger told  her gate assistant  they ""take control  out of the  gate She blamed  other passengers when actually it was just poor gate  management by the staff. It was  another miracle then  when the flight departed on time and arrived into Accra a little early. A first for me in  my years on  this route! Once  we board the  people on the top deck could  hardly have been  less friendly. A  pity then for  BA that they  provided such a  poor product to  deal with - poor food, poor  service in a  way that defies  any sense, lousy cheap amenity kit  then finally an  expensive entertainment package  who does not  deliver month after month. Catch up with the others ."
3.0,"Return to Orlando . Possibly the  worst pre and  return flight experience  anyone can remember.  Three hrs late  on the way  and almost three  hrs late on  the return journey.  Bad use of  the aircraft is  the blame. A  damaged IFE that  cannot be repaired  took two hours , try and  repair After this  repair a replacement  engine was required.  By the time  I arrived, BA  and their crew  to not fly  up to exceeding  2 hours. This  leads to a  massive 1hr delay  even for a  small crew. This  seemed avoidable and  shows the lack  and genuine care  the flight by . No refreshments  and no accurate  information just endless . They didn't  tell the children first and it 's a total . The plane  could not land  owing to bad  winds and had  then divert to  Orlando due to low fuel. Whilst  that seems fair  enough the plane  had actually 1hr  late leaving Gatwick  on the first  time so had  they left on  time it might  have landed fine  and passengers would  not have encountered  so long a  flight as we  had  A  real shame and  utter embarrassment to  those called British  aviation it does  not bring any  personal or professional  standards as far  a I can  tell I will  not be using  BA again."
2.0,"San Diego to London Heathrow. The worst business class I have flown : I flew  in the 777 so whilst it's not the newest plane in the fleet, I still expected some level of comfort. The seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. I'm a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat. There is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed, but does not line up with the rest of the seat. So your feet are raised. The armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around. Every time the person next to you moves, your chair moves too. The hydraulics must be connected. It was very  cramped The tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped  downwards and so drinks/meal tray did  NOT stay put. It was not secure and basically, was flimsy and unusable. I had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap. I was in seat 14A which was a rear facing window seat. There is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you (which is a forward facing aisle seat). The divider has to stay down until you are airbourne. So for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding, you are  looking a fellow passenger directly in the face. Very awkward! The tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn't stay put. It wanted to go back into the column and so I had to watch my movie at an angle. The food. Well. The fillet streak was tough and dry. I had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with American Airlines and  he did a much better job. The selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice. Service: if you want good service, don't get a window seat. You are cut off from the aisle, and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger, the cabin crew forget you are even there. I had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round, both with dinner and breakfast. The layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you  their drinks and  meals as they have go above the opposite passengers head! Not ideal with some turbulence. There was also  no wifi even though BA advertise as such. Apparently , Boeing 777 does not have the right equipment. In short, BA have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. The layout is impractical, seats are narrow, there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger, and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored. The 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly, the TV's stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal. I for one will not be flying BA business again."
8.0,"Flew British Airways  to Pisa to  Newark Gatwick. The two of us  landed at the  gates exactly two hours before departure. We had hand baggage only and  we already checked-in online and had boarding cards on our smartphones so  went to security.  Our queue was  extremely hectic and it took 30 minutes to get through. Although we  are flying Economy as BA Gold members we had  upgraded to the lounge. The lounge was quite dated  in design but  was comfortable with a good selection  of food and  entertainment for a contract lounge. We left the lounge  20 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control, the  line was long and slow and took 20 minutes  the get through.  Once through we  headed to the gates which was boarding for priority passengers. We received  our magic beep  and were upgraded  from Club Europe  ( of us are Gold members). We were seated  at row 7, it was the typical 3 seats but the middle  was blocked with  the tray installed.  The room not great but we 're both short.  Before take off we were offered  and I had  a glass of  water which was  poured from a  full size bottle.  There were then  given afternoon tea,  choice of three finger sandwiches: beef,  chicken and tuna and a slice  a Victoria sponge . All very  nice but I  did miss the scones in Club Europe. I also managed two top  bottles of champagne. The cabin crew  were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when  required The flight  departed on time and we were on a train within 30 minutes  after landing. Overall  having paid £50  less for the  tickets and with  our upgrade was  the bargain."
1.0,"My flight from  Hungary to London  is delayed by  three hours, during  the time British  Airways offered nothing  to help with  hotel reservations, despite  poor hotel availability  thanks to the  World Swimming Championships, no food, no  taxis to and  fro the airport).  in fact, BA doesn't even have a representative in Budapest, having outsourced it to a  local agent (who  tried their best  with the absence of any input from BA). Even  every customer service  line I phoned was answered from  BA (also outsourced). When the flight finally took off,  I could not even buy food on the plane.  We were told  by a BA  representative would meet us at our Heathrow arrival gate  to give us food vouchers, but  it / she wisely didn't show  up because I, for one, was  hoping for a voucher for 24  days of my  life which I  could get back rather than some  cheap food vouchers.  I have flown several times a  week for the last 40 years with many airlines,  I have never been treated as badly. I will  be flying ABBA (anything but BA) from now on."
1.0,British Airways cancelled my flight and put me on a EVA Air plane which had a different baggage  limit and I had to pay a £140 excess. I thought that  because my Booking was with BA they should pay  this excess which they refused to do. After months of refusing to  accept any responsibility I had to  have a court  order on which  BA admitted they  are at fault.  I have flown over 20 different Airlines and never  had a company behave this way when they are  involved in the  UK 
1.0,"Singapore to Newcastle via London Heathrow. Terrible airline. Avoid at all costs.  Very affected by  the global IT  crisis during the bank holiday weekend. Had to wait in line two hours to get  my new ticket. They were terribly slow. After the whole episode, I wrote an e-mail requesting compensation for  the flight delay & my misplaced . It's now July 2017 and I still have not gotten back my monies. Extremely poor customer service. Wrote e-mails twice chasing them for the refunds. They said they will check. That was more than a week ago and  not heard from  anyone yet. As  to the flight experience, poor. They have become so budget that they do not even provide necessary toiletries  and toothbrush for long haul flights. In-flight entertainment was also poor, very  poor selection of  drinks"
1.0,"Flying to London . I was  a Gold executive  and for years  and raved about BA. Sadly that 's hugely changed.  Last year I  went from London  via Frankfurt with  a daughter and  I had to  put food on . I found this highly irregular,  especially for a  budget airline. Today  i flew from  Berlin to London  and again experience  of this! This  looks disgusting! BA  have way higher  fare than others  and very much  higher than the  main lines and now also charge  for food in economy.  The  entire executive team  must be fired.  So BA have lost another client!"
10.0,"Newcastle to Boston  via London. Flight  from Newcastle to  London fine, although paying for a cup of tea with Avios was  not especially slick. A superb flight from Heathrow to Boston, even though  this was the day the latest BA strike started (19th July). Left  very late due  to Heathrow computer  issues earlier in the day but  we were kept fully informed about  it Seats on  very comfortable with plenty of legroom  for the bassinet ! Cabin crew  attentive and highly professional and there were regular considerate,  helpful updates from the cockpit. Food  was pretty good - dropping the second meal on this route is  never a problem for me. Entertainment not bad at all. Had a very nice chat with the captain waiting for the bags to arrive in the airport. All BA crew were a credit to the airline and if this is the norm for BA, I would happily fly  on them again ..."
1.0,"Flew from London Heathrow to Sofia. I have been  flying British Airways for over 40 years and they are truly awful . I see no difference now with easyJet or . The main  issue with BA  flights is the  incompetence and sheer unprofessionalism of staff I encountered. Everything in T5 is now self service including bag drop.  Free food, etc.

2.0,"Flew last week  home to Frankfurt.  Only light refreshments  and crew busy . Card terminals  which makes less time to be  available to passengers.  When asking what  was complimentary informed cold water"" and it came no  response or offer.  On the return I was  in a mid seat, asking if  this was a  free aisle I  am told no.

7.0,"This was a  two way Avios redemption flight. Fare : £17.50 and 7,500 Avios each. As a BA  family member I used the First class wing at  and this included direct access to the Galleries First lounge. We were through very quickly as there was no queue at security. The lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch. The former had better food offering, the sausages and mushrooms very tasty. Lunch wasn't  very good, I ordered a BA burger, the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate, my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and  boring - she left most of it. The buffet selection wasn't particularly interesting, some chicken,  some veggie curry  with chilli. My wife said the curry was okay but the chilli I tried was bland. The drinks on offer were , a gin  light was on, although I don't drink the stuff  my choice looked . I had a few glasses of Henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful Castlenau they used to have but not as  bad as the Taittinger they served a year ago.  I tried a few sips of a Kiwi Pinot Gris, can't remember what it was called but it  tasted very nice.  Then I couldn't resist a shot of Johnnie Walker Blue. The first class lounge itself needs some TLC, the gents are  old and unkept and none of the plug sockets worked. I normally try to fly another Oneworld airline other than BA. But if it has to be BA then I prefer to fly from T3 for  the excellent Cathay Pacific lounge. In fact I prefer the new BA  World First lounge than the Galleries '. The flight  home was okay, it pushed back slightly late and arrived at Bologna on time. I didn't bother with  a BoB as had eaten in the lounge and  were saving myself for dinner in Bologna. Cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite  a long time selling the BoB . We sat in a pair of two seats  next to door 3L. Really appreciated just two seats  for any neighbours  in the almost  empty flight. Due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front  & rear doors were used for deplaning, we were one of the  first passengers to exit. It was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to get though passport control then  the further 30 minute wait for  checked luggage. Despite  A lot of moans about BA <mask> this forum I can't really complain about the overall experience. As a Gold member the lounge access was free. But <mask> I paid full premium fare to access the lounge then yes <mask> be disappointed."
1.0,"Just did a  short trip from  Manchester to JFK and there were  just two good things about flying  British Airways, you  always use the  PA system from the start and we liked Terminal  B at Heathrow.  The rest was : The outbound flight was completely  cancelled so it  got delayed in departing, you would  like them to have known this so they would  been able to  try and ensure  that the flight left on schedule.  there was no . The return  trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complain. There  were only one inflight meal and the only other offering was a  packet of crisps  and an 18g chocolate bar. It felt like being  in school. Cabin  staff weren't overly friendly on either journey. Inflight entertainment was fine, lots  of films both  modern and old  to watch. We  would usually fly Emirates or Virgin but decided to fly BA to  giving it a go. If you  share similar thoughts,  then do it.  I won't be  satisfied with BA , they are  totally worth it.  This is very  expensive - elitist and inefficient."

Arriving at Berlin  checking in with only handbagge one of my party was told rudely that she had to check in her baggage despite  how it contained fragile items. Another of my party  also want to check in her hand baggage and was told no.  Both times the ground staff were inconsitant, rude and  disrespectful .I was  refused a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat. The new seat configuration is so narrow now I could not get into the allocated seat as I have a replacement knee which does not bend enough to get to the seat. Fortunately one of my party swapped with me  into an aisle seat. I put a small plastic bag with fragile items in the overhead locker, the steward, without telling me or consulting me, moved it. When I queried this I was told ""Madam,  I know what I am doing I have done this before"". I am 71 years old and I refuse to be so patronised so I was ready for a stand up row by  this time. Fortunately a lovely stewardess with this guy saw my face and jumped in with a jokey remark which save the situation. No food left at the back of the plane as usual. Why on earth are we paying premium prices for such appalling customer service? If I want a budget flight I will use EasyJet anytime."
5.0,"Flight to Boston  and London. Mixed  surprise we had to rebook suddenly for next-day business  class because my wife broke a  rib in her  back and had to go home  - BA cut  her no slack for the injury ; the change cost a fortune.  the good: flight  attendants were wonderfully supportive and helpful;  I was surprisingly  helpful wheelchair attendants  on LHR were  helpful The bad:  our business class was an economy  seat with slightly  more pitch and the middle seat blocked; Boeing 777  first class seats were very comfortable, but a seat in the middle of the 4-seat central block allowed no access to  an aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat  back or was using the footrest; LHR connection of  2 hr was barely enough for  a 3 to  4 transfer (BA  later said 1  hr would be  sufficient - even  with a wheelchair  attendant allowed priority through security and transfer bus. Also a nasty surprise: no wifi on  a 7-hr transatlantic  flight"
5.0,"London to Madrid,  first weekend flight.  Flight check in , fairly chaotic  with early morning  checks in and  departure but once  again was okay. Full flight and  airport staff being  quite keen to check passenger hand  luggage but managed  the get through  to my 2 pieces. Flight deck  was informative about  luggage delay. Cabin  staff struggled to  get through the  long onboard service  but I managed  a get a  small coffee after  taking very long  flight It is  such a short  journey and the  noise was low  so cannot complain  to much, but  that is now  very different to  the flybe etc."
3.0,"London Heathrow to Brussels return. Through work I have to fly frequently and am firmly  in the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium *. If your timing is right the prices reflect this, that is before the “add-on’s”. So be prepared  to get on ; be prepared  and be given the middle seat on the last or second to  last row, and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are  going to pay more. That way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated  a third to  fifth row up, it’s a win. Any flights longer than a couple of hours I strenuously avoid BA if I can - a shame  as in some  ways I grew up with BA (back in the  day of BOAC  & BEA). Having said that the flights to and from Brussels were OK in a  BA aircraft either way."
1.0,"London Heathrow to Accra. Flight left  London two hours  early - bit  without an explanation  that was really  that the ground staff boarded the  plane with only minimal time to  board This is always a busy  airport with passengers taking on loads  on cabin bags. Ground staff only started to collect  cabin baggage from  passengers with 20  mins to boarding and so there  was no room on board for  the luggage. Chaos in economy class.  On this flight it does not  stop when the  flight is boarded with anything less  then 1 hr  to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs  at least 60  minutes to board - it is  our most delayed flight out of  Europe because of this poor management. Fact. The ground  staff did nothing  to control the  passengers - simple and polite requests  could have helped. The grand staff  was downright rude and grumpy with  some passengers - on one of the money making  flights for the airlines they need to up their  game and just be polite (even if they do  really enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers). Once on board the crew were friendly  & professional. Very friendly but this  will make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean  or refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor  service and very poor quality seats. The cold/salad options  were far better than the hot  drinks in BA's  business class. Still no wi-fi on BA? Even discount  carriers like Norwegian have this now,  all along the flag carriers like Emirates and Qatar ?"
3.0,"Welcome to London.  Meet us there ? My main  complaint is the  food service. I was sat in  row 21, probably  most of the way back. It  was an evening  class flight,so everyone  tired & hungry.  The new M&S  machine was a  nightmare The flight  lasted just over  3 hours. It  took 1 hour  getting the single food trolley to  make its way  to my row. By the time it arrived all  that was available  except a KitKat  & some other sweets! They had already run out  on sandwiches /  finger food. It  was a long  wait because each  person had to  pay using credit card - and  the machine seemed  ot keep on  encountering problems. Also the variety on  the new M&S  sandwiches - whilst  obviously a good thing - meant  the staff kept  constantly running back to the galley  to replenish (clearly ) not enough . Have to  say this services  is no better  on Easyjet &  I will think  again about travelling  via BA. If  I wasn't paid for by work  I would not 've travelled with  BA The service has gone downhill over the years which is a  real shame for a national carrier."
7.0,"Gatwick to Bridgetown.  We managed to  secure some seats  which offered reasonable  knee room (I  was over 6ft), although after feeling the knees of  a passenger sitting  beside me, I  think he was not so lucky!  I had a  delay in take  out but apologies ! Food was  excellent and I was pleasantly surprised.  Staff members were  hard working, polite and professional. The  new 777-200was showing  signs of age (G-VIIW ) but compared to the  smaller aircraft we  were on last  week this plane  seemed more cared for. I am  unsure how BA  is going to  be 10 abreast  instead of the  Boeing 9. I  cannot conceive how  just eating a meal would be possible. Overall the  food was good  for this occasion. The IFE was  busy but worked, it did not  take time. "
4.0,"Welcome to London. Didn't have high  expectations but surprised  what bland and uninteresting this journey was. Started in  another uninspiring visit  in the BA  terminal with a poor food choice  very poky. Plane  looked just about clean but rather poor for business , The menu was poor and  probably the worst  you have seen.  The tea was  a afterthought and the forty minute  queue for a gate at LHR really summed up the state of BA today. Bland ing and lacking the passion to serve. Not a patch on Qatar Airways or Emirates  but makes you feel quite inadequate  as a Brit"
1.0,London Heathrow to  Manchester Flight was on time and ground service was  excellent However our  seats were changed  owing to aircraft configuration change which  was normal to  passengers but no  additional choice or  discount was offered (for Silver member!).  No complimentary service  was provided. Crew  member had problem  with the payment ! Luckily I've got some water  & treats from the airport shops.  Large cabins and uncomfortable seats -  but BA is  now a budget  company charging premium  rates and has  less service than  many budget airlines!   Have abandoned my  BA status and  are using other  flights I'm still  with BA as  payment in cases when the fare  is competitive on  my route. 
5.0,"Return to Gatwick,  hello world. Efficient check in, third  class lounge at  Newark airport was a reasonable place  and spend time  on the flight , usual facilities.  Prime time departure,  served with warm  glasses of champagne!  Overall ok though , a little grubby in places.  Food selection mediocre  at dinner, the meze starter was average at best.  My main of course was bland , tasteless. Some  in the cabin  staff attending to  the wife were  just as helpful  but they could 've been. Toilets  kept clean throughout ! Reasonable breakfast. I note the  lack of the  departures lounge at . After a  few hours +  delay this would  have been quite  nice"
1.0,"New York JFK - London Heathrow. The British Airways  lounge at JFK is truly terrible. It seems to  be been refreshed  too late but this means rows of scruffy seats  with toilets that are too few  for the crowds. Not enough chairs for the evening  flights that tend to depart within  the few hours  from each other. I wasn’t allowed  into the First Class lounge despite being a BA  Priority List member.  How much for  that Was instructed  at check in  and this was  their “sleeper service”  and I should eat in the lounge. Not an  order but an instruction. The Club World food on  display in the lounge for the  passenger experience” was  mediocre and of very poor quality.  The Cub World  food on BA  planes involves clambering over people to  walk out to the aisle, poor food (they did  have food), poor  musical entertainment, putting the inflight divider  down but never putting it back  down (BA train ee staff if they put the  window down to have the good manners to put  back up again)  and serve food and drinks. The crew obviously know  BA are providing an inferior product  to act accordingly.  The product and offer from BA  are so mediocre  I even saw  Business Class passengers  put their own  food on for  which the other  airline must be  eating as they take over BA in terms of service and quality  for aircraft. Shameful."
5.0,"Long packed flight  to Athens to  Newark Heathrow. Cabin  attendant spent quite  the bit of  money selling food  and drinks from  their trolley. Everything  had to be  - I had  a go to  way back for  another glass of  cold water -  - Small TV  screens hanging at  back displayed the  London route. Minimal  interaction with crew.  Everything was fine.  Cargo space overhead  was ample -  no charge for  seats Plane arrived  in time which  was a relief  because I had  not change terminals  and catch a connection. I had  three hours and made it. The  flight was followed  up by a  passenger survey by  the airline. I  felt glad when  that four hour  flight ended -  nothing special but  at least it  ended on time , safely at  home"
1.0,"Venice to Gatwick. I am done  with British Airways. It has the worst service and incredibly rude staff. We were supposed to fly back from Venice at 11.55 p.m on 10th July. The flight was delayed by an hour and a half. BA policy indicates that there will be no food vouchers or otherwise for flight delays of less than two hours. Fair enough. However, what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airport. The only cafe at the VCE Airport available to customers after security was shutting at around 11.30pm. When I went to buy some water, the guy at the counter refused outright.  Another lady had been there since 11 am (her flight earlier that day was delayed) and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher. The guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who was of no help and was incredibly rude. My partner tweeted about this to BA and there was no response from them at all although they were complimenting on someone's pics at the same time. We finally found a vending machine and there was no water there too. There was not one person from British Airways this whole time till 1am in the morning.  As if this wasn't enough, when boarding started and we were showing our tickets, we were told that that was the priority boarding line and the one next to us was for regular joes like us. We were the tenth/twelfth people from the front in the queue and the other queue was moving parallel to us. There was no sign or announcement separating the two queues. Instead of politely mentioning that, this member of BA staff shouts at us for everyone to hear and asks us to go to the back of the line. By then the so-called priority boarding was  started so both  the queues were meant for everyone.  After I mentioned this, she told me that I was cutting the queue and wasting her time. We just moved aside and waited for everyone else to board before we did. I am definitely never going to choose BA . "
3.0,"New York JFK to Manchester via Heathrow. Budget airline trying to retain  their big name brand. Flight was cancelled then booked  then delayed. Aircraft  was diverted to Liverpool whereby the passengers were subsequently abandondoned. Poor quality, no aftercare and  their customer service extremely poor in responding to complaints, when they eventually did the shrugged it off as ""Not their problem"". Disappointing and won't be flying BA again."
9.0,"After flying Boston  from London on  my A380-800, I  was on a  newly retrofitted Boeing ! The 747 s were newer , much more  spacious than those  in my previous  aircraft (they appeared  too be the  first ones in  the economy section  on the A380).  My seatback TV  for in-flight entertainment  have been significantly  improved The only  one of the  747 aesthetics and  design that was  lacking was the  cabin lights, which  had been replaced.  My cabin crew  was polite, professional,  and accommodating – no  surprises there. The  pilot even gave  passengers a personal,  welcome announcement before  takeoff which was  surprising given the  lack of preparation  done before a  long flight. The  flight itself was  completed at 6  minutes 59 minutes,  and without delay on either end.  Though I'm a  tad concerned that  Boeing is at  danger of turning  down a low-cost  airline under the  new leadership, my  impression was that  cabin crew are  still doing a  fantastic job. "
2.0,"Back to Gatwick. I used to admire and love BA. I now  not longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it. I think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations  without paying the  least inconsiderable supplement  for flying Club Europe. My wife , I have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years, have complained (and received some Avios in compensation) but, this time, the cup overfloweth, unfortunately  not with blessings. We had, once again (!) been  given aisle seats in separate rows even though my wife’s preference states that she likes a window seat – and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each  others – but , does BA have to keep  with this? The  journey as such started well enough in the new BA South Terminal Lounge, which was  lovely and had  another good selection  on drinks, food and magazines. When  boarding came for  departure and, amongst  which Club Europe passengers were invited  on board first,  this was no  change made at all, which resulted in an almighty scrum as just  everyone pushed forward immediately, exacerbated by then having to  be cooped up  in the stifling  atmosphere for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished. Once boarded, we were – unlike the other Club Europe passengers – not offered a glass of water but, worst of all (and unforgivable) found food debris and other dirt in between our seats (so much for having to wait for the cleaning  too be finished).  Once I opened  our meal tray, it clearly had not been cleaned as there were  holes and stains  around it. We took photographs and also pointed our  predicament out to  the very pleasant stewardess, who seemed utterly appalled when she looked. The meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards. And whilst I do not object  at being served  water from a large bottle, it means one gets only a (smallish) glassful so has  ot ask for a refill, something not everybody likes  to do. This  method of pouring from a large  container is clearly  a cost-cutting exercise. On previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge  seats for Club Europe passengers are available in airports like Corfu, Rhodes, Heraklion, even Seville  ( to BA’s website at the time – we  are told at all these airports , BA no  doubt pays for its passengers to  have access’) so, this time, my <mask> enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in Naples. She was <mask> No; but at least, we knew beforehand – or so we <mask> but when <mask> got the <mask> area prior to the gate <mask> we were joined by some rather merry Club Europe passengers who <mask> us that <mask> was a lounge (though not exclusively for BA use) that they had been able to access and enjoy! Why could <mask> check-in staff not have told <mask> The waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some. However, when a young lady arrived to deal <mask> checking boarding cards, passengers who were sitting beyond <mask> she stood, were forced to get up and move all the way back to <mask> other side. Club Europe passengers were amongst the <mask> to be <mask> so that did not look <mask> bad. Know what? We showed our boarding pass, then had to <mask> (no seats available) in a very cramped area for 14 minutes <mask> the gate <mask> opened. In other words, we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for <mask> than other <mask>"
1.0,"London to London : I am a BA Exec  Board member and paid over £2,500  each for Business  breakfast as had  arrived straight after  on both journeys.  The Originally was a Boeing 787,  then they changed planes to an  upgraded Boeing 777  for both journeys.  The 'flat' business  seat on YYZ-LHR  had broken and  their Service Director  could fix it.  A bench part  only 5 inches  not level to  my seat. Extremely  heavy and didn't  move a wink.  NO extra pillows  available in either Business or First. Food inedible on  all journeys. Outbound  order of British Beef was as  bad as old !! They should be ashamed of  the Business breakfast  from the YYZ-LHR as I've had better in a  local Joe's cafe.  Even the wine  service on the  plane not available on both legs.  Another case of  arrogance and under-delivering , Simply miles  behind the competition. The CSD completed  a complaint for  them and I  also wrote to Alex Cruz. Their Customer Services Team offered me £50  in vouchers. What  planet is he on? Now they have a very angry and dissatisfied  Customer It is  about the money,  it is the  customer "
3.0,"London to Montreal. I have also flown their economy plus (Montreal to ) and business  class  (London-Tokyo, London-Rome return). BA  fare is on a par with Ryanair. Business is okay. Economy plus  are very disappointing with very poor food. Regardless of class of travel, the seats are less comfortable than most of the competition. The following is a relatively minor complaint but it was very annoying given that it concerned a thriller. I started watching a movie on the flight from Montreal to London but the last 15 min of the movie  were missing. It looked like the recording consisted of  about the first 105 min (out of 121 min total) of the movie. In the next few days I tried to see the last  half of the movie on other two BA flights (business and economy plus) and in all cases the final part of the movie was  lost In addition to this minor problem, all BA flights were plagued by a more serious flaw in the infotainment system: the recording of the safety information was almost inaudible  leading to a cracking noise (once again, the same problem applied to  all flights)."
8.0,"Two flights from  Birmingham to Geneva  at London Heathrow in Club Europe.  Check in at  very rapid without a queue. Fast track worked well. Lounge was ok,  with limited selection of food. Onboard  the flights, the domestic and European  Economy class is  Business Seats with  good legroom, choice  in food (chicken salad, charcuterie and ) and good  cold drinks. The  staff were lovely,  friendly and good humoured despite having  not lot of  work to deliver  in short sectors.  Experience from GVA-LHR  was good with  one biz passenger  that became unwell and needed medical attention on arrival.  Most of this  was the Mixed  Class strike dates. The South Lounge at LHR was like a sauna,  and access impossible  to south security (involves a long walk downstairs then  up again). North  is better on  arrival but bathrooms generally dirty and in need of an update. Tagged priority bags were  often the last  off the belt  to Geneva which  was a joke,  though likely not  their fault. First  flight back in . Overall, the  Long haul business  flight is perfectly adequate, if for nothing other than  the queues. BA's  facilities are pretty poor compared to  some of their competitors, but was  always happy to  hear their crew  for doing an  excellent job."
8.0,"On to Keflavik. The British Airways experience has certainly  proved I'm happy to pay less and still be treated like the staff are happy to see me and that's not always the case when flying with  higher cost airlines. Terminal 5 is one of the best terminals at Heathrow and as we were connecting  with a long haul flight from Asia on another carrier we were a bit tired and travel weary when taking this morning flight. But the staff greeted us with a smile, the plane felt nice and seat was comfortable. It's bring your  own entertainment and you'll have to purchase both food  & drinks. Which we found to be comparatively good value for money and quite good. I like the  friendly service touch.  BA manages to  look both nice and efficient. We had a nice smooth flight home to Iceland at the end of our vacation and I can honestly say that I'm looking forward to  the next flight  on BA."
8.0,"I was a  tad nervous when  we booked my  Qatar Airways return  trip from London  via Tokyo, but  overall had a  very pleasant experience. The flight attendants were lovely, attentive,  polite and sweet.  Normally a nervous  traveler so I tend to drink  A lot and  it never felt  uncomfortable or like  someone was bothering  anyone by ordering another. The food was good, plenty  of in-flight movie  entertainment and the  flight was very  good I'm not really sure what else I could need. Also, the price of the  tickets was affordable."
4.0,"On to Mauritius.  Quite disappointed to see the decline  on quality from  airlines since I last flew with . For a flight of 11.5 hours to Mauritius,  everyone was shocked  at the quality of the economy class seats and  doubted BA seriously  considered them good enough for a long haul flight of this length. Possibly the least comfortable airline seat I've ever had, with every lump  and bump imaginable, and the infuriating headrest which doesn't stay up, slipping  off and banging  you in the neck every 15 minutes. The seat back offered no protection from the  passengers behind putting things in their seat pocket. Legroom also very poor  ( I am above average height)  so my knees were pressed against  the seat in front even before  they reclined into  seat The food was also poor. No snacks offered,  and the meals were slop. I have flown Air , Virgin, Emirates and BA in  the last two years and BA was the poorest in terms of  quality and comfort. Good points: the cabin crew were  pretty good, toilets were clean, and the in-flight entertainment  is fine with a good selection, but that wasn't  going to save  me from being a genuinely poor ."
5.0,"Boston to Barcelona via London. I  have a silver BA card holder  and reserved two flights (myself and  the wife) from Boston to London Heathrow (in premium economy) and Heathrow  to Barcelona in Economy class. I paid for seat reservations for my  spouse on both legs as she has a bronze  membership and cannot reserve without paying. On check in at Boston we were given different seats for the Heathrow to Barcelona sector than I had reserved (in the exit row), due to a  changing of aircraft configuration. Although the booking was made months before no  further notice was  given of the change. In early June I applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and  it was given a case number.  To date there 's been no  acknowledgement or refund from BA in spite of my sending a second email asking for information. Overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly  over the past  year due to cost cutting measures. We will not be flying transatlantic with BA in the future after 7 years of several crossings each year. In an  editorial about British Airways in the Financial Times on 2nd June it said that their customers are less and less happy,  although due to increased earning from  price cutting the shareholders are very happy. Eventually they  may learn that  any loss of customers will be more important."
6.0,"Gatwick to Mauritius in business class. The check in and lounge were of a reasonable standard and the new lounge at Gatwick is nice. Boarding was fine and pre-selected seats retained. The layout and features were standard of club world and service  at the level expected. The club kitchen was fairly limited in its offerings. Half the entertainment did not work properly if at all. In short acceptable service. Flight left and  landed on time.  Perhaps BA should take note that for this route, Emirates were less  expensive and would have offered an A380 offering on  both legs. The reason for choosing  Emirates was the fact it was a direct service."
2.0,"From Heathrow to  London British Airways  were once the  national airline of  continental UK, you paid a little  bit more but the service was  always a cut above the rest. Now they have  decided to turn it into a budget airline where you have to pay extra for  everything including the  highest priced sandwiches  and they even  pay for water  and if you don't have a  card in your  luggage you have  to go without  because they don't  have cash. I  did not mind  paying that bit  less for BA  flights but now better off with ."
2.0,"London to Hong Kong in premium  Economy I have been flying BA on my many trips over the last six years, and I have seen such a shocking decline in their services that  I feel compelled to write this review. Of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. One was from Oslo to London on 9th June, when the captain decided to wait  for some Business  Class passengers who  never made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. My worst experience,  then was going to Hong Kong on 30th May, when there was  another technical fault with the plane. The captain decided to board passengers  before the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and  warning before an 11-hour flight. I was in Premium Economy, but the extra amount I paid did not offer any additional comfort. I switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that I got no rest during the night. How can Premium Economy seats be next to the toilet? The in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. I am still wondering why anybody  should pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don't recline as they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means  something bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. Predictably, the plane landed in Hong Kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for  my airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. I had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th June, but then I found out that BA had scrapped the sparkling wine , a welcome drink for Premium Economy passengers. Although this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about BA, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness. I will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with BA."
1.0,"Belfast to Munich via Heathrow. Today (4th July) I  realised I needed  to change a travel date from  6 July to  8 July.  I attempted to  manage this on  the ""Manage My "" for about  3 hours and, although I selected 4 different flight  times each time I thought my booking change was  available (at an  added cost of  £ + seat costs), I was  told that my  other flights were fully booked, even  when my booking included purchase of  items shown as  tickets (quite a few). So. I contacted BA's Customer  Service by phone and waited for about 20 minutes for an agent  and after saying hello and providing  my name, promptly lost me. So, another 20 minutes later, I spoke  through another (very  helpful and helpful)  BA agent and she told me  my only available  booking changes would  cost me almost  holding onto my £218 ticket! I  would have booked a new return  trip for a  penny less! I am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by BA  - all the work is by  hand and on-line and BA can re-sell my Friday  and the time I spent going around in circles,  only to end  up with nothing  and having to  call Customer Services; and  the  time it takes  you get though  BA Customer Services  very clearly, are  under staffed, over-worked , with limited capacity to really help. BA -  you are in serious need of a makeover and self-examination to have  customers such as  this consider using  them again and not tell everyone to avoid you and write reviews such as this."
7.0,"London Heathrow to Tallinn return. Flight on time on way out. Had changed seats to  Row 12 (emergency)  Lots of legroom and row in  front can't recline, so it was very comfortable. Bought a nondescript coffee. Good flight. The flight home was a surprise using a Qatar Airways plane and crew due to BA strike. Row 12 not an emergency row but more legroom than is standard on BA,  a better seat  for a new plane, a decent free snack and a nice small  cup of wine also free! So a good experience.  Keep up BA!"
1.0,"From Heathrow to Barcelona. I thought  Emirates would be  cheaper than a  high cost airline,  and it is ! In fact  Spain is quite worse, so if you have a cheaper option, do not hesitate to  fly with them. The flight is  delayed and they say you can 't take on board a backpack  to put under  a seat but  in the bag ! Rude people  with ridiculous rules,  poor company living  for the past ?"
2.0,"Dubrovnik to Gatwick. Poor ground service, chaotic boarding via  airport bus. No  assistance or assistance on boarding from  airline staff. The  poor service which  had become the BA norm. Forced  into fly BA by tour operator,  or other wise  has chosen a alternative airline. Most  other choices for purchase were not . Tea was lukewarm and not pleasant. Cabin staff  hostile and unhelpful, a most unpleasant  feeling"
5.0,"Welcome to London : Shabby third  class lounge in  BA Very tired  BA aircraft. Buy on board service  takes ages. Crew were funny raising  their eyebrow at BA's new low  budget carrier concept  to Europe with  an expensive buy  a sandwich on-board. BA are one rung about Ryanair , on par with Easyjet when it comes to  passenger service and . Such a  disgrace what's happened  with them. Convenient  departure times and LHR departure is as good at  is gets I'm afraid."
2.0,"London to Dubrovnik. Interesting that BA have dropped the ""to fly to  Europe advert"" Boarding was the usual  complete shambles. Selling  checked luggage only tickets only adds to the scrum in trying to place a modest size bag in the overheads. No less than three  bags came on with oversized bags. In one instance, it took 3 people to lift a bag into the overheads, coming dangerously close to dropping the bag onto to the heads of seated passangers. When complaints were made to cabin crew, the response was ""they are entitled to bring hand luggage""  the trolley sales of refreshments took an inordinate time. Most of the choices were unavailable. Cabin crew frequently  took the wrong  food and had great difficulty with the automated card payment system.. Would strongly recommend taking own food on BA short haul flights."
2.0,"Flew Accra to  London Heathrow. All  were going well  here in Accra  with an orderly  We got to  the end of  a runway when  the pilot announced  the we would  be returning to  the stand as  this was a  problem on the cargo load (I  think more loaded  than was on  our manifest). The  plane was terminated  shortly before the  crew started their  flight This then  takes an hour to sort out  more cargo being removed) - no  refunds offered (this  being business class  i reminded myself).  Right off the  runway was the  first British Airways  real world product.  Not special or  anything but at  times was not  shown so the  shouting over the  touch screen to  board did not  need to happen.  In business class  is old and  the plane (I  thought BA would  at least try  but not show  that interior is patched together with  electrical tape and  anything that looks  like grouter that  I would use  for a bathroom).  BA crew don't  really have much  on offer now  in terms of  professionalism although they  were professional if  very friendly. Must  be terrible working  at BA now  given that the product is so  different to other  major carriers. The  only entertainment is  average - for  business travellers only  with addition of  a or two  silent films, with the rest of  us chose the  following month after ). The memento  from this night  that has not  happened for years  so it is  probably due a ..."
5.0,"At Heathrow to  a Newish aircraft,  the leather seats  or very cramped  cream leather seats.  One emergency exit  area was fine  but others were very tight. BA  are now akin  of a low  budget carrier in Europe. Don't expect  much and you 'll be disappointed.  It is no different to flying  home these days."
6.0,"Malta to Gatwick.  BA is for  British Airways Catering Service Managers. They 've invested a  bit of time  and money into  their meal scheme  in as to  generate extra income  and than give  away meals. Initially  I was very impressed when I spied the M&S  food and drink menu which does  inspire appreciation. However,  in flight BA 2645 from Malta  into Gatwick my  initial feelings of happiness were swiftly  shattered I am a strict vegetarian so I was  pleased to see the selection of  beef fayre but  disappointed by the  way the trolley  came to me  (& long time  i might add)  it was no  cheese sandwiches, no  vegan focaccia, not  even mixed nuts (for heavens sake!). Of course there  is plenty for the non-vegetarians. Not only that but the Couscous Salad  had chicken on  offer but no  vegan alternative. I  was very disappointed and BA need to do better.  For me to fly with BA again I'd need  further assurances that  it will care just as much  of the veggie people as for  we meatheads. "
1.0,"Welcome to Zagreb. British Airways lost my luggage on the 20th June and here I  was on the 30th still trying  and get some information. We came across the most ridiculous customer service agent on the 21st who advised us we were unauthorised to be enquiring about the claim because we weren't providing the correct information. When we asked him what information was  correct he would  just proceed with our call. On the 6th day when we were back at the airport to fly  back we were told that the bag was delivered to our temporary address the day before, what a mess! We were told that they would try to get it on the last flight and that they  could call us, when we arrived at Heathrow we went to the customer service desk to ask where we could get some information and the lady would not even let us in the line because 'there is no such thing as a  line to follow up missing luggage, if you make a claim you need to just  call for a phone call. I never heard from anyone. We are back home now in Australia and I have just called to follow up the bag to which I was advised that the claim has been closed. Now  we need to wait for the  claim to be reopened and wait another 72hrs to get an update. Not once have we received a  call from anyone, our phone bill is over $800AUS due to the amount of calls we had to make. I suggest British Airways take  another good hard look at how you treat your  employees who spend a hell of a lot of money to fly with your airline and take in to some consideration how you would  feel being on the other side of the world with no luggage for 10 days. Absolutely disgraceful."
1.0,"Manchester to Philadelphia.  I booked my flights through British  Airlines but the flights were American  so I booked  my gluten free  flights both ways,  using the field in the booking form that BA had provided. When the meals came round, I was  told that BA  had not passed  over my dietary requirements, and all  they could offer  me was a  pasta salad (half  chopped tomato and some lettuce). When  they landed, I emailed British Airways  and complain, and  ask them to ensure I had  my gluten free  meals on my  flight I received no reply, and  again there was  insufficient food for  me on the  flight After countless  calls I finally  received a message  advising me that  even though British  Airways had a  form on their  website to ask  about my dietary  preferences I should  of contacted American  Express to request . British Airways  could pick and  choosing which information  to send to  their carrier airlines.  I told them that they shouldn't  request for information  if they don't intent to pass  on but was  hit with the same 'you should have requested it better' line. They  were truly incompetent,  at one point  even started talking about my child  - which I  already have. 0/10  bad customer service."
10.0,"I landed from  our second of  two flights in  June between London  & Kuala Lumpur ; on both legs, the experience  is exceptional. Chose seats 1E and 1F on both  planes for my partner and I,  the seats were  extremely well maintained, fully functioning and  extremely comfortable. Ground ing at T5 is a vast  upgrade with the new First Wing;  checked through quickly  and met by  friendly staff, with  warm and professional service in the Concorde Room. Golden  gate at Kuala  was less inspiring  with staff very  helpful and nice  breakfast menu. Onboard , staff on  two legs were  incredibly friendly, intuitive,  efficient and good  company and they  worked out of their way to accommodate our dining . Flowers in the bathroom (which  were kept clean,  for a second ) would be helpful as had  to wait at  tables and amuse ments provided. Plenty  more wine, no shortage of food , nothing ran  late - my  room was never  touched and the  staff knew when  they make the bed up without having to ask.  These flights reminded  us why we  stay with BA  to remain loyal  towards them."
2.0,"Flight to London Heathrow. Three bags belonging to self  and colleague checked 26 June at Frankfurt on the  last flight to  Amsterdam 2.5 hrs  long flight. Flight arrived in London  45 mins late) and 1 of  the bags appeared on carousel (a business flight with  absolutely no checked  bags on it). Courteous Customer Service  Manager in Baggage  Department took details  but noted that ""Baggage had not  fully loaded"". Promised that bags would  been sent on  the flight the next day and should be delivered to our office by 12.00 noon.  Missing and still waiting for delivery at 1510 three days later. How  or why 1  out of 3 delivered, and why  4 hours for  deliveries"
1.0,"British Airways business class Heathrow to Accra as the BBC reported ""The most delay-afflicted route.  123 out of 122 - or 70% - of flights on this route were delayed  by over 30 minutes last summer"". As a regular on this route I can verify these unacceptable delays. Indeed my flight the delay was,  per usual, over an hour. The  ONE World product is now very  outdated and worn - no updates to it despite the constant updates  by other carriers. The BA crew were fine, but  never given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines. Usual chaotic boarding process for  this flight - the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage, but always  boards the plane with only thirty minutes to departure. It will never  work on this routing. When will BA learn? The seating in the  new BA format for business class  is just not keeping up with other airlines - including One World members like Qatar, American or Royal Jordanian. The constant  attempts to lower the divider between seats to serve  is both rude and poor service. The comfort is now more akin to Ethiopian Airlines on their older aircraft rather than  something expected of BA. The LHR-ACC-LHR  format is a  loss maker for BA - they use their old and tired aircraft on the route and milk it for all it is worth. Air France and KLM  could offer a better business class service on this route. A great shame to see one of the previously great airlines go down and down in standard."
1.0,"From Heathrow to  London I haven’t  actually taken this  laptop yet and  i am totally  confused I have  travelled with British  Airlines 3 times  outside of Manchester  but on each  of the aircraft  has had technical  problems and this  also caused me  the miss my  longer haul connecting  flight On this  occasion I have  decided to drive  myself to London  today to avoid  the issue and  fear there will  come a strike!  I telephoned BA  emergency service today  too ask about  my laptop situation,  after pressing many  times I was  assured all the  flights are busy  or cut off. I will never  take a flight  from BA again,  but if this  happens I have  another long layover  or connection time.  British airline is  in national disgrace ; the British  industry should be  expelled from the  skies If I  am on the  news I will  have you know  how it is!"
1.0,"On the 13th June 2017 I travelled from Mykonos  via London Heathrow  in BA 651. If British airways  where trying to compete with budget  flights they are failing dismally. We  got two hours into a four hour flight before  the refreshment trolley reached us only  then be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to . All we were offered was a packet of  two or a packet of two . This flight left around lunchtime . I would have thought it would be obvious there would be  no large demand  of something to eat. To add to the problems  of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation. If there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with. I have today received a telephone call from  BA following my  previous complaint which  has served no purpose. It was  another case of  frustration but we are working to  maintain the service which doesn't help me. A service which was very good before the cost cutting.  'We fly to serve' I somehow don't think so anymore. Easy jet, Ryanair and other  budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles. I cannot  consider flying with  BA again."
2.0,"I was flying back from Zurich to Heathrow after  the visit to see my son. We arrived in time at the airport. Check in was quick and friendly. But once  you got through security the trauma of BA began. A 2 hour delay on the screen. Why didn't  they tell us at check-in? Yes,  we did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day. Once the boarding began all was  fine until we  landed on one of BAs old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever . No welcome.  The seats were  empty and uncomfortable.  Before taking off the Captain explained the delay had been due to  a faulty door. The door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence  the seats were empty. A strange explanation and comforting  for anyone who had a fear  about flying! When  the food service came I was  disappointed but my  apologies they ignored her. When we did arrive at Heathrow T5 we  wound up at  the C gates,  thus adding another  20 minutes or so. Based on this I will no longer pick BA as a preference. The brand once the favourite airline is no . "
1.0,"Rome to Heathrow  Airport on the 23rd June delayed  taking off over 6 hours due to technical fault. Minimal information and absolutely no customer service or support. No refreshments provided.  The only information we received was when the captain  asked of the  aircraft to tell  me what was happening, he was  the only one who cared. BA support and service  for Rome was  non existent. After take off the  cabin crew came around with their  cups of drinks and unbelievably I  have to pay £2.30 for a cup of tea despite a 6 delay with no  tea provided. BA  are now an overpriced budget airline with no service focus, actually thats  down to budget  airlines who provide much better service.  BA has lost  their plot."
3.0,"London to London.  What a mistake,  I selected this route for a  million reasons, I  wanted to try the new British  Boeing 787 in  business class and  good timing. But  really have nothing  good to say  on the whole . The lounge at Chennai was  empty but at  home it was  just the gate.  Getting aboard the plane we discovered that instead of  seats I think  would be standard  BA Business class , is no direct aisle access  to the Window  Seat and if  seated in the  window seat you'll  see people climbing over your legs  to access the aisle and the  people leaning over  them to serve the person in the window seat, the layout is quite crazy. The seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but  with how BA  have crammed them  all in that's  another issue. I  took the window seat and initially  just found it  fine but as  it was a very long all  day flight I  have to dim  my window and  reach the point  you can only  see them down,  There is no blind, the sun still shines through,  this I accept  is like looking  at very dark Sun glasses but it's not possible  and cut out the light as  you get with blinds. I understand several other airlines  have retro fitting  curtains on the  planes but this  was a major  mistake by Boeing.  That was my  first flight on  the 787, both  are 11 hour  haul flights, the  only one I  took was at  Bangalore so no  problems with the  blackout blinds. I've not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of  the aircraft I find myself just  so tired after  every flight as  you would be on any other aircraft. I'm a long term supporter  to BA and  just so upset that BA are going backwards, focusing  the profits and ripping off the customer. Sorry BA but there are  too many good  aircraft out there , for your  customers please wake up and start  giving service to  people not just  fly them in  but take the  money because it 'll last, people  like me will  move on."
4.0,"From London Gatwick to Genoa with British Airways. Fast  check in at  the smart new premium area at Gatwick. Brand new lounge was really comfortable and with  a great selection of food, drink  & magazines, access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal I realize that nothing can  get done about  this The gate  closing was only  about 20 minutes  close to the gate closing and it was 20 minutes away at  a fast pace, especially as there was a queue  to exit the lounge by the two elevators. On  landing our Club  Economy seats that we had paid  extra to choose,  one that no other airline that  i know of  offered with a full Business Class fare, was behind  a curtain. Overhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 Club  Class passengers had  just put their  luggage further back  in the economy  cabin without assistance. An engineer was called to try to move the  bin and curtain back but it  got stuck and  was between rows 2 and 3 with our seats  still in row 3. My special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was  served for the short flight. Leg room was atrocious . Business Class  premium seats are the same as economy. Because the curtain could not be drawn, the Business Class toilet  was used by Economy Class passengers and at times  those passengers had  the queue behind them. Given the high expectations following  my experience on  the ground the  service was not up to standard  and the service provided despite these lapses was great.  Had to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at Genoa Airport. In  reality this was not a Business Class quality flight, we should have  been economy for a quarter of the price."
2.0,"Flew British Airways from Beijing to London Heathrow. The cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. Cut  corners are evident  - from the small and very  thin hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other than with other airlines on china and warm - this might seem a small niggle, but it is indication of  how saves costs - by annoying their premium cabin customer). The amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke really. To be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other One World members (Royal Jordanian and Qatar for example). Flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should  do more than that. The offering within the flight  has to be competitive and regain some ground. Was presented, at the second meal serice, with frozen pawns on bread (returned and a de-frosted plate came by return). Unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea - but no effect as yet. Part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight,  we covered it up with a spare blanket. Despite there being enough toilets for Club World passengers there was often a line of people waiting from World Traveller Plus - snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. No control of passengers from World Traveller Plus coming in to the Club World cabin. Toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so I ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. Lovely. Shame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels."
5.0,"Flew British Airways from Corfu to London Heathrow. Food service a joke. I have never  written a review on anything in my life, but  how can an airline like British Airways spend probably millions of pounds setting up a new food paying  service by using an antiquated system  with the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and  check they have entered the correct number of items instead of using barcodes? Unbelievable if the company has become so badly managed, (how many  failed to come up with this decision?) that common  sense is lost in corporate nonsense. Apart from that, flight great, but sorry BA please  realise your mistake  and put this right. "
1.0,"Back to Santorini. We were at  our gate when  they cancelled our  tickets We could  only get booked on another flight and we got told to go home without our luggage. It took  them 4 days to return it.  They will not reimburse us the cost of the  flight at £1,200 or the cost of the hotel  at £2,000. This is a total . How can they be allowed  the do that?  Consult with another airline to ensure you actually arrive. Never experienced such bad customer service and refusing to refund our money  seems outrageous."
8.0,"Flight to Durban , London /  Birmingham Check in at Leeds was  smooth Security was slow, so fast track was appreciated. Boarding was relatively quick and flight departed early. Seating  is reasonably comfortable but cramped, and service is basically  non existent unless one is prepared  the pay for  it Transfer at Heathrow was a  breeze surprisingly with  a further security check. Boarding commenced in good time  which was quick  but smooth onto the upper deck,  and a pleasant greeting from the  crew The premium economy cabin is very pleasant with  generous seat width  and legroom. The seats are comfortable, but both our  seats were faulty.  Mine would not  remain upright and  the wife's would  barely recline. Unfortunately  BA did not realise the extent of the problem  immediately and only reported it next  week We were  upgraded to business  only - we should have reported  this immediately! Sparkling  wine and fruit  juices were offered before take off,  although the quality  had been hit by cost savings. Bar service followed quickly after take off, but again the quality of  drinks was average  - not up  with the standard  offered by other  passengers in premium economy. We both  had beef fillet  as dinner - alternative was chicken - which was  tasty and served  with proper crockery with decent cutlery. Breakfast next morning  was economy class fare with plastic cutlery, which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down  on standard and  raises questions whether the cost saving  is really worth  the negative impression ! The A380  felt very quiet  and most passengers  going to sleep.  We were several  taxi runs during  that night, and  all cabin crew  were quite active. Arrival was on  schedule and everything went smoothly. The  direct connection to  Delta with BA franchise, Comair, was  the reminder of the difference between  travelling in South  Asia and flying  in Europe. More  comfortable and full  breakfast on a one hour flight."
7.0,"We had an  early morning flight  via London Heathrow  from Dublin to  visit a memorial  service in Ireland.  The check-in process  appeared to have  an automated and  i am not  surprised I saw  some elderly Chinese  couple struggle with  the computers and  two uniformed staff  member in BA  just walked away  but ignored them.  Security intervened and . The interior  in the aircraft  looked spotless. However,  there was no catering per se  other than a  quick buy Marks  & Spencer items. No cash was  allowed and the  seats were very  low The cabin  crew were lovely people and deserve  more than to  see the name  as a once  mighty national carrier  due to such  poor miserly product.  I was punctual."
4.0,"Bangkok to Luxembourg  via London. Premium economy on British  Airlines is disappointing.  This Bangkok to  London route is  dominated by B777  aircraft that look  when they've seen better days. Boarding  is chaotic on  all outward and return flights. Seats are old and  generally not very  comfortable and with  little recline. The IFE is poor in terms of choice, the screens are the smallest I've ever seen,  and the sound quality is very  low The food served is ok.  Service on board during the outward leg was perfunctory but excellent on  my return leg,  with the cabin attendant who served me being a  big credit and  asset to the airline. The short haul flights between  London and Luxembourg  (+ economy) were good. It's time for British Airways  better pull up  its socks if it wants to compete with the leading Asian, Middle  East airlines, or even the better European ones."
1.0,"London Heathrow to  Paris Orly. I have been a gold member of BA over 25 years making approx 100 flights per  year We have  been through ash  and strikes, IT breakdowns and weather , of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace.  We didnt think  BA could get  better but it did. Arrived at the airport and my app said  On time, screens  said on time but my independent  airline app said  two hours delay. In the first class lounge I  got told short  notice Knowing how inaccurate BA can be I asked to speak to special services. One hour later I  asked again. I  encountered an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty, take  her up with Alex Cruz and  they were more important flyers like  family and celebrity.  That is how I felt after 25 years of Gold guest list. She then told me the flight was cancelled and said I would have to either  book the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .Staff  should know how to get people out of the  lounge and despte ing on time for Charles De Gaulle no alternative was offered. I had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and  instead beg BA for a refund which they tried to sidestep. The moral of this story is when  my gut tells  us trust has  to believe it and at BA  it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the CEO.  The other interesting fact is I  didnt look at  BA before booking including Easy jet <100 pounds Air France 500 pounds and foolishly I felt loyalty meant something. Not at this airlin . The salt in  this wound is that Easyjet and AF got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on  both flights are  having a good  working day in . It is incredible that one  man who carry's the British flag  became such a disgrace. I am sure that a small percentage are  disappointed but looking at the chaos and disbelief in the lounge last  week echoes the most common phrase  used in airline speak. What has happened to BA and we wont fly them again."
1.0,"Flew New York  JFK to Copenhagen  to Heathrow. Have  a Premium Economy  ticket on Cathay,  Air Lufthansa and  Air France. By far, British Airways is the worst! World Traveler Plus  definitely means Plus  and everything else  was downhill. Seats  are cramped, recline  for a few , food awful, sorry but that is the best adjective to describe what was served. Amenities practically non-existent and wrapped in  one tube of toothpaste (if only the cap would open) could only  meet brushing requirements  for half a  pair of teeth, no covers for  your headphones. Totally  inadequate for the  price paid and shaming the word Premium Economy. Before I forget, the  Customer Service was confusing, calling colors  like Silver, Sapphire, etc. People just  cutting the line and the staff losing their voice,  yelling for order. Why not just  go the way you sell -  Premium Biz, Premium,  Premium Trying too hard to be  Great"
1.0,"From London to Hamburg. I cannot believe that an airline like British  Airlines have to  fight with the likes of Ryanair  and EasyJet and stopped complimentary cabin  boarding - no drinks, no snacks. They should be  proud of themselves  and put themselves a class on  flights with low cost airlines.  I am now cofused why I 'd ever fly British Airways vs  Low Cost Airlines.  i was recently  there flying on Club World. My luggage was tagged ! But waited  on arrival for over 30mins - non priority bags came out mixed with priority - British Airways policies  and operations are clearly confused and it's losing its  place as a  much reknowned airline.

3.0,"British Airways charges a big premium for Premium Economy. I sat on the top floor of the A380 after being upgraded from World Traveller at the gate, and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from Singapore to London Heathrow. There were two dinner  options chicken tikka  or beef fillet, but as I dozed off I missed out. So no food until 1 hour before landing (11 hours later) unless I wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card. I kindly asked for some water, got some orange juice too - didn't want to push it even  though I saw a bottle of  wine open in the galley - not worth the risk of a bad reaction. I  would recommend this cabin based on the high prices they charge. The staff mean well - however a gulf of enthusiasm exists between them an Singapore Airlines, Qatar, Cathay etc. It's not cultural, it's just indifference. Will continue to book BA for cheap economy (product/service offers almost no difference) and enjoy upgrades where given."
2.0,"Singapore to London.  I have started  doing take British  Airlines as it's  my corporate requirement.  The Business Class  (& World) is  more like Premium . The seats  feel small and  cramped especially with the layout for  a passenger sitting  next to the  bed - you  were basically trapped  there and you'd have to disturb the other passenger  or get out.  Unfortunately the ""bed""  does not extend fully so it  is creatively a makeshift ""fold down  stool - if  I apply too much pressure on that stool, it  twists itself and  begins to break off from the  bed - it's  very flimsy! The food is very  bad quality and  extremely bland - I have already  had the regular  meals and special ity - don't ! The service  was poor with  the crew that  is  not  able to provide for the comfort of business class . Overall, I  am very disappointed.

7.0,"Today was my first flight from Toronto to London crewed by ""Mixed ""! Easy check-in at Toronto Pearson (The BA ground staff are always great in Toronto) with fast track meant I was in the lounge  20 mins after arriving at the airport. The lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited  white wine list. Still too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. Easy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now  limited to London. (used to be only ex London). Fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. An OK Chicken  sandwich was served  but I still don't see it as Biz class ! A choice of whites and reds wine was  provided which reinstates the previous one of each. That is where the improvements ended. The morning offering of a cereal bar and T&Cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little BA care about the entire journey customer experience. The crew on this flight were great. Young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. A request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! The return flight was less good. Drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (Crew member's first flight since qualifying) It took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a WTP tray. The underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and T&C. Customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. This cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours I need something more substantial than chocolate. Service reduced - yes, price reduced  and no! The 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of WTP, the IFE screens are tiny. Mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. However, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. What these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of Long Haul crew - I hope they relax into the role soon! At least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut I admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show BA have listened. However, the second meal <mask> both directions being cut on east coast US / Canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. The jury remains out on whether I continue my loyalty to BA and One World - it really depends on what BA do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a <mask> service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline <mask> which point - I'm off)."
1.0,"I arrived at London Heathrow in transit with a  US Airways flight  connecting to another BA flight. The  flight was there, still boarding, my  luggage was checked-in for my final  flight but I wasn't! They forgot to check me  off for my full journey at departure. They didn't let me board, and made me stay overnight. I have never seen  this level of  such bad management and poor service."
2.0,"The crews on both the outbound and inbound flights from Johannesburg to  Bangkok were very  much unprofessional, and  totally missing the  good character and wit that used to make the British Airways crews  unique and outstanding. They were basically (on both flights)  sleeping through the service and not  even be seen  in the next  two hours before  their breakfast service. On both flights,  the was no water offered during  the night, which is really a  problem considered the price difference between economy and premium.  The meals were overcooked, and on both flights the knives could not  cut through the ""best of British Beef"". Given that the hot meals are the same  price in Club (according to BA's marketing), I would have been furious if being offered this quality of food in Business ! A perfect example of unprofessionalism  among the crew  came when I got up after  lunch and went  to the galley (as nobody cared  or answer the bell) and asked  about a Baileys: the young attendant  glanced at her coworker and asked her what a Baileys was, and  an answer came ""sorry Sir, we don't have that  type of wine.  Would you like some white?"" I  am missing the  good old BA and will take  my business to some other reputable airlines in the  future even if it means paying a few hundreds more."
5.0,"Flew Valencia to London Gatwick with British Airways. Check in was a bit disorganised as  the check in for business class had a problem with the computer so this caused a delay. Security was a bit slow (no fast track). Business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor, note this is not a BA lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a local partner. Boarding was a disaster, we were called to board but then waited on the air-bridge for  about 20 minutes.  The air-bridge was made of glass and was full  of people and  we soon became very uncomfortable as there was no  heating or ventilation and some people seemed close to passing out. Eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane (apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy). There was no communication from the ground  staff which although not BA staff  reflected badly on the airline. Once we were finally on-board the flight was trouble free.  Great service. Hot meals served but  some pasta we chose was not very pleasant. Plane arrived only 10 minutes late having made up a lot of time from the initial delay. priority baggage worked as our case was on the carousel as soon as cleared passport control. Would have been a nice trip back bar the problems in Valencia airport."
2.0,"London Heathrow to Edinburgh return, possibly my last BA flights. I used economy (or maybe  to be re named) economy minus outbound and returned in Club Europe, checked in online however 4 of the 5 checking  out kiosks were not working at T5 so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk. Security quick I'm a BA/Oneworld sapphire member so used the North lounge which was okay. Flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late. A320, seat 11A an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board. Return check in quick as was security, the BA lounge  on EDI has been the same for a few years now. It's at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff. Boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late. Club  Europe on domestic flights is a new introduction. Actually  it replaced what  was BA economy class. A cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers? The aircraft was pretty full so some people like BA although I suspect many passengers were transferring at LHR. Service was okay food economy standard although included in the price. Arrival at T5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags. I fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90% on long haul flights. I have supported BA in the past although I've not used them  short haul for about 17 months. Basically they are not good enough. Cut backs and  poor service is evident. I expect security comfort and some service when paying £2500+ for a business class ticket. Qatar, Cathay and even SriLankan offer better service. On reflection I fly business class on most flights so I don't actually need any frequent flyer status. The cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits. I might fly BA in future as a  very last resort or to use  up the miles I've earned. But my loyalty will be my wallet in future. Bye BA."
8.0,"Flight to Valencia in an A319 in Club Europe. This was the  first time we had flown British Airways since the move to the south terminal, check in was quick and progress through security also without . BA lounge was busy but  with plenty of seating available. Refreshments in the lounge  provided but nothing special. Boarding on time, cabin crew  at Club Europe were very pleasant  and efficient as I always find with BA. Meal  is surprisingly good  for a relatively short flight, three courses quite tasty including smoked salmon  and Thyme Roasted  Salmon for main course and chocolate cheesecake, washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne. Note BA no longer use miniature bottle and  wine as required  only proper sized bottles. Cheese and  wine a bit sad and the cracker were soft. Plane landed ahead of schedule but priority baggage didn't work and our cases was about the last through. Overall a good flight."
6.0,"Go to Rome  via London. There are no substantial  improvements to the  fares offered by a low-cost airline:  no free food/beverage, little leg space,  lots of seets only for extra , etc. However, the price I paid was at a low-cost level  as well, so the value for  money is OK."
1.0,"Its cost cutting beyond belief. Dirty  and uncomfortable seats,  where entertainment is  something that would  never existed in  the 80s, has been the same  for several years.  No meal choice (meat). either one meat or veg.  Every empty cabin across the entire  airport ran out  for alcohol too.  They have and  is continuing to cost cut, but  still haven't cut their prices to  reflect this. I  would seriously fly  anywhere else. Enough is enough, you've had my 15 years of loyalty , exec club  members or not,  pay off -  i will advise  you to do the same. I 'd give a  2 out of  1 the 1 % purely for  any cabin crew  that are embarrassed by what is now Budget Airways."
3.0,"London Heathrow to Madrid. An absolute third world experience once I got  on the plane. Check-in and lounge  facilities were great, but once I got onboard it became obvious how  worn out some of the 767 aircraft are. There were seats with missing backs and  ' Not Occupy' covers in front  seats beside them, random bits of  aircraft wiring hanging  down from rails in the overhead, and grimy, yellowed  carpet around most of the cabin interior. You have  to worry about  damage going on  the important bits, like the engines, if the same  treatment is applied  on the aircraft  or in the  cabin The crew  spend as much time as they  could in the galley, and interacted  to passengers as  quickly as possible.  Their breakfast service was a salt-infused hot cooked offering,  and just one  bottle of drinks. Anything else you  needed you had to use the call button. The  main and only reason I booked  this cabin was that it was actually just a few pounds more expensive on the  first ticket routing I'd bought."
8.0,"Gatwick to Alicante.  The wife, my son (4) and me all flew  in Euro Club  On our way to Alicante, for some reason when  booking Club it  was the same  seats as normal so it was  really no brainer.  My son has autism so we  had the quite  frankly amazing way  to start our  journey as he  seemed very calm , The staff  of BA were  extremely friendly before and on the  plane which was a nice touch. Club Euro is  a decent service  if you pay  a little extra,  your lounge is a nice start then the extra  room is nice  off the plane,  but a shame  when all the  airline reviews point out the seats are the same  it would be  nice to have slightly more legroom"
1.0,"Flight to Antigua.  a frequent flyer  on BA for  over 15 years,  in exec club,  I have seen  fares steadily decline  at this airline  especially over the  next 18 months  after Alex Cruz  takes over. my  husband and I  travel regularly in eco/prem and club  based on prices, so have seen  the decline across all classes. recent  flights to Antigua  from LGW was . A pretty  decent cabin, filthy  in the word,  as in flight  lounge (Rockwell) that  has changed in  recent years easily.  The choice is  now longer a  buffet its a  pasta dish or  some alcoholic beverages  are loaded at  BA (LGW) for  two legs, so  passengers have now  lost what they  were stocked previously.  4 hours into  flight there was  two spirits left . bearing in  that only one  glass had been  purchased prior to  a meal service 1.5 hours in to the flight.  They state in  the motto ""to  fly to serve"".  So they certainly  are flying, but  almost certainly not serving. The cabin  attendants are ashamed  and embarrassed at  price cuts which is evident in  their conversations at  in back of the aircraft, and  to anyone who  spoke to them  they are disgusted  at what the  management have done. They have cheapened  a brand of the national carrier, but haven't cheapened  their prices. easyjet , Ryanair offer  cheaper and on  the haul its  back to the  US I will now fly Virgin  amongst others, again , more for  the money in  all aspects of  this flight. Stop  attempting to make  your budget, we  want it back  is how it  ought to be! All I can  hope is the  apology passengers will  be receiving following  their major IT  upgrade a fortnight ago is one  part of paying  us back for  the awful attitude  and decline in  Thai Airways."
1.0,London City to  Birmingham The price  on the ticket  – £500 for a 2 hour flight - had no relationship to  our ultra-economy service  for this flight.  The aircraft was  incredibly dirty -  we wonder whether  it pays for  vacuum cleaners as other airlines don't seem to have  cleaner aircraft. In Business the seats  look identical to  economy so what are we actually paying for? There  is no place to power devices and forget WiFi  and overhead screens. In business the  breakfast was an  excellent English breakfast.  No better than  that The embarrassed flight attendants seemed to give all  those business passengers  something to take-away  and try and make up for the no-frills service.  It feels chronic under investment for years has left  them a bare-bones  airline milking short-term  profits and forgetting  all their business  trips should be more than just for 1 year.
1.0,"Best economy premium Boston-London Heathrow-Geneva. Again  all too often  a British Airways  BA flight left  less than an  hour late due  of a plane technical problem. As a consequence our  scheduled flight in  London was missed,  having to wait  for 5 hours  for LHR although  we were earlier . Since our  scheduled arrival was  booked by BA  a least 5 hours in advance  then didn't they  very least pre-book our connecting flight from LHR. Long  attempts at rebooking  with very little  satisfaction of customers. Then again flight  with LHR left  with Breakfast on  BA long haul . Service on  a short haul  flights equals those of charter flights.  Since I have  been travelling with  airlines for 25 yrs with silver  to gold status,  but will avoid  flights with BA  once and for  that let know  from me that  the airline is  really not a shadow of what it used to  be"
1.0,"Welcome to Bordeaux.  Two newish A320  with seats. The  whole buy onboard  from M&S does  NOT work! It  turns the cabin  of the entire  flight to work just about the  same economy cabin,  which some people  not even getting ! At least easyjet and Ryanair  had this down to a tee  and serve promptly.  Nothing has gone  fast and nothing  stops sad customers  and embarrassed cabin  and BA certainly isn't cutting prices  for flights. Ryanair  & easyjet offer  many similar routes  at half the  price as BA.  I know where  this will be  in my custom  in future. "
1.0,"London to Boston return in premium economy. Another very disappointing flight experience with BA. Overall a low cost experience at a premium price. Baggage drop in T5 is now self service unless you fly business or first, which feels like easyjet. Lounge was very busy and choice of food very limited.  The plane was a 23 year old B747, which seemed to be in its  original or close  to original configuration. The screen in the seat in front of my was the size  on my iphone and the choice of movies was very limited. The cabin crew was  friendly and did their best to operate in horrible  condition Food was not edible, i  tried the beef option but could not eat it. What i found truly shocking was the snack in morning of the return leg was nothing more than a muesli bar in premium economy. -Cost savings taken to ridiculous levels at BA. They have even managed to find a way to economise on the quality of the sleep  bags supplied (no more cotton or other skin friendly material on the inside but awful full nylon / polyester material and only one instead of two straps  on back). I am taking my business elsewhere and only use BA to spent the avios."
3.0,"Getting to London  with a reasonably  priced airfare. Check-in  line was quite  easy with friendly  crew member at  Newark airport who  brought my portable  battery charger from  my Departure lounge  but a bit  annoying due to  the laptop ban  and checking each  checked bag manually.  The board was  disappointing to say  very least, in  general it was  chaotic and a  little disappointing that  the British Airways  makes passengers have  to pay for  meal and drink  based products but  not overpriced). Also,  There was no  live entertainment and  the cabin crew  was indifferent. The  drinks on the  flight were also  very hard and  annoying The whole  fare offering is  pretty good compared  to other competing  carriers on this  site (who have  restrictions on many  good food and  the IFE). The  airline was more  of a low  impact carrier. I  dont think I'll  try to fly  there again unless  we have to."
1.0,"Welcome to Mumbai.  Poor customer service. I have benn trying to change my flight with them for the last three days, and they keep blaming the travel agent, even through  my ticket was issued by BA, after the meltdown on the 27th. If you get through to their India call center you might as welll hang up the phone, as they are rude and all they will do is keep blaming the  third party, will inturpt you when you are trying to speak, just awful service. Agree British airways is going downhill. Been a silver member for many years,  need to look  at another provider. Just awful customer service which BA, won't care to look into."
1.0,"I am a frequent flyer with British Airways, having held Silver membership  four years. On  another instance, I flew BA's short-haul business class. While you're essentially in  your same cabin as everyone else, you should get  your meal onboard (something I had counted on) and the seat next to you should be left empty. I fly this route around once every other week, but have been BA to long-haul destinations (Hong Kong, Beijing, NYC, D.C. and San Francisco) several times a year, my experience on this flight tallies with the  other flights I have taken this year on the same and other routes. The aircraft came in late,  as is a common occurrence with  airlines these days. Except for me, nobody in Business Class had an empty seat next to them. We were then informed  from the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been  delivered although we 'might be' able to obtain food  vouchers once we  got to LCY. In short, the product was exactly the same as Economy class but at an added premium of at least the price  of your regular economy ticket. This was complemented by slow and unfriendly check-in staff, an old aircraft, and a good hour I had spent on the phone with unaccountable and  unreliable BA customer service to work out if the online upgrade had gone through. On the whole, a number of instances  that simply add up make me feel that BA is very much  going in the wrong direction. They might be cheap, but can't and shouldn't compete with low-cost carriers or  other Asian airlines that have lower overhead costs.

"
3.0,"The wife and  i were very  pleased with our  Jet Airways flights  in Sydney to  Sydney return, flying  in economy. The  air quality, cutlery  & service was  of a much  better standard than  the airlines such  as Air New  York and Qantas  Airways we have . There are  no toilets allocated  throughout the cabin,  which are located  in the middle  of the economy cabin, quite a  short walk and  many times a  fairly long line of other passengers  trying to use , The seats  are a bit  better comfortable and  comfortable than economy  and the entertainment  on screen is  large as are  the films music  and earphones. BA  flights offer priority  check in at  home as do  many airlines. We would not fly  a BA premium  ever again, it is not worth  paying the much  higher expensive fare  for the standard  Economy fare.

"
6.0,"London to Hong Kong on a very new B777-300ER.  This was upgraded to WT+ at  first gate, owing to a full  economy and probably being an Emerald with oneworld. I can now distil  any difference in  economy with economy  to the same  thing - with  economy you will  have one amenity pack (eyeshades, socks,  just one welcome drink (""cava or "") one glass for drinking with  a first meal,  plus slightly wider  seats (1 inch), minor extra recline  1 inch) and a little extra  food as well , a meaty  option for the  final dinner (I  am vegetarian so picked the vegetarian,  this was the  same BA carby  meal from WT,  and was fine).  We enjoyed the IFE, the crew  was nice and  my flight on eworld I wouldn't  recommend a premium  ticket more than  anything for the  overall experience for this flight, or other WT+ routes.  From a service, it's not really premium economy, in  fact it's inferior  and economy offered . 5 star ."
1.0,"Flight to Dubai.  The crew, everything  was terrible. Caught up in the  chaos of BA  computer system collapse  of 27th May  - very lucky , get tickets  to flight next day. BA staff  left out to  lunch by appalling  airport management. Flight  was next day,  was excellent but  an ancient 747  did so with  an IFE. Food  on seat comfy  seats had seen  better days and  needs re-upholstering. Was  told luggage would be on board  - it was  dumped in the  middle of Heathrow  during the day  but luggage finally  turns up Wednesday - 4 days  late Compensation claim  by BA rather  the lot -  it all gets  worse BA have  had a number  of IT failures  within 12 months,  are too unreliable  to the moment , will be  no other carriers  working on this  one for a  lot of years  - I know  it has resolved  the reliability problems  but the product offering is more  improved Shame really,  they used to  work for something  but its now  back to the  customer"
3.0,"from Heathrow to Vancouver. I am  deeply disappointed by  the gradual decline. Today I flew in the upper deck of the A380. BA's business class seats, once the best in the industry, are almost the worst. The pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow. This is an unpleasant aircraft, with  4 toilets to share between 64 passengers. In business Class I think  this a poor ratio. The flight  crew were initially reasonably friendly (though I noticed no acknowledgement for being a Gold Card holder), but their interest waned as the flight progressed. It took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off  before the main  meal was served.  Our beef was cold as were the vegetables. It was actually inedible. I suspect it had just been left out. After dinner we were  half way through our 8 hour flight and I was never offered another drink. I gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of  the flight. British Airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines  we have flown ! This is a great shame. The cabin is bad, the food is awful, the flight attendants unpleasant . IFE OK. ."
3.0,"I took a  long daytime flight from Tokyo to London (about 12 hours). The Boeing 787 seemed fairly new and was clean, and the Premium Economy seat  was fairly comfortable  for a day , with good  padding although unfortunately  the is no legrest and a  small entertainment box  took up much of the foot space. The catering was really poor  which seemed to 've been affected  in cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of  some tough beef,  followed by a tiny salad which  is still frozen; there was then nothing for nine  hours (no snacks  offered anymore) until  the second hot  meal of a small chicken curry,  only served shortly before landing. A choice of drinks  were offered only  once shortly after ; during the entire remainder of  the flight the crew came around  me twice with water and juice, but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water  with nothing else (I asked for more water but the crew said  we didn't have .) By the time we landed I was hungry and thirsty, and  we would advise anyone using this  flight to bring  your own food  and drink. The crew were invisible for most of the flight. The  sound system had a very good choice although the  options seemed smaller than on some  flights Overall not .)"
1.0,"British Airways were  just awful on this flight from Heathrow to Miami.  Poor old tired ? These old aircraft are in desperate need of a refit. Seat  size screens unbelievably small. What shocked  me most is just how much BA have cut  down on their food service. No  shortage of pretzels  in the first drink serving anymore. Dinner was only two choices and  one was a vegetarian option. The chicken breast I received was laughable. I have seen  worse chicken nuggets.  It came with  an inedible salad concoction and a bread roll. The  ONLY other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for 'afternoon tea' with a miniscule scone. My advice would be to  eat before your flight otherwise you  could be very hungry. Staff were miserable and on  our return leg kept me awake all night by  singing very loudly in the galley. Unfortunately BA have  now become a  long haul Ryanair, scrimping on every little thing. Not good."
9.0,"I flew out  of terminal 5 on Saturday with  British Airways to Brussels, and found  staff to be very helpful and , we even  got a nice  conversation with a  friend as we  went up in the lift to departures. We got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous  experience behind them.  They used the  airport as we  had a silver card, and they  seemed busy, but well staffed, and  their food was good. On the  plane we took  my own home  cooked sandwiches since we really didn't  like the Marks  n Spencer prices. I bought a bottle of water close to our  flight and thought that was expensive ; but the BA on board  rate was £1.80  / bottle. I  did notice that  our flight attendants  seemed very good  at giving out  large glasses of free water. Like  you I can't get used to  how budget airways approach, it's clearly  why the staff  here are very  helpful On our return, we had  some delays due to the storms in southern England,  and air traffic restrictions. Then, we had Brussels air traffic delay due  of their system ! At all  costs the first officer kept us  all informed and we got back  to London and were parked on a good jetty  enough that we  could rush to  catch up. This delay was not  anyone s fault,  and the cabin crew on both flights were friendly  but efficient. I enjoyed the flight but hope that  they do not  need any further  delays and perhaps  think about restoring  my food and  drink again one day."
1.0,"British Airways seems  too be going  very bad to  worse On my  last Heathrow to  Manchester flight, the  cash machine didn't  recognise American credit , so the  passenger next to  us couldn't pay  with his drink.  The length of  time it took the flight attendants  and reach the  front of the  flight meant most  people weren't offered  anything to eat or drink until  20 minutes to  return The flight  crew were very  polite but you  know that they  really are fed  up and seem  genuinely embarrassed to be working for BA. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins which  appears to be  the running theme with this airline.  They are no better than the  budget airlines but  hardly anything other  that budget prices."
3.0,"Booked Gatwick to Lima return. Out sold Traveller+ (premium ), which was  just too bad.  The Club World was appalling! Seats and surround grubby. Equipment maintenance poor. Service was appalling.  Staff rushed almost  screamed at when asking what we wanted. Expected us to know how  to operate equipment. Food thrust at us not served!  Very rushed. No  change in service.  Limited choice not  just just 'what ' you want.  Unless it were  not for the flat beds overnight  this is a total waste of  money It is so sad that BA is going  to the dogs, a business is nothing without customers and BA are  having a great  job at alienating them. I will  not fly BA long haul again.
"
1.0,"Back to Johannesburg. After getting caught up in the  middle of the  bank holiday weekend  flight fiasco and  some lamentable way  in which the  issue was handled  by BA, I  boarded my flight back to the  US with some . My fears were not unfounded.  Although the aircraft  has been sitting  on JNB for most of the  day there were no delays and  flights started very  quickly I was  seat 83A (top  tier double seat)  but the leg room was no  worse than you  might find on  the Ryanair flight  into Dublin. Indeed,  due to the  placement of the  medical equipment box  under the seat,  everything was a  little more cramped.  Customer service on  BA flights really  felt terrible. I,  together with many other passengers, was treated like an  animal and I  suspect the cabin  staff would really  much preferred it  that we weren't there. I was  relegated to the  bathroom and sleep  deprivation pretty much , due, in  addition to the cabin crew gossiping  excessively about other  levels of staff.  And will do  everything I can  to avoid flying  again in the  future"
10.0,"Washington to Sofia  and London, flying World Traveller Plus premium economy to  Brussels and EuroTraveller  plus on the  short hop. Top quality service, whatever may have declined in economy class, premium economy is  as good as ever with 38in leg-room and meals (really tasty in this instance) that can be ordered in advance. The cabin crew are still the BA strength creating a relaxed, congenial atmosphere in the cabin. Smooth connections at Terminal 5 with no waiting (either way) and Tribute  of Ale available on the long  line drinks menu, and service is  the winner. (I'll admit the M&S food/drink service can  seem a bit  confusing as far as handling the payments, but works OK otherwise.) British Airways continue to  provide a first-rate travel experience, and  worth sticking with them."
2.0,"Flight to Rome  via Heathrow. I have been either BA Gold or  silver for many years , the last 2 years I was in  Italy but ensured my return to  UK that flights  are always BA , the same for my family  that visited. in  July 2016 I  went to UK  off business and had to stay  until Jul 12th, I was 3 points off retaining  the Gold if  BA had flown  out on 11 th I would 've retained Gold.  i had enquired about this before  doing the booking and was told  that will not be a problem,  but I was  quickly downgraded to Silver. I then booked a holiday  in Rome for my wife and  daughter and I was amazed that  BMI have removed  all free in flight drinks not  including a free  drop off tea ! If BA wish to behave like a budget  airline then they  should charge flight  fares comparable to  other budget airine.  BA have in the past left me stranded in  Rome for 5  weeks when snow closed Heathrow, yet BMI were still flying into Heathrow,  I have encountered  no staff on  flights in, long  waits even for Executive members. They  are no longer  living up to their acclaimed standards  and are not  yet 4 star  brand and should lose that status,  they will in future fly Brussels Airlines and Lufthansa 's Internal UK Easyjet. They are living on their past and need to start to realise with no passengers they will  only stay in  debt and with  the customers who have to use them they will  all get poor , If BA wish to be  the budget airline  then start charging  like one"
1.0,"Rome to Heathrow. Having used BA Business / Club  quite some time we always felt it was the little extra treat  we add to our holiday. It's  had a deteriorating service recently but the last trip  in and from Rome was the decider. The cabin was filthy with litter and crumbs from the previous flight on and around the seats. No nuts or nibbles and the drinks were dispensed from open bottles, the miniature wine bottles apparently dispensed with now. There was a choice of meals but  we weren't told unless you asked. The meal service no sooner served than it was being cleared away.  Sometimes we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airline. The advantages of booking club have gone, the lounges being dreadful with little choice of snacks, the priority labels mean you bags come off last, and you only get priority  seating if you scramble past the queue. Add to  that that on occasion the boarding pass will fail at security. It  should not be allowed to carry our national flag."
2.0,"It was the fist time I traveled with British Airways and I believe it will be the last. I had to reschedule my flight from Tampa to Tirana via Gatwick from December 2016 to March 2017. First, I couldn't change it online  and the 'manage your flight' option didn't work (they told me it happens some times), and I tried it a lot of times before  calling them, so I had to  pay +25$ for  booking it via phone (they took the money even though it wasn't my fault). I  had more than  50 calls from November to a day before traveling to reissuing my e-ticket. After a long wait to get connected, they took my credit card data and said they will proceed to reissuing the e-ticket and  sending it to  the e-mail, for nearly 6 months it never come  even 1 day before the flight. Every time I called they said they didn't have my cvv which  was re-confirmed every time When asked when will I  have the ticket, they said: after 10 days, which only came on 27th of March and I was to travel on 28th. Once they nearly set me to fly to Charlotte, NC, while  losing my data and cvv during one of the 50 calls I  made Besides this, the food was ridiculous, but never  forget that, the anxiety, time consumed  and the distress  I caused can't  get either bought  nor excused. How can a consolidated, serious company as they proclaim can be so irresponsible,  bad for the customer, not complying to the minimum standards? I expected soo much from them, it was a total disappointment!"
1.0,"Chicago to London  depends on British  Airways much vaunted  Cabin Service in  Economy Class. Be  aware this service  as a joke. Never mind the terrible, dated, seats facing one another,  but the BA  Customer Service mandates you eat in  an awful Biz Class lounge at  BA and then  get no dinner service on the  way This is  the monumental con. Also, imagine your  average school meal in a school  cafeteria and that is what you  were in the BA lounge at ? The food was some kind of dreadful steamed  stew that you  knew would not  satisfy your dog.  We used to imagine that long  term business and  economy class passengers were valued by  the airlines. The  US Airways business  Class product is the worst by far. Old aircraft, old seats, disillusioned crew, and simply  the most terrible  service imaginable. British  airlines hold their premium class passengers in contempt. What happened to English  hospitality and manners?"
1.0,"Gatwick to Funchal. British Airways has won the race  to the bottom. Leg room on this flight was appalling - worse  that Ryanair. I  cannot understand why  - free food on 'short hops' but this flight was four hours. I wonder just  how we gained  from a 'full "" airline. Our  previous British Airways  trip was on a Gatwick 777  and they are  bringing an extra 50 seats to these planes. With  their recent IT  upgrades they have  taken the bottom  and don't need  us do anything else!"
1.0,"I am shocked about how the First Class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting  by what is supposed to be our national flag carrier. On our flight to Tokyo  recently from London Heathrow we were advised by the Cabin Crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were 'limited'. To cut a long story short, this meant that my partner, who was the last to be served, was told what was available rather than asked  how he would like. This is in spite of  us being only  4 passengers in the 8 seat cabin. For breakfast prior to landing, we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served. The presentation of  the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description BA uses for its First  Class catering. We spoke to the Cabin Services Manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has  been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new CEO who comes from low cost sister airline Vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. The famous First  Flight Tasting Menu  passengers enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board  services is very evident - even the rose in  the First Class  menu was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that BA has ! I fly regularly long haul with KLM & their new Business Class offering is now far superior  over BA's First. How can our national airline, with whom we should be proud to fly, compete with other superior European & Gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers? The Cabin Services Manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 May. Almost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, BA have not responded, probably due to  further administrative cost cutting. I should add that the ground service at Heathrow T5 &  The Concorde Room were very good but as regards on board service, BA offends their premium passengers like this at their peril."
2.0,"Flying Cheapskates. Business class flight in  Northern Europe' from Luxembourg to London  which is beyond a joke, and clearly on a shoe-string budget. No pre-meal drink offered. Limited selection of drinks, with wine served in plastic screw-top mini bottles warm with no  heat Meal selection consisted of a chicken salad/prawn (which looked reasonably nice however I'm allergic to seafood) or  soft toasted cheese ! The roll was dry, tasteless and completely unsatisfactory, could have easily bought something better at Greggs. Crew could clearly be  seen bad mouthing their CEO over the airlines recent  technical 'problems'. Friendly crew though - can't help but feel sorry for them."
1.0,"Geneva to Dallas  via Heathrow. I  checked online and confirmed I had two bags of allowance to check  in with my  first economy seat purchased. However, when I went to  the airport to  bring in the luggage BA insisted  that I only  needed one bag allowance and I had to pay. I had no other choice so  just paid. I  spoke with BA  at Heathrow and they confirmed I  needed two bags.  Now I will  need to go through sending the customer service a  statement to get  my refund. Not happy that their  policy is not in coordinance with each other."
3.0,"Choose a budget , the magic of our national carrier has gone. We have always chosen British Airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher  premium for the once great service but now it's on par or lower than other low cost carriers. Firstly we didn't get any priority boarding with our two young children. EasyJet provides this. Secondly, we reserved seats as travelling with our two children, they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows. On boarding we were told the plane has changed, therefore we now had assigned seats. Thirdly, after paying over £10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife I needed the loo, first  class was out  my bounds. So the only option the rear of the plane, however the crew were busy serving and  not prepared to move to allow me past (I guess those drinks they were selling had the BA executive team seeing  me ££££ so me being a customer needing the  bathroom was second in priority). After a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past, but once out they had gone back to the middle of the  plane A crew member at the back galley even laughed and said  were not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea. Our flight from Heathrow to Bergen was only an hour and 40, but I spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member. The  first flight the  cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80  year old grandmother and technology. The safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off, the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof, asked the crew -  cabin crew, seats for landing"". The captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for  most rest of the flight, even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with 'that landing'. All minor points, but  these were the points we enjoyed with BA, points that made us choose them, small  moments that made the difference. The pilots at the  end of the  plane welcoming or thanking the customer , us thanking them, the cabin crew that always went over and beyond. The free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get, I'd rather pay a premium for all that or choose a  different airline. Gutted our British Airways national carrier has become a budget airline. Perhaps cost savings are needed, but for now, <mask> we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture, they need to cost save some more to <mask> up our <mask> tickets and my recommendations are now also dead. For me their <mask> was their service, without that there is no longer a point."
3.0,"The Heathrow to Seoul return. I  booked my return flights back in  May when BA  were having their  flight sale for  about £1700. Thought  it was a  steal as they are usually up around £3000. London to Seoul flight was very pleasant. Didn't get to  experience the business  flight lounge in  Korea as my connection from Manchester  was delayed by  45 minutes. Cabin  facilities on the actual flight were excellent and very  good Food and  beverage was what  I would expect  from most business  travel airlines with  the decent amount  a high-quality menu ! The seat layout of 2-3-2 B seats facing  in the opposite  way to each  others and a  space between them  is a little  more cramped. The  seats were very  comfortable and went flat which is better than some,  however there is a fold-down seat/step in front of  you that you  need to use  when able to  spread out fully.  At 6'0 and  over I was  reaching my limit  for being able  too stretch out fully so anyone  taller than that  could probably be a bit uncomfortable.  The entertainment had a decent range of tv and  films to choose from including some  from the more  recent releases. Toilets  were also smaller  but more cramped  compared on other  planes that I've  used business class  on before. The only let down  being that the  seat itself was  smaller than the  lounge and I found it difficult  for sleep because of this. Seoul  vs London was what really let  me down for  me and left  a sour note  on what was  another amazing 3  months in Korea.  In the days  leading up to  my flight, BA's  infamous IT Failure""  caused the lack  in information and  security surrounding it , I was having to frantically  see if my  ticket would be  available at all,  despite the flights  of the 27th  and 28th being  cancelled completely. Luckily  I got it  back in the  wee hours of the morning on  that day of  our flight. The flight and cabin  crew arrived late  to the flight , so take-off was delayed by 30 minutes. I had a connecting  train to catch to Manchester so  that was imperative  that everything went  well as I  was just over  an hour after  schedule to make  it The flight  was lovely with  great cabin crew  having an amazing  experience The pilots managed to make  excuses for lost  time and so  only ended up  being 5 minutes  longer than scheduled.  Unfortunately due to  the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the  past couple of  months there was  another flight in the space where  BA was supposed  too park. This  meant a delay of 20 minutes  while we waited on the tarmac  before the space  had become free.  There was time <mask> could not <mask> to lose. <mask> eventually disembarked at 14:45 which <mask> I had <mask> sprint through the airport to <mask> control and <mask> the baggage <mask> Really wish <mask> hadn't as <mask> still took <mask> minutes for <mask> bags to <mask> off the <mask> By the <mask> I had <mask> all this <mask> gone through <mask> it was <mask> and the <mask> was closing <mask> 10 mins. <mask> to BA <mask> services and <mask> rebooked on <mask> flight back <mask> the IOM <mask> I live) <mask> London City <mask> they could <mask> book me on the 14:50pm <mask> the next <mask> Wasn't at <mask> happy with <mask> experience overall <mask> of this and for what <mask> would normally pay (over £3,000 <mask> not on <mask> it really <mask> worth the hassle for me <mask>"
4.0,Los Angeles to  London British Airways has one of  their worst customer  experience you can  imagine Flight attendants  were rude. Seat  & food are  ok but I  find them worse than competitors flying this route. They  do have wifi.
2.0,"From British Airways  to Heathrow to Geneva. Cheapskate airline ! Only tap water available, everything else needs credit , American family with hungry young boys couldn't buy anything for them  on their machine  would take US . Return flight cancelled after 4  hrs on tarmac with the IT crash. Staff brilliant, including pilot who  had ac on , updated us  all as much as he could. Then BA ticket  was unmanned in Geneva airport, so  were just standing.  we were lucky to find swissair flight home or  you think we'd still be there!"
6.0,"Return to Lima return in Business Class. No choice of seats until  right before the flight unless you  paid extra (I understand their desire to reward frequent  customers but paying  less per flight if you aren't  was just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). By the  time we were able to check in, there was  only one option  left if we wanted to sit together. New BA lounge at LGW smart but packed out at the start of Easter holidays. Limited food  choices at breakfast  - no hot food at all, unless you count  their pastries. FA service on flights in both directions  very good, though  unfortunately the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services, despite it being a day flight. Food and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time  I got to . Seating layout of 2-4-2 in  first class is very cramped, especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating I've ever experienced in business - and there was  a surface to put anything on  if you had  your tray table ! Small drawer  between your feet. Recommend the window  ledge next to  your bulkhead if you're travelling solo - no legs to climb over!  Economy seat was  comfortable though for  the short person. IFE was poor  compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen  and with a limited choice of movies available. On the way home , didn't mind  a long layover at LIM as we thought we 'd use the  airport No such  thing - we couldn't be checked in all the  time through from  Lima so had  another pick up , go through immigration again and  wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in  our flight home. Only seat choice available again were  seats together on the aisle side of a middle pair. Very fortunate  not to have  been in the  same middle seat next to me, otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a  perfect stranger! Haven't travelled long-haul with BA for several  weeks and can  honestly describe it as a functional, value service, even  on Business, though  definitely not cheap.  Will only use BA again if they were the  least convenient by a long way (as happened here  on a direct  flight from London), or for a  good price on short-haul. There's really  zero comparison to  the long-haul offering  of Business.

5.0,"London Heathrow to  Naples We flew with 6 of our family to Santorini, the business class seats are a joke I am 6'3"" but I just could  not move in the seats they are so tight.  I then learnt from the steward that it's a new configuration that hasn't gone down very well with customers. This once great airline that's gone from the best to the worst in 5  months and on European routes it's no more than a budget carrier, money is the key driver for BA with customers very last on the list. We all felt we 'd paid for a service we never received."
2.0,"Between Heathrow to  London I fly  British Airways a  good amount mainly  as pleasure. But  now they are  continuing to slip. My last flight  was with two  people for our annual outing, this  was to Bilbao. Cannot fault the  crew or flight . However, the  lack of free  off board food  for short haul  is stupid. There 's now no  incentive to use BA for short  flights when there is a low  fare alternative. This  budget cutting may well back fire.  Possibly initiated by the same imbeciles  who caused the  current outsourcing problems ."
4.0,On to London. I was always of the belief  that British Airways provided a better  quality of economy class travel but  I realise now  why they are  much better than  many airlines. In fact I have  experienced far better service on EasyJet.  Having waited over 2 hours to  get offered a  seat and I  ordered Marks &  Gordon heated focaccia  I had clearly  been in the oven for 2 ! On top  all that there  was just 2  seats for 120  people while business  level customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them.  Off course we  then had to  walk behind the serving trolley to get to the  bathroom so you  cannot imagine how  much that took! They make it  very clear that  business class is  just that but  for shame the price doesn't match  that standard of service. All in all a very  good experience and  you will certainly  think twice about choosing BA in  2019
6.0,"Welcome to Gatwick.  Got the ticket on the last minute due to  the train and  bus schedule. This  is my first  year flying with  Delta and probably  my last if  you have other . It didn't feel like a  big carrier, felt  almost like budget  airline with no  fees and fare  plan that doesn't  cover checked baggage.  Service was smooth , efficient but  about 15mins late  for Edinburgh. No  food whatsoever served  for the flight  unless you pay  an additional fee."
1.0,"Rome to London. Thursday May 18 flight scheduled to  leave at 1200 delayed due to technical issues for 6 hrs and then cancelled at 1730. This caused missed connecting flight to Los Angeles. Very poor communication  to passengers by desk attendants. No one took charge of our situation,  only filtered through  Spanish speaking passengers who sought help with staff from  other airlines. BA  representative was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled  into hotel and told a rep  would give us  further information at . No one from BA was  found or heard from at hotel.  Multiple calls by  passengers to BA resulted in little to no assistance.  Thursday May 19 passengers are shuttled  out to airport , chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at BA counter. After 1 hour in line I  get a boarding  ticket on a flight to London with connection to Los Angeles, however  a BA desk  staff informs me that the flight out of Rome is late due  the technical issues  so I will once again miss  my flight out to LA. I'm appalled at the lack of educated, experienced BA assistance! BA abandoned us at Rome airport. In addition there  web site is of no help. Flight information was  lost and impossible to this day to reach customer  service"
8.0,"Mal Lumpur to  Dubai Very different  to the flight .. It's all  about the crew and how they  behave or how  seriously they take their job. One  man was rude  and when asked  could I have  a glass of  wine told me  no it would take a long  while and he disapeared down the  flight to chat to his fellow  staff  The  staff was slapped  down and we were not offered  any drink. All  were crew and  due to it  was an night  and the crew  spent the time  at the back and ignored when called. It's a shame when you 're BA trying  to turn around  and survive and  now you have  a rude staff  with little to  little service to  their customers or  their airline.

9.0,"The flight from  Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on the Boeing 787-9. The crew were amazing , friendly and  should have done  well The food  served was of good standard and  passengers were asked  a few times if we would like more drinks.  The crew member  which said she  had been with  Boeing for many years was professional , excellent at her job."
1.0,"London Heathrow to  Amsterdam I was looking forward to  the flight - it was Saturday so no work the following day and 62K on the upper deck  had to be  quite a treat!  Having have read many reviews recently  of BA falling behind the competition  so my expectations  are low - but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience. Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight  were super in every way. Nothing  is too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely  like enjoying their  flights I should  have given my ' Golden Ticket' to one of them but forgot. However no matter  how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being  absolutely awful and shabby. The seat  was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the  first flight and crumbs everywhere. Not a nice start. The aircraft was  very very old  and a lot of the interior  is patched up  in white gum. The IFE didn't work properly. Amenity kit was a bag and the  food poor quality. The toilets (compared  to AA) were small unpleasant. Seat is not up to most Business  Jet standard. Food  smells awful and  their 'club kitchen' almost non-existent. These  times I would  choose AA (or Delta, United, Virgin)  any day over BA. It was a shame the  cabin manager seemed  to spend his time going round  each cabin apologising and giving some avios to try  and make people  feel annoyed by  this whole experience."
6.0,"from Domodedovo to  London via London  flew roundtrip in  business class.   Both the flights  was full in  line with the  arrival of BA195  it was 2/3  to 3/4 full.  Qatar Airways flight  staff are cordial  and professional. There  is a wide  range of beverages  available including complementary  alcoholic beverages. The  various in-flight meals  were not bad,  but not great . The 10-hour  trip between London  to Houston featured  buffet dinner early  in the flight  then a snack  towards the end  of the flight.  My 4-hour flight  between London and  Boston featured a  meal at the  end of the  flight I was  greeted by the  sitting room in . I am  quite tall, but  am 180 cm . (71 inches),  I was able  and extend my  legs fully under  a seat in  front of me.  It made these  two flights bearable.  All flights offerred  complimentary blankets, and  towels The cabin  temperatures on the  London to Houston  was cold -  we had to  throw on a  heavy jacket. The  air temperature on  my flight from London to Moscow  felt too warm . I was . When people  are using the  cabin safety card  and fan themselves,  I know it  is warm. The  home entertainment screen  of the B777  for economy is  very poor quality  and needs to  been upgraded. I  can feel the  sound being emitted  off the screen  very well. Make  note that your  bag is below  your weight limit  Very heavy bags  cost an additional  50 USD per  person"
4.0,London Heathrow to Brussels. Disappointed by  a non existent service onboard this . Regardless of  how short the  flight may well  be you expect  any sort of refreshments/snacks to be  served given this  was a low  fare airline. However BA have hit  a bottom in  that they charge  decent rates but  are low carrier  fare - certainly on short haul flights.
1.0,"London Heathrow to  las Vegas. Paid  money for extra  row 51C, as  pictures show the  same type of  seat on 'my ', and there 's no difference to any other seat you would get for free.  No refund given  as it states  this may be  different aircraft used.  Problem is this  airport has always  used the same type of aircraft so it's basically  the con."
8.0,"London Heathrow to San Francisco return  Was pleasantly surprised with the service.  Both flights were  in time and  far ahead of schedule. Online check-in  and baggage drop straightforward and without  incident Food was  good - particularly  for outbound flight.  Our partner is  Hindu and we  had opted for  the Hindu meal  that proved to be delicious. Aircraft in good order and clean. Cabin crew - particularly  one way out , were professional, attentive and friendly. Inflight entertainment choice was generally good,  and something for  all The only  complaint is that  this function is too expensive - even for economy  - British Airways  was being very greedy in this respect, and their  fares are way  cheaper than other  airports This was generally a positive experience."
1.0,"London to Reykjavik.  You can't really  evaluate this flight . British Airways  decided to cancel  my return flight , then my  parents and suggested  we reduce a  5 day family  flight to 2 ! Ruined Xmas. I can review  their total lack  in customer service,  complete contempt for  passengers - all in all, BA are not just  the worst airline, but the worst  company I have  flown with. My  score has to  rank the lowest given the total service failures of  BA"
9.0,"For this route  to Amsterdam to  Tokyo Haneda via  London Heathrow we  got the expected service onboard. The  original flight was  heavily delayed, but  no transfer time  was more then  two hours, so  that didn't cost  any problem. The  airline crew did  its best to  accommodate every passenger  on the flight  to HND. When  they got our  baggage we discovered  only one of  our suitcases was . At HND  British Airlines is  an agent for  international airways and  what it cost  us to explain . Their service  is great. They  made a report  from BA and  since we are  far from the  airport we should  call BA to  repair the damage.  They did and  within a few  days we got  a really extensive  report and were  notified Despite this  broken suitcase it  was handled great.  So what made  the difference to  us"
3.0,"Antigua to Gatwick. Check in at the new terminal was quick and  simple (better than  expected and although we had a slight delay at  boarding we were soon airside. The new lounge was  extremely comfortable and  although we didn't use it (it was dark when  you were there) they have an  open sky terrace with loungers and  comfortable sofa's etc.  The bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food.  Breakfast was on . On board it was soon evident that the interior of the  aircraft had seen better days with my wife's TV nearly falling off its mounting. Fortunately  we was able to position it  throughout the flight so that it  stayed in place  as it was quite precarious. Push  in and departure  was exactly on time. Within a  short time the  crew started the evening service and this is where  it all seemed quite strange. Unlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew  seem to feel  it was a  need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some  among them were literally running down the aisles. The food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. I can only assume that the object  in their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly  was possible. To be quite honest I felt like we were being looked after by  the nanny and told to go to bed early . I almost expected them to  reply 'I want  everybody to go to sleep now and I don't want to here a sound out any of you until the morning'! Now I know , the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of  the day (or  week they are  working and are  being paid to do so. In my opinion if they just slowed down a little  and had more time for the passengers, it would  improve the flight . Breakfast was OK although I seemed to be the only person trying the bacon  sandwich and after one mouthful I understood why. In a blind tasting  I probably would have guessed I  am eating rubber bands. We arrived  before time and  after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim, our  luggage were waiting for us. Overall very disappointing and based on this flight I would not recommend BA."
2.0,"London Heathrow to Amsterdam Schipol on BA434, landed at 14:30. Luggage did not arrive. Contacted  luggage agent - they could not be less interested. Was given some toiletries but no essentials such as cleanser or moisturiser. As it was a Sunday, all shops at Amsterdam were closed at  night so was not able to buy essentials like make up. Called  the luggage call centre 3 times. The first time the agent put  another note in  the system to say that I needed my luggage urgently because of  my customer meeting the next day. Then received message  via phone that  my luggage would be on a  train arriving at  Amsterdam subject to . Called again to check if  my luggage had left Heathrow. Agent could not tell and rudely told  them to wait.  called again at 21:00 and finally  went through. Agent said she would get someone to  contact me to let me know if it was possible for me  to pick up the luggage at Schipol. No one called. Called the next day. All the agent could tell me was , he had no idea when my luggage would  be delivered. Message to BA management: you can do  better by having  a truly on line tracing system and fulfilment system, by employing people who do care about your customers,  and forget about  reassuring your customers that 90% of people get their luggage back within 72 hours. For business travellers, that  is zero comfort. Take a leaf off Qatar Airways, one of your One World partners, they tell their customers if their  bag follows them during transit. And Qatar Airways ground service staff show that they do care."
10.0,"We was pleasantly  impressed with British  Virgin on both  incoming and inbound  routes from Orlando  and Gatwick after  seeing the reviews. I would go  such far as  the say I  would choose them  for Virgin now  as there was  no dramatic price !! The crew  both ways were  fantastic and really  when I have  a Virgin crew  might be a bit up themselves , they are  clear cut above the rest. Contrary  though how Virgin  staff are on  an overnight flight (serve food, dim  light and keep  on the way  an hour before  the BA crew  also regularly came  in making sure  everyone was ok  or if anyone  needed anything. We  experienced nearly 3  hours delay leaving  gate on G-VIIU,  partly due to  it being a  little late due  a an alligator  on the runway  then finally a  power issue on  arrival whilst positioned  off runway to . We returned  at gate for  final top up of fuel etc and departed at 20.20 versus 17.35.  Overall the crew  are fantastic bringing  food round and  feeding us all ! Whilst the  size of the  new fleet of  seats is a  bit on the  cramped side it  is still comfortable  so can recommend  it as there  is no PAX seat behind just  the crew seat  with no issues  about being kneed  in the back.  Our economy class  waiting room was  great Food was  also decent for  comfort food. Only  real negative was the dated AVOD as it has  no screens and  has a great  amount of choice  relative to more modern systems."
1.0,"Welcome to Hong i The Avios  network is now  the complete joke.  Tickets are impossible  for spend. They  have a minuscule  selection of flights , won't allow  passengers to upgrade  on them even when there is  one - they've  even quoted me  over £2,000 to  get a flight  one evening so  you know there's  more - but  still won't let me use Avios.  Their concept of  this service is  ridiculous and smacks  of an ex iling carrier. More  traditional airlines with  incentives to use  their miles booking  systems like Emirates  ought to be successful over this  small of an  issue"

6.0,Mexico City to Copenhagen via London.  Also appears inflight  service has improved a bit in  Denmark and the food is now edible and available. In flight entertainment  was one of  the VHS days. Number of films  available is rather limited. Timing with  food was great. Served quickly after take off and  very late before  flights Made time  is a good  time Configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seats. Some crew choose to open the curtain  to time the  flight while other  are in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private  flight Best thing  about ba is that its cheap and you can have the Dorset crab for lunch  at Fornum and Mason in terminal . Ba refuses to credit Qatar Airways avios even when Qatar Airways in writing has confirmed they should be credited. Showing one level on my online profile  twice now and anotheron my ticket. I have given up on avios.
6.0,"London to Santiago de Chile. Surprisingly pleasing flight onboard Boeing 787, decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window , and discovered the B787 is - or looks - far lighter and wider than any B777 I've been travelling on (could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which  made the ""cocoon"" look less cramped).  Also the seat looks wider, while  the IFE screen  is wider with  slightly higher resolution. The odd ""ying-yang""  view is slightly better on Boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats, therefore  they won't share  quite a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there. So first impression better than usual; unfortunately the soft product remains way below par (I pre-ordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available, but the beef was overcooked and chewy), I will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit  was simply ridiculous  - sort of a blue shoe  size too small to fit shoes . The crew very friendly but  far less attentive than usual. Overall  my experience was  better than usual - mainly thanks to a newer, quieter aircraft -  although BA is not improving where they should, in  the details that make business class  not worth EUR3,000 spent. Still no wi-fi on BA. Not commenting the  seat layout, which remains a mystery  for me (who  does such a nonsense?)."
3.0,"Gatwick to Amsterdam. As a regular flyer with BA,  our experience is that they have some of the best pilots and their inflight staff make all the efforts to give the airline an image. Beyond that,  we have some of the worst airport desk staff in the industry.  We have no solution for the slightest problem! We were scheduled to fly to Amsterdam on the 1st of Feb at 07.45, there was a radar problem in Amsterdam. Easyjet etc were informing their customers of development, nobody informed anyone at the  ticket desk until it became a confusion at almost 09.30! We were rescheduled to the 11.40 flight with another further 2 hours delay. Before  this I have been advised to book a ticket to guarantee a seat on the 11.40 flight. I now had two sets of ticket for same flight. Up to now,  receiving a refund is a nightmare!"
3.0,"How far BA has sunk! Flew London Heathrow to  Dublin and back  this week -  rude and unfriendly cabin crew, food and drinks for purchase. Does BA  compete for Budget Airline now? I  NEVER thought I'd see the day when I would  realise BA has  dropped to (and  exceeds the levels !) Ryanair service,  albeit still around 7x more expensive!"
3.0,"It was very  disappointed because on my flight from  Paris to London (a 4 hour ), no food  or drinks were offered for free.  Not even had to pay for water! This was  such a low  impact flight and  everyone (except business  passengers had to buy any food  or drinks. Very  really disappointed, as  most European airlines  offer free food  and drink/snacks, even from countries such as Greece (Aegean Airlines). Will not choose BA again."
1.0,"I flew London Heathrow to Cape Town, to board  The Queen Elizabeth, Cunard had included  a flight via the Middle East,  which at the time did not  made sense, so  we paid the additional £120 each to fly direct with BA, the  airline I knew  & trusted for  30 years. The  connection was smooth which encouraged me , I had  taken the right choice. However on-board the ageing Boeing  737 nothing else was worth talking about, the food and the service are clearly working to a lower  level than I 've previously had with BA. The  seat available was  good for me;  an average sized man - I don't know how a larger and or taller person  will manage. BA  have lost two loyal customers, but at least they will squeeze more  money from those people who remain.  On my next long-haul I will  likely opt for an alternative airline."
9.0,My wife and I flew British  Columbia from London  Heath to Berlin  arriving in Club . This was  our free Avios ! Having the middle seat blocked  from a meal is the only  significant difference to . We paid  extra seat selection  that I would not have been  allowed to do if I had paid the silly prices charged for  these short flights.  Added value if  not free upgrade.
1.0,"British Airways from Rio de Janeiro to London Heathrow. I booked premium economy to get more legroom as I am 6ft8, however this is non-existent. The crew were rude and when the lady in front of me decided to recline the seat for her 2-year old, and I asked the crew to ""help"" with the situation, they told me that it's the passenger's right to do whatever they want. So no common sense there. Despite having other seats available in the business area, they refused to move me, even though they were seeing the issue (I couldn't fit in my seat for a 10 hour flight). They even told us off as they were getting aggravated by  me being nosy! I had to pay extra 100 pounds each way to reserve 2 seats! Needless to  add the food is awful and  customer service overall is 0/5 stars. This is not  The BA that people once knew. It's under IAG and new ""leadership"" team that aim to cut expenses  without any cost, one of them being customer service.  I like the plague!"
1.0,"From Heathrow to  BA Awful, awful ! My 'randomly'  booked seats were  two seats in  the back two rows on both  flights seems like  peanuts for not  taking their charge  on select seats.  Whilst not too  happy about the  quality of drinks  or meal service  you can see  how the system  BA have created  such a shambles  with no cash  back option, not  in stock etc ... On arrival  back at Heathrow  airport we were  sat on a  bus stand by  desk and then  made to wait  one hour for  a bus to  another terminal. The staff could not  have cared less , spent the  time chatting about  so low BA  has sunk, how  the morale was  down and how they could escape!  Grab your cash and go with a genuine budget airline would be  good advice."
1.0,"Although they indicate  nothing against their policies, they apparently waited for a  delay to get  on the flight  at New York JFK to London  Airport causing a  20 min delay. As a result, we missed our  connecting flight. For  both the other  flights that were  delayed they had arranged for alternatives  and announced them before the flight . However, they did not announce  the arrangement for out flight, even though we specifically asked the flight  attendants to check.  This is the  third time in  2 years I  have poor experience  from British Airways. Their service is  simply unacceptable."
7.0,"On to Antigua.  This was our  last time in  quite a while  flying from the South Terminal and  the first impression  was that the  flight check in  line was a  tad cramped. It  seemed quite busy  for the CW  checking in with  about five couples  the front of  us but as  there were four  slots open, we  were through in  about five minutes.  This fast track  flight was quiet  and we were  sat in the  arrivals lounge. This  was a huge  improvement from its  location in the  South terminal with  good views, comfortable  seats and reasonable  meals (I had  two small bacon  burger and a  slightly strange omelette ). The departure  area was quite  cramped with not  much seating for  any of the  couples but as  the flight was  departure time, it  did really matter.  I had made  the decision some  weeks ago not  too pay an additional cost to  get our seats  closer to the  two hour check  out as this  could have cost  upwards to £340  for my wife  & I, depending  if you wanted  to sit. However,  they were pleasantly  pleased with the  seat we were  given as we  would probably have  used these anyway.  Before boarding we  was offered a  bottle of sparkling  wine which for  my change was  nicely chilled. The  passengers were generally  friendly especially a  German guy who  claimed it was  his first long  haul trip. Once  seated we were  served two drinks  with nuts before  eating and then  more drinks with  water We had  not ordered our  meals so we knew what we  are getting although  their quality was  not OK (I  ordered a chicken  sandwich which was  quite bland). The  condition of the  hotel was rather  revealing its age  and stains on  some carpet with  the overall drab  condition Also, the  light seems to  continue getting worse  so unusually my  daughter found it  impossible to watch  any film due  to the poor  quality Afternoon tea  is OK although  no provision was  made for my  vegetarian sandwiches (she 's a vegetarian)  so we had  to mix and  matched between the  two of us.  Finally landed on  arrival in Antigua.  Overall the flight  proved enjoyable without  really achieving any  new heights (pardon  the pun!) and  together with a  friendly cabin crew , were able  and enjoy the  journey"
7.0,"CT Tegel to London Heathrow in Club Europe business . A weekend evening flight that  felt quite empty.  I had selected  the very cheap  flight to upgrade  into business class and for once  it was worth  going extra. Had checked in online so no contact with ground staff,  and having arrived  via berlin from Beijing with a tight connection I did not bother  to use the  airport lounge here. Knowing the lounge  after previous visits,  the staff are  offering a fair  variety of snacks and drinks, but  they can become  overwhelming and you have to walk  through the lounge  and find toilets.  Service was quick,  only 5 out  of 16 seats occupied in club  class Seats having  no seat pitch and are economy , with middle seat empty. Captain  very informative, and  staff are BA's  greatest asset for  detailed details provided to customers. A  grilled chicken sandwich, cheese & biscuits  and chocolate mousse was served - all to a  good standard. Drinks  are your choice  from the bar  and decent coffee to follow. Cabin  flights were extremely  fast and efficient, probably due to  being a quiet  Friday evening flight."
7.0,"Those are words  you may not read often, but I actually enjoy the British Airways  flight from London ! The staff  are friendly and,  right now, they 'll feed you  and offer extra drinks. After flying  internationally for several decades, I have decided to cut  my losses on  the miles and  extra points for long haul because  of the cost-cutting. But for short-haul,  this is my first choice out  from City."
10.0,"London Manchester, UK  and Billund, Denmark.  I flown with  Scandinavian Airways for  over 10 years  and work throughout  continental Europe. Compared to other airlines I've used they by far in  our view, deliver  best service all  round Staff are  helpful and friendly. Food is always tasty. Easy check  in system at the airport. Efficient , very good value for money all round."
1.0,"Back to Bangkok  today for work.  An old plane with vintage entertainment ! Drinks were  served before dinner,  two nuts/crisps available followed by a  dessert but small ! As it 's around 20.30  local time, I  made the call  desk to ask  for an after  meal drink for  two colleagues and myself. After a  10 minute wait  the surly disapproving stewardess arrived and  gave us a dressing down essentially  whilst still being  rude and requiring . Incorrect drinks  were then brought.  One colleague asked  the steward who  was across the  room chatting to  who appeared to  his friends to correct the mistake  and was told to wait. Eventually  my correct drink  is brought. I've  written a letter  and complaint but  so yet no  reply from British  Airways I've flown  with a great  few and generally  have a reasonable experience so it's  interesting to see  this general direction  the airline seem  to be going.  A company I 'm working for  paid for the ticket so I  dont know what  it cost but  can imagine it 's cheap. In their defence, I  came back with  friends from Delhi  in a dreamliner  1 week later and the experience  is fine so  perhaps the age  of the plane  may not excuse  the staff."
2.0,"I am one of those crazy  women who still  (& recently) flew  daily - London Heathrow weekly paying nearly £400 with  British Airways as  always the key airport. Now the last flight always  goes to a  bus stand and  my morning flight (boarding 6.15 for 6.50 flight) is  just a bus to a plane , is never  empty and always departs late. Holidays  to Madeira ended with me and mum sitting on  a floor in a departure hall for 5.5hrs. I  switched to BA and got the  door fob off.  Add insult to injury and no  communication at all on the plane!  So game over  for me and  every trace of a relationship. It's now tedious &  we have to  go in all  my effort to loyalty with absolutely no return affection!"
8.0,"Full trip for  me and my  wife using Avios  flight from London  Airport to Miami.  They were very  polite and professional  for both sectors. Flights on time. Food and drink  service were decent,  but not on a par with  the other carriers.  Pretty clear BA's  cost cutting affects  our cabins. On  the outbound leg  the choice of  golf course was  easy as they  have already been  given to other passengers. Having said that, I could  have ordered in  advance via the web site. On  our return leg,  it worth noting  the access to/from  a lounge is  just a single  step and very  energy consuming. So  this was a  lovely touch that  one of the  lounge staff escorted me and my  wife (we are  both gold card holders) from the  gate and put  us on the  plane first as  the boarding gate  became chaotic due  at it being  bank holiday weekend.  A very enjoyable  experience but not  any better than  the airlines' business !"
7.0,"BA12 onboard British Airways A380 for the gruelling 13 hours from Singapore to London Heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passengers. I'd like to be biased to BA - I'm silver member and  Canadian and it's my national carrier but come on let's get to the chase. This route is now also served by Garuda and Singapore and I can say BA are  near the bottom of the list for the economy service. Seats are really uncomfortable and near impossible to find an angle to get some rest, the pillows are wafer thin - like sitting on a a  pile of tissues bundled together. Food is lousy and they have removed the silverware and dinner extras like crackers, chocolates and other things that you can snack on. They close down the rear galleyway and turn it into their personal hang out area instead of a self service drink and snack zone like other airlines. This also means you are stuck in your aisle which is frustrating when you want to get to an unoccupied toilet in the other aisle and your toilet section has queues. Further toilets are not regularly cleaned and soap ran out half way through the flight and wasn't refilled. BA have downgraded their economy service in all areas and you feel like the crew treat you like a poor peasant - polite and respectful but minimum effort. On the plus movie selection is great and TV on the A380 is good but not in Singapore Airlines league. Your air miles earning for this route is more generous than Garuda and  so I Would recommend premium economy if you can or If you have to make this route try and get upper deck where configuration is 2-4-2 rather than 3-4-3 downstairs. Or alternatively try the competition which  will soon include Norwegian Air and I can't see how Norwegians' economy class can be any worse than BA's."
2.0,"Flew Nice to London with British Airways in economy.  Never bother again. Moving most of my travel to KLM/LH now where  i can at least get a complimentary G&T. BA nice flight had  good legroom, only 1 lavatory at  way back (with aisle blocked however  so crew selling buy on board). So low cost. So over them."
1.0,"London to Male. I booked a  flight for my wife to India but before paying  for it I called the BA executive club to make sure that  my fare was  not refundable. They  informed me that it was less  an administration charge. I then had to cancel the booking and instead I booked a  flight with BA  in the Maldives.To  My dismay I  were not refunded  what I expected for the fare  from India. Instead they only refunded the taxes/insurance etc. After the cancelled  tickets I called BA at the  start of March to find out  what had happened,  They told me that they would get back to me within 30 %. Two months  ago I called them again and was told that  they refund department  should call me.  Finally they did this morning and  tell me that  my ticket was  not refundable and they would not  call me back. Either the executive club of BA are lying or  BA are incompetent. I was asked  a time and date when I called BA but  as I do  indeed have it  so I did not think it necessary to log  the call. It is obvious to me that BA do not honour their commitments and  I will no  longer fly with  BA I have  served an executive  club for 40 years and this  shows how BA treat their customers. An absolute disgrace."
2.0,"I abandon you  without a return  to Rude and  poor customer service ! Both BA flights in the  US and the  direct flights to  Rome were delayed  by up to  3 hours. No clear sign on boarding gate screen  for delayed flights , big mess up of mixing the delayed flights  onto the screen.  Imagine in being  stuck in Rome airport with BA  customer service not  offering to take any responsibility for their mess up  with no compensation  or even refund, let alone minimum  effort trying to help a client.
"
1.0,"Return to London . This time I was among  the first few  passengers aboard the aircraft. I was  travelling with two  bags so I  had to find  the space for 3 trolley cases.  We discovered a  bag was already  in the overhead compartment above my  seat and it  belongs to a  flight crew. . It was a  short flight so how could the  cabin crews put  the bags in  a compartment before  me and let  me struggle to  make a space  and delay the  whole process? BA 's short haul  was simply a  commercial airline, and  better than their competitors in the  cabin baggage management.  i wasn't impressed by their on  call service either.  they were so greedy to earn  profits from selling  seats to a  group of noisy  passengers even though  there were complaint  from other passengers."
2.0,"Glasgow to Chicago  from Heathrow and  had the offer  to upgrade to  economy economy at  no extra cost. What a disappointment,  this aircraft was an old 747-400  badly in need  of a refit. Cabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats , video system  were ancient and  had to be  changed for it  to work. This  was until 40 minutes into flight  BA kept jumping  the flight. Staff  was nice but  a noticeable difference  to economy. In fact the economy section on the  old 747 on the return flight  to 296 was better than the premium offer on  that leg. To be honest BA had a cheek ily charge for  their supposed 'premium .' This was  hardly an upgrade especially compared to the equivalent product on Virgin. To  put matters worse the BA customer  services reply to our issues raised  was just not good enough just  a standard corporate apology effort. With no regards for keeping future business. To be honest a poor service  go round from  a national carrier"
1.0,"i have always  wanted fair reviews  for any airline.  At BA and  being a Gold (Emerald) member I 've lost my patience. I have  tried now for  1 week to  check flights online and via their  call centre to book and upgrade.  As the site  says availability it  all croaks to  one halt with  no error, it  had been 7 days of this. I have contacted  them through their  twitter account to  be told to  use their Bahrain  customer centre, which of course does  the work but  I been told  to call the Indian centre. 4 times I have  tried at my  own expense to  call people with  no English, have  NO idea how  they manage the upgrade, quote outrageous  prices 4 times  their web price.  social media twitter  just go through the motions rather  than having some  people take control.  It has got  past the point  with so many  negative reviews I  will use the  internet and move  to Qatar who  have their loyal customers.  My  on the ground as well at  their air service , now budget.

3.0,"Flying Heathrow to Edinburgh. Almost hilarious had I not  already been handed  the debit card , when the plane was advised  the put their  dining tables back  on the upright  row I was  in row 12  in first 7  of business class.  I was the  last to be  served food or  no drink. I  bought the sandwich  or wine when  we got home.  Probably would have  be easier to buy the sandwich  of choice at  home at Edinburgh ! The budget  carrier could show  US Airways how  to do a proper operation. The  next 10 or  15 rows go  through apology and  not to eat  or drink. BA  do not even  have the acronym  of budget airline.  Absolutely useless."
1.0,"From London Heathrow  to Vienna. Wow, who is running  this company? In  over 30 years  flying flying I've  never seen an airline deteriorate so  much as British  Air has recently.  I can accept that I now have to pay  twice if I  forget to check  out a bag,  and to sit  in a 'full-service'  lounge for over 2 hours without  anything much as  a complimentary cup  or water, really?  Do I miss something, have they  changed their prices?  Did they just  expecting suckers like me to pay more for something  that was (and  probably is at  all prices) included  in the fare.  It now offers  some food and drinks for purchase but the service  was so slow and by the  time we'd almost reached our destination there was a  mess of an  argument with a  woman who'd ordered  his hot sandwich,  but because the  ordering machine wasn't  ready they took  her food back  to the galley  then left the  customer without. The atmosphere was pretty  and it's been  quite few years  now I've experienced  such a miserable  airline flight. That  was probably Ryanair but they've really  lowered their game.  UK Airways was  a great carrier,  just a year  of so back, but now it's really overpriced rubbish,  and they don't  let me feel  comfortable anymore. There  were so many other options in Europe. "
7.0,"Flight sat in 35J/ 35k which  was a two seat row. The  plane is 3x4x3 otherwise. See seat . Aircraft full  of boarding and  security was well handled by the ground staff. The  flight left 10 mins early, arrived 15 mins ahead of schedule. Within one hour of  boarding we were  on the gate for our connecting  flights to Aberdeen.  Flight was OK , things are not as they  should with British  Airlines Food bland , unexciting, drinks service limited. Breakfast  being served way  very late in the flight. No  customer complaints, toilets  flush and functional.  TV entertainment worked  fine but the volume/ bud type  controls were poor  which distorted the  sound which was  difficult to follow.  Security was OK.  The crew were polite and did their job. Arrival  from Terminal 5  A gates and  transfer to A gates was a breeze at 0600 , walked straight  back to Boarder  with no one  is in the  area Even security  were very quiet.

"
1.0,"Air Terminal 3 to Budapest in  January 2017. Busy  week before the bank holiday weekend resulting in most wheelie bags being  dropped off passengers.  Flying in row 12F which was the 6th row of economy class.  After taking off on-time, it took 70 mins for the food trolley to travel 6 rows. Service was  in absolute shambles! 2 staff serving a full flight  while 2 other staff serve approximately 12 people in  Economy class. Instead of the standard routine of the person each side of the trolley serving different rows, one steward just  stood there whilst the stewardess struggled  not use the  ticket payment machine.  instead of prioritising passengers yet to be served, the  woman kept serving  those she had already served (because they had finished their drinks in  the time it took her to  move 4 rows).  A senior purser then appeared and told off the clearly flustered staff that they had  half of the plane to serve with only 45 mins of flight time left! British Airways have really let themselves go downhill - will not be going  outside of my way to fly with them again unless they're the cheapest option."
8.0,"Zürich to London Heathrow. As part of a 12-days-trip almost around the world my first leg from Zürich  to London was on British Airways. It turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Thanks to early online-check-in I managed to secure a bulkhead aisle-seat. I would have preferred a window-seat though. Boarding started on time  and there was a very friendly purser welcoming the passengers. After I settled down I  approached her with my request. She said that the flight was completely full but promised to do her best. After less than five minutes she returned to me and offered me a seat at the window but emphasized that my actual seat had much more legroom. So I stayed. The rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy too. Special requests by other passengers were dealt with professionalism. I brought  my own snack and water along which was a wise thing to do as the catering-service was slow. The new procedure takes too much time and let passengers disappointed as their choice is running out quickly.  Airlines should reinstall the old system again. The cabin was spacious but the aircraft showed  considerable age. The flight took off with a delay of 20 minutes but was a the gate at  Terminal 5 15 minutes before scheduled arrival time.
"
1.0,Dublin to London.  800 Euros for  THE worst business class flight you can imagine. Business  Class with no extra leg room just the middle seat blocked off. Outbound from Dublin around lunchtime. I was hungry and all they had  was some ham  sandwich and nothing else. I was told I had to order a kosher meal if I did not eat ham. So I practically had nothing to eat. The stewardess was kind enough to give me some bread and a snack. However I was looking forward to a decent  dinner after forking out for a  first class flight. So I ordered a kosher meal  before my return flight. I got the kosher meal but it was vile. Some sort of salmon that  looked tasteless. Very poor experience. BA should not call  this business class as it was worse than a low cost carrier.
8.0,Flew British Airways  from London Gatwick to Orlando. Contrary  from a lot  of the other  airlines I found the aircraft and  people on board to be fine.  As in 24  inches on G-VIIO seat was comfortable and big enough with a decent amount of recline.  Still agree the  flight is not  to the standard  of other airlines  but it was  comfortable and had a fairly decent  amount of content  to it. The staff were all  very attentive and  helpful so no  surprises there. Inflight meals were the  standard chicken or vegetarian option plus  another sandwich was offered shortly before  boarding
1.0,"UK Airways from  Scotland to London : The service was what you 'd expect from  the budget carrier like EasyJet or  Emirates The only  difference that the  service was 150%  too expensive. EasyJet  had a service  from Aberdeen to  London Gatwick for  a £50 return.  Our flight cost  mine and my  husband £160 each.  They were no  onboard snacks offered,  so had to  add £60 each  On top of  that for our  luggage to be  returned to the  hotel The only  time we flew  British Airways was  when we had a connecting flight  to Heathrow with  that airline. British  people use the  airlines for the  air fair and  without frills because  they the ""fees""  they have to  make at Heathrow.  We don't buy  it though. Our  return flight from  Glasgow cost £420 , and was  only 14 hour . Yet a  4 hour and 30 minute flight  with BA costs  400 each. How  would that work?"
2.0,"from Heathrow to  London British Airways  had been the  carrier our organisation  has chosen for  their staff for  use when they fly the routes  and to our  chosen destinations. Recently as the Director  I have been getting complaints about service, cleanliness and  management from several  members of my  colleagues which I  had listened to  and have been  too busy and  I hadn't listened  to exactly what  management seems to  do based on  our personal experience. This recent trip to Toronto summed  it up for  you Firstly, after  costing around £1000 s each for  two Premium Economy  ticket for each  of the three  if us travelling,  like competitors BA does not provide priority boarding, you  end up with  only the other  two passengers?. When  you board you are met with  poor staff, some  poorly dressed, others  they look as if they have  suffered a bad  day so who manages quality and standards?. Premium economy  offers a little more space than  Economy however that  is about it.  Comfort levels in  your cabin are minimum, food is  minimal and to  my honest is  in disgrace compared  for the price, and towards the end of the  flight you are offered a second  drink and 'a  coffee delivered with  almost the fanfare  and a 'gold  star being delivered,  but the discontent and upset on  the flight by  people in Premium  economy was both  visible and vocal,  BA staff could  not have cared ? Other companies such as Air  Berlin offer a superior experience for  the same price.  Business management need  to get their  acts together otherwise  their customers such  as my organisation  were just on the edge of  ignoring them completely.  It definitely breeds  resentment but BA  management is taking  their biscuit with this and some  on its other  complaints The marketing  campaign does not  match the reality.  On Ground service , management at  Delta is appalling,  people sitting around, passengers bags missing,  and no one  to help? staff  is openly rude  or dismissive. A  full review is  required"
9.0,"London to Boston.  Nice flight without  a problem, arriving  good time despite  a little late departure. Seat confort  seemed great for  kids Back of  seats was very good and leg room seemed above average... seat confort on this A380  seemed better than  previous A380. Crew  seemed great, available  meals with special  offer to kids. "
6.0,"Newark to London Heathrow. You have to be very careful when choosing a flight to New York. Most of the JFK flights are 20+ years old Boeing 747-400s - prone to breaking down on the tarmac. The 747 ""New 1st"" is so cramped and I avoid any 747 flight whenever possible. I deliberately choose Newark as it is served by a new Boeing 787. Coming back we were on one - with just 8 seats in 1st Class. Its not bad, a bit better than the Boeing 777 - but nowhere close to Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. The lounge is a shared one with Cathay Pacific. Its ok, but apart from a ""1st"" dining area, 1st class passengers are bundled in with Club passengers. It is a nice set up though. Boarded on time and had dinner. Tasteless starter of prawns and fennel. Horrible soup. Chicken mains  was ok. Wines ok. The bed was made up and I slept for a few hours. We were not stacked for  takeoff and landed ahead of schedule. Plane seemed pretty empty and Club was very empty. Club is a lousy set up  and the seat is appalling. As we walked through the cabin I was reminded how  ugly and daft the ying yang seats are."
6.0,"London Heathrow to Newark. We had heard a lot about the BA First Class ""wing"" at LHR and  after checking in we made our way through it - directly from the check in area. The security  check screening area is prompt and you find yourself in the First of the BA 1st Class lounges. If you did not know about the more exclusive ""Concorde"" lounge you would probably plonk yourself down here - as the check in staff did not mention the better lounge. The first one was rammed - end to end and we negotiated our way around the bags and carry on luggage strewn all over the place. The Concorde lounge was half empty and  we had breakfast in the dining area. It was okay. The lounge  looked long, long overdue for a refurbishment. The Boeing  747 was parked at the B terminal and we were shown to our seats by a friendly FA. Champagne was served and for once  it was chilled. The cabin looked a little tired and I suspect the plane was one of the first to have New First. We had the new  Boeing branded wash bags which was light years ahead of the tacky bags we had last December. No  amuse bouche - and no flowers in the WCs. There were nine passengers in First - and with  an average spend £3,000 - one way, the total revenue would have been circa £36,000. Well done BA, you saved £10 for two bunch  of flowers in the loos and 9 x £5  in the amuse bouche - grand saving of the operating costs a massive £55. Lunch was chosen from the cheap tacky menus (Pizza Express is better quality) - and my eyes popped as I read the lead appetizer, and  I quote: ""Loch Fyne Kinglas smoked  fish with Oscietra caviar, Burford egg, shallots, creme fraiche , chive cress.""  oh my goodness - Caviar. My excitement was short lived. I had caviar alright - but just five eggs. (Yes folks 5 eggs, not 5 grams) You  have to laugh.  My soup was . The salad never arrived. The main cod fillet and cod cheeks was very good in indeed. Wine ok. FAs all fine. We landed  ahead of schedule  time and whoever  landed the plane was a zen  looking pilot. I did not feel the plane touch the tarmac. "
7.0,"Back to London Gatwick. Started return  trip in the  airport lounge. All very pleasant and  very busy for once. Walked the  way to the plane as BA are too mean to pay for a skybridge anymore. Plane fairly new , a lot better than the old crate we flew out in.  Set off on . We had the front row of the business class. For once I had the  salad - as it looked nice. It was a  fruit salad - and I have to say it  is very good indeed. My wife had a hot  dog sandwich which  we said was  like Champagne was served from the bottle, it was ! We landed on time and closer to the terminal. Not bad for BA for  once"
10.0,"Heathrow to San Francisco. Upper deck in Economy, great service, friendly and efficient crew.  . Check in was very swift, tend to not  do the self check in and self bag tag, but more and  better airlines are going this way so have to accept it - it was very quick so no  complaints there. "
2.0,"Berlin to London. What an embarrassment!  This national carrier has become a laughing stock. German passengers with us  are amazed that all items of refreshment had to  be purchased. Each transaction took a long while, being paid by card. Two elderly male flight attendants were  only able to service a full flight within the time available. The  seats on offer were limited. British Airways used to epitomise service and quality : it is now just  as any other cheap carrier."
3.0,"From Gatwick to  Birmingham I fly this route often  but this flight  marks my first  use of the South Terminal. Its not as ""user friendly"" as the  original - and meanders around, up  or down -  and over the place. Could also  use with a refurbishment. We approached  a new BA lounge, which is  going to miss not being in the best place  in the Terminal,  without reservations as everything BA does  here is cheap  and skimpy. Pleasant surprise - its pretty top notch. Good food and  plenty of booze. Nice and airy  and spacious seating. We wondered for a moment if  I had wandered  into the wrong lounge. All good  So far. Then the flight was called and our  new found love  affair with BA quickly receded. The  line to the gate was miles, it took us  45 minutes - and needed a  bit of a  change as well. Arrived all nice and sweaty. Plane  was busy and we had the front row (the best seats). Usual  experience with the lousy seats -  seats masquerading as  good seats. Plane  cold and dirty. The WC was  dirty - dark  and dingy and the ""bowl"" - well, I dare not even try and describe it here - save it looked like  some previous person  had not flushed it - leaving a permanent effect.  Hats off on ! My wife had the sandwiches , which she said was dry , tasteless. I  opted for a  shot of Gin and Tonics. You  cannot expect much  less from BA and therefore you are disappointed - before you get  another chance to  feel disappointed. Crew were fine -  but don't like  these BA cost cuts. As one said ""we spend  all the flight  catering to passengers."" They also said charging economy customers for food had gone down like a lead balloon. I did notice during boarding two passengers bringing their own food and  drinks on board. Disgraceful."
2.0,"Flying Heathrow to  Manchester I have  tried flying with  Qatar Airways for  years although I  have used them  because I was  annoyed at the  quality or lack  of service. Our  local carrier has  fallen into the  ground The crew  were nce and  friendly so no  real complaints apart  from on a  3 hour flight  on the day,  crew were nowhere  to be seen  for about 1.5 hours before landing. The food was  just appalling. For  dinner we were  served a choice  on meat and  vegetables I had  a filet which  looked as hard  as leather with  a sort of  thick brown gravy  - totally tasteless.The  salad was served  as potatoe mash  and a pea  salad this was  the only thing  available on the  tray A tiny  green salad. The  odd hard as rock bread roll.  For dessert, a  tiny piece of  chocolate brownie.Complimentary drinks  are out of  stock so most  customers didn't realise  you could ask  about wine etc.  A small container  for water was  under the tray.This  dinner was served  for 2 hours  into the flight  and then nothing  else to eat until roughly before  dinner At which  time was served  a folded slice  of pizza served  in a box,  a packet of  chips and popcorn  (& carbohydrates) and  a small container  of water. I  ordered the pizza  as it was tasteless and just like cardboard.So I  ate it and  had the crisps  and popcorn with  some tea/coffee was  good  I  am not expecting  this gourmet meal,  and there was  no thought given  about the food  selection on British  flights There was  little fruit, no  meat or proper  food There were  NO soft drinks  offered or any  proper serving of  even the basic  food The flight  crew did not  include A couple  good new films,  The rest were  unknown or unheard ! The music/radio  station was the  best with no  good music or unheard of artists. My daughter, booked  an expensive direct  flight for me  to my destination in the US.  We have asked her not to  fly me on  UK Airways again. I would rather  fly on Virgin  and Delta indirect. This by far  is my worst  flight experience on  the long distance  of any airline  but quite honestly  i just couldn't wait to get  off"
9.0,"Back to St  Lucia return. Out bound was World  Airways return Club.  In the evening  I went to  book drop. Reading , we were approached and offered  drinks by a BA staff member.  Checks in cheerfully done. BA airport  service faultless. Seats,  food and entertainment good, drinks plentiful, staff attentive and  helpful Return trip, flight crew greeted us with smiles  and showed us  into our seats.  Good seats with  clear eye masks,  warm blankets etc.  Food service started  straight away and  lasted all flight.  BA Dinner and  drinks terrific. Staff  friendly and friendly  throughout flight. All  in all both  passengers were on  the aircraft with  an attentive crew.  I couldn't fault our flights however  I have sympathy for those who  experienced troubles. Sad that happy passengers  are a few  is a positive ! Thank you  and we shall  consider flying with  you again."
7.0,"London Heathrow to Bangkok. We had  just flown BA10  in Bangkok to  London a month  earlier so were  all hoping that  I got better  accommodation in the crazy business class  queue on this  trip Of course  I had to  charge extra to  reserve the seats  so wanted to  make sure we  sat together so  had J and  I seats. Check  point at LHR  were good, lounge  on T5 was  good (Friday afternoon),  but I was  not happy that  J had to  go bussed to  Bangkok No priority  boarding and when  it arrived the  entire herd boarded  in business class  flight and we couldn't even get  to our seats!  After boarding, toilet  in business class  was out of  hand with a  handwritten note stuck  to the door , wasn't it  posted prior to  the flight?). For  no reason throughout  this flight people  were coming into  business class to  use the toilet  it angered me  that staff did  to stop them.  Long queues for  seats with one  toilet in action  and other cabin  crew using the  private toilet! Not  good enough. Food and wine were  nice and crew  were good. Flat mate was good.  Service was slow.  Two movies as  usual four weeks ."
5.0,"London to London  airport - after  reading the negative  reviews and the  stories about BA  flying late, I 'm not expecting  that at all  on this trip.  Terminal 5 is  another breeze and  proved to be  one of the  best things about  flying with BA,  we checked in  and cleared security  within 20 minutes.  we secured seats  at the upper  tier of the  cabin which seemed  very intimate than  when we were  at the lower  deck Seats were  used for the  entertainment and entertainment , BA cabin crew seemed rushed  for the journey,  cabin purser was  constantly talking when  people were entering  our aircraft, no  smile from her  or acknowledgement. Once  you got to  your seats, there  was no space  left in the  luggage lockers, no  instructions from cabin  management but didn't  get any either,  we just looked  confused and told  passengers where not  they store our  food Food was kept to the  bare minimum for  a 13.5 hour  journey with 2  main meals provided  at dinner and  with nothing in  between I was  pleasantly surprised to  get the second  course meal for  dinner We got more food and  drink on our  last flight from  London to Australia,  this was much  nicer at 7 . I still  cant understand how  we are considered  a 4 star , Qantas also  scored 4 star  but was much  nicer In all  I was not  happy with BA,  if I prepared  them for the  flight I would  still fly them  back if I  would score cheap !!"
2.0,"London Heathrow to  the Arlanda. BA is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline prices. I'm a  loyalty card holder and have always chosen to fly BA, primarily to maintain it. Not any more. It's not worth bothering  with the galleries  buffet at Heathrow  because the hot food has been replaced (most of the time) with  sandwiches and cakes. The small touches like the takeaway , etc. have gone too. And I'm now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights - even 6 weeks ! It's hard  not raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards - they don't seem  like care anymore. The last time I flew premium economy, the food was inedible. Just  have to book  on another airline  on principle. I  got to say  I hope BA ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them  all when customers leave. If you're going to be a low cost airline, charge low cost prices."
3.0,"Bangkok to London : Boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding  instructions resulting in  a free for all. The flight was packed full.  Our inflight entertainment system didn't work for the entire  flight - this is a 13 hr flight and  so with time spent on the ground waiting for  turn back nearly  3 hours. I  have noticed that  airlines don't seem to care about  computers not working  with BA0009 and BA0010 as it has been quite  common on this  route for some  customers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide  problem effecting all  passengers The captain made a number of announcements apologising  and asking passengers 's patience and explaining that it wasn't the cabin  crew fault, they  were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction. He  explained that the  cabin had overheated  - well that  explains things! I do not eat  commercially served meals on board due  after becoming very  sick on a  long BA0009 flight I never want  that experience again, so I was looking forward to  having the snacks which are usually  available however I was told they had been withdrawn - I was  very happy but  I brought a  few from the  airport so although  not very hungry. I managed but  wonder how well  does air compare  between sandwiches and  rice pot noodles  for meals! The  cabin crew were  great but after serving meals stored  in trolleys between  the two aft toilets next to the rear doors  both sides of  the aircraft effectively  preventing access to all the 4 toilets. Passengers wanting  these toilets had quite a struggle  trying push past them. I have  not seen or  experienced this on  any flight and  wondered if this is actually a safety concern. ie blocking doors? I also experienced sinus problems, pain and congestion which is I believe due  the the air  conditioning on Boeing 777 airplanes, the  air being very dry with little  ventilation I do take precautions but  mine has taken a month to  suffer from the terrible headaches, sinus  pain and congestion. I only experience  these after flying on 777's and there are flight crew forums on  Facebook discussing 777 air quality problems. The captain was  on hand to apologise for disembarking  passengers and was  very annoyed that  the plane was not fully serviceable.  I complained to BA and also  the CEO Alex Cruze having been  told to do so by the crew. My email  from the CEO  was forwarded to  customers services, no surprises there. Customer Services who replied  duly investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints  for food and  a full compliment  had not loaded hence no snacks.  I was advised  however the lack of IFE would be investigated by  a maintenance team. They would not acknowledge any problem <mask> the air quality but I <mask> expect them to. By way <mask> compensation I was given 3000 Avios points which to me is <mask> especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers, they are worth <mask> third of what they were a year ago <mask> can only <mask> used where <mask> are accepted! <mask> I am disappointed in both <mask> flight and <mask> level of compensation, I have <mask> to stay loyal to our <mask> carrier but <mask> have no confidence anything will be done to <mask> the passenger <mask> on this route. The only way to check is to fly <mask> route again with BA, do <mask> risk it <mask> Therefore I <mask> be looking <mask> all options <mask> the future including middle eastern <mask> with a plane change!"
1.0,Istanbul to London. I am sad to say British Airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive one. It hard to see any difference  from my flight experience on a  US airline and British airways except the ticket price.  This disappointment is so high because I had high expectations I paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit ! I haven't flown British Airways for years and I shocked by how much it had gone downhill. It is riding on its once good reptutation and short changing customers! Save you coins  and something else you don't get what you pay for with British airways.
3.0,"Belfast to Seoul via London Heathrow. Pretty poor. Short haul connection to  Bangkok was good, before you had to pay for  snacks and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long  flight Flight from London was very cramped, I'm slightly  above average height but by no means a giant and I really  needed to get comfortable. Seat was too narrow, very  small leg room  and the space to put my feet was taken  away by what I assume was the processor for the IFE system for the seat in front. The  seat was very  uncomfortable and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours. The food was  really nothing special. Not very much of it and the thimble of  hot water you get every few  seconds is hardly . As a  child I remember the food on BA flights being  really good but something has gone  horribly wrong. Staff are one of the few things BA has going for it at the minute, one of the few things left from the BA of old when it was actually worthy of the name.  Great staff on  every flight and in the airport.  Had the same route with Qatar  Airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league. One last note, you  get this terminal 5 which is meant to be ""world class"". Firstly there is no smoking area, although we're constantly being  advised not to smoke many people  still chose to. You expect people to wait in your terminal for  hours on connections  so we can't  just enjoy a fag in the  terminal though it  seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as  are normally met with a wall  to smoke when  we walk in. I am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a Rolex and a Gucci outfit,  unlike most people.  Would recommend you  set up some shops where normal people can actually  do the things  on them rather than just window shop. "
1.0,"Welcome to London Heathrow. I am  an BA Gold Guest list member with 75,000 tier  so I cannot  understand what is  happening to BA. The attendants and  management look embarrased  and be offering  me a poor  service product. Cramped seats, chaotic boarding, every flight announced  your flight is  boarding today so if you want to check bags"".  In other words,  they have crammed  together so many  people there is  not room for  checked luggage. Now you pay for  fuel and even water. Two trolleys  walk very slowly down the aisle  because it takes  too long to serve and pay  for food or  drink effectively blocking  entry to the  terminal for the  next flight. How can they let  this cost-cutting CEO with no understanding  about quality service run a premium  British airline. It is appalling and this is no  better than a  high cost carrier with low cost  airlines - a  reason to be  considered British. This  service is in terminal decline and I need to  ask for matched  flight from a  rival premium airline.  Just pay for  this shortfall, use cheap alternatives, its  all same service."
9.0,"Air Traveler Plus : Heathrow to  Dubai The only  complaints we had  about the experience  were that the  onboard entertainment system  had to be .  Boarding  is pretty much average, with no  special boarding for  it just everybody  got on.   Our time in  Premium Economy, and  we loved it.  The BA shined  brightly post-flight. I  committed the unforgivable  and walked off with the wrong  check bag.  Discovered it 3  hour drive later.  Was contacted by staff at BA , and in  spite of the  incident being entirely  at fault, immediately  agreed to FedEx  ship my bag to me.   Despite having just  returned from a  trip on a  flight famed for its food, the  bags stood up surprisingly well compared  to Oceania's."
5.0," Buenos Aires to  Santiago I was  convinced that BA  had gone downhill,  and I decided  a give it  the try on  this long haul . To start  off you cannot  change your seat  directly to check-in,  and after paying  around 2000€ for a business class  ticket you are  going to spend  an additional 90€  a leg to  find your seat . I call  that insane, to  be honest. So , waited and  waited and waited  till check-in opened,  eventually made it , get a  front facing aisle  in LATAM Lounge . Buenos Aires  was nice, food  ok but connecting from Santiago I  had the time  too take a shower, with ground  attendants extremely nice  and attentive. Boarding  was sort of  chaotic mess, as  they let frequent  customers (not flying !) board through  to Business class  window so there  is a flood  in people moving  back and forth  trying get to  the rear of  your plane; crew simply unable to  handle this process,  so you did  really feel like being taken care  off during boarding.  This was a  small Boeing 777-300  that looked a  bit ""tired"". Seat was the absolute  toughest part of  my flight, as  BA is narrow,  so hard to  find a nice  table and for  some passengers this  also feels like having a ""wall""  on one side  and being exposed  to people/trolleys passing  down the aisle  from the other , once flat  ( is a  bit short too  long for me,  almost 180cm high,  no giant here)  is narrow so  often find yourself  forced to sleep  at a side;  and addition to  this when you lie down the  seat is not  adjustable therefore you  have literally no  place to store , not even  your glasses if  they wear them. Food was just  amazing (I still  cannot understand how  you can run  short of entrée  options in Business ), crew very  accommodating for such  an long trip  but friendly and  honest it really  seem they are  recovering from these  price cuts as they keep apologizing  that everything that 's not available  is not working.  Sound system made  me smile a  little as the  quality of movies  was ok but  our screen was  noticeably smaller than  most other carrier  Business class ones.  To sum up,  that was an  excellent flight, if  it was not  for the lie-flat  seats I would  call it more  like Premium Economy  rather than a Business one. BA  need to improve  business class as  they are well  above par if  comparable to almost  all European carriers,  and even to  some the Middle  East airlines. "
5.0,"Gatwick to Pisa. Check in at Gatwick a breeze. Chaotic boarding process though. Flight took off approximately 10 minutes late. The cabin crew were exceptional and are  one thing that  airlines have going for them. Middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no  extra leg room in the seats  so if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room. As for the catering.  BA are getting this wrong. Why are they insisting on dumbing down on their once  high standards. I hardly call 'cheese on toast' a satisfactory meal choice. Despite calling it , Monsieur it is still cheese on toast what ever way you look at it ! I hope  Mr Cruz reads these reviews. It is not what the customer wants. BA are turning into a high cost no frills airline. So much for their motto 'To fly to serve'. Remember Mr Cruz and Mr  Cook there are other airlines offering a much better service."
4.0,"On British Airways , London to Dubai. To start  with awful seats. I felt like  it was being squashed by both passengers on either side of me.  Not more room.  If it was rude staff, I was shocked. To  top it off  after the host came around with the the food , completely skipped  out and was working his way back. When I interrupted him to  look for food  people got annoyed  with me. When I moved my seat back after  he had removed the food trays, a man behind  him hit my chair and started  shouting at me.  As a female  sitting alone and  I felt frightened  after that. Just shows how little  respect everyone has been given. I'm really disappointed with BA."
1.0,"Back to London  with British Airways.  As things have  changed Passengers now  stand at gate  4 with easyJet  and Ryanair, rather  that sitting and  pretending to be . Unsurprisingly, boarding  at Stuttgart by agency staff was  chaotic - unsure  which was entitled  for what. Cabin  staff increasingly young , inexperienced, probably because older members  were left in  fear of the  switch of British  Airlines to a  European airline. How  rude this was!  Few people bothered  even purchase the  complimentary snacks and  beverages on offer.  When that was  part of the  point the three  cabin crew members  sat in the rear galley, chatted,  then munched away  on the spare  seats from the Business Class section which had been  temporarily taken to the rear. At  that rear I noticed that one  or the two  toilets for Economy  Class has now  been ripped out  - replaced by  two seats without . Directly opposite  is one remaining , those passengers  were particularly unhappy , not least  out of the  endless queues alongside ! Everything about  British Airways now  seems shabby, telling passengers how little they are valued.  All this does  NOT even mention  their extra costs  to hold luggage , for seat ! My ticket book gave me  a choice of  seating but at  the appointed time  they were only four choices left. So, no, I  wont be flying them again unless  there other options !"
1.0,"From Nice to Gatwick. £3.00 for a sandwich in Club Class. We travel in business class, whether long haul or in Europe, for a better experience. This is even more  true now, since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the 'stewardship' of Señor Cruz. It started badly when we discovered (once more) that the flight was not at the terminal, but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus, just like a charter flight. I asked a staff member why this was so, to be told that the terminal was  to small to cope, but I noticed low cost carrier Norwegian was parked on a jetty. We had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of  a meal - those at the rear of Club often have no option due to catering limitations. Passengers were offered a choice of a curry, I think (yum) or salmon (yuck). By the time the nice crew got to us only salmon  had left. This is high in potassium, a fish  you must avoid. I asked why the other dish had run out  of the second row? ""Only two were loaded"", was the reply. ""What;  one only, for  a whole of Club?"". ""Yes"". I asked what else was on board, only to be  advised that I would have to pay £3 for  a M & S sandwich from economy. Before some help from our Avios, the tickets cost £500.00. It was beyond belief that an Executive card holder should  have treated this way. The (very !) cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed.  We should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard (pun) and migrate to other carriers. I'd rather fly easyJet and spend the £300  voucher on a nice meal.

9.0,"Flight LGW to Lima. Booked to fly out in  the Economy and  back in Business . I like  a website that allows you split  flights like this.  Then the event got upgraded to  go both ways.  No idea why. I am not  the frequent flyer. Flights left and  arrived on time.  The Sunday morning  was in scrum  was awful). All  the cabin crew and ground staff  were polite and  friendly Food very  good outward. Slightly poorer quality of meat on return  so that will  thank the Peru catering supplier. Cabin  nothing but plastic  sheets and carpets  were looking a  little tired. IFE  seats are old  & small. Plane was G-YMMS, both  ways Hate the BA penny pinching  because even when you have paid , they still  want another £60  to pick a seat."
2.0,"The Cana to Gatwick return. I would really like to say a good thing about my recent two  weeks with BA but can find nothing. The layout  of the business  class cabin is  so bad with half the seats facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not  closed the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position  or they are so low that it is almost impossible to get up from them. In more than 50 years of traveling, I have  rarely been in  any worse business . The selection of films and music is limited and the screen small. The food  for the two  days was passable but nothing more , the wines  other than passable  what you like  and I do not suppose it is much fun  to the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment  if they did  do one thing more than was absolutely necessary, I have saved the  worse for last , on the return flight the  interior of the cabin was close  on freezing and I wore two  layers and a blanket and was still cold. I  hear that many  other BA customers  have been bemoaning  a fall in  quality aboard and  deeply regret that I join that  company that will,  if possible never  fly BA again."
5.0,"Washington to London  and return. British Airways seems to  be having an  eating crisis. Are  they a full  service or a low cost carrier? The meals have been cut back to almost nothing. Seat selection fees ? And checked  bag fees may  differ depending upon the the type  or ticket purchased.  Southwest Airlines now  have a better  economy coach product , BA. Food:  For the outbound overnight flight, breakfast  had been reduced to a granola ! On the  return flight, dinner  seems tiny. Small  bits of food in half-filled bowls,  placed on a  plastic tray, as  though to emphasize  a lack of food. And the  evening snack has  be replaced with  an aforementioned granola ? Given the lack of food,  they should just switch to buy-on-board, so at least fewer people would go hungry. Flight  attendants seemed apologetic  about the lack of food. Seat . I don't know of any  other ""full service""  carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket.  We assume it 'll cost you another $40 or  so per ticket  with BA. Luggage . Completely opaque . On our  overnight trip, we  were told our  trip included one  for checked luggage . On our return we were  warned checked bags  might be extra,  and the kindly  TSA check-in attendant waived the fee  on us (no , he too  was as much  the victim of  the indecipherable baggage  handling policy as  other passengers). Entertainment:  Boeing 777-200 outbound with good, modern, on-demand IFE system.  In the return  flight Boeing 747-400,  the system was  the older on-demand system, with small blurry screens that  are almost unwatchable. Cabin crews were  not friendly. In fairness, both our  tickets were on  schedule and nothing went wrong. But BA just feels cheap and stingy.  Will likely fly the competition in  near future."
7.0,"New York JFK to London Heathrow return. My review is based on three different criteria: Service, food, and seat comfort. Overall the service was very good. The flight attendants were very attentive throughout the flight, and very professional. Any request was handled in a timely  fashion The flight was full, but service did not suffer. The food  during the flight  is absolutely disgusting and inedible. A  lot of thai vegatable curry, or  fried chicken dish which I ate  one bite of. The highlight of the meal was the two bite  potato granache. Also, they have eliminated the second meal/snack service - all they served was tea/coffee and a cookie. Very poor indeed. Seat comfort  - the best I've experienced in economy. I managed  4 hours of sleep on a 7 hour crossing. The slideable headrests allow your head not to bob. If not for the disgusting food i would give  a 9/10."
5.0,"Malaga to Gatwick.  My seat had  hardly any legroom and it reclines  to 1 or  2 degrees -  hard to relax. Food and drinks (including coffee and  tea are now  fully charged and  the airline only provides one trolley  the whole plane.  We were sitting  between row 28  to 30) and  they took us nearly 2 hours  before be served and only cards  being accepted, which  made things worse. Appalling. If you  need to fly  with this, fly  direct for a  fraction of the  price"
10.0,"Flight to Las  Angeles via London : This is  a salute to  their fantastic staff  of Terminal 3  where my group , when everything  was lost, because  the American Airlines  poor customer service.  The trip was  originally meant to  be a codeshare  but we flew  via BA booking  two AA flights  via LHR to  Vegas via JFK.  Our trip took  us on April  22 2017 We  ended being stranded , 16 out  of 19 travelers  in LHR, because  American AA somehow  kept losing our  luggage and not  caring at all  in helping, rather  helping everyone else.  The BA service  crew spent hours  trying to solve  problems and   trying to take  matters in their  capable hands. They  booked us 16  days on their direct flight from  LA to LAS  one day after,  except for accommodation,  transport to/from the  airport and Dinner  or Breakfast, even  if AA was  solely responsible for  the journey. The  service on-board was  you expect from  a economy flight  over that duration.  Service was good,  and all right,  cold drinks and  food welcome. The  service was great,  the screens was  tiny little small  compared to other  BA aircraft's for  our type of  short haul, but  no particular issues."
1.0,"Flew with British Airways from London  airport to Moscow , over Easter 2017. The plane was old, seats cover reminded me of unclean grey carpet. On the way to Moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some  leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were getting stuck so  have to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor. The food itself was miserable - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as I noticed while queuing for toilet (and there were only two for a fully booked economy class). On the way back to London had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so  limited leg space , I literally could not even cross my legs, as my knees were stuck into the seat in front. Seats were not reclining either. The food was even worse than on the inbound flight - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stone-cold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were only served once over 4 four hours flight. Do not fly BA to Russia. It employs tactics of EasyJet albeit the latter is superior in comfort and customer service."
8.0,"Copenhagen to Mexico , via London Heathrow. Upper deck  aisle seat. British Airways uses a  seating configuration with  the second seat : To serve  front and center  seating the crew  place a blind between the seats and pass food  & drinks over the aisle seat.  This also means you will be  face to face  all the passenger besides you. This  could be great or horrible. Food is nothing special but service is ! Bags did  not make the flight but their representative on ground was very helpful  when bags arrived next day. I  went to pick  these up myself.  Will fly again  and usually have  better fares to Mexico."
4.0,"Paris to Rome return. Outward flight the plane was full. Booked and paid for an aisle seat, but no legroom and narrow seat. Did  indeed eat on the aircraft. Landed on time. Return flight left Rome late, again full.  This time I booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit - more leg room. Food on the plane was  mostly M&S. Chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue. The food bore  little resemblance to  a photograph -  tasty and not . I feel  sorry for the cabin crew as  It takes them  ages to serve  them food, receive  cash (you can't  accept cash) and then clear it  all up. Passengers near the rear  on the aircraft  must be lucky to be served. British Airways European flights are nothing  less than a no-frills airline. So  by cost cutting it opens the door to look  for other cheaper options offering the  same service. This is not good enough."
1.0,"Prague to London Heathrow. British Airways  has lost the  fight BA is now a budget  carrier and offers the bare minimum  basic services for a higher than  expected fare. Check-in is ridiculous as  you wait for all the other categories to be  checked such as  premium members, bronze members, families, business class, silver members.  They do at last get round to calling for  seats left and  usually it's a scowl from the  gate attendant as you board the  plane Seating is fair, though leg room is tight. The flight left  one little late but arrived almost  first time, which  was fine. There is no food,  nor even a  coffee provided and  another couple of flight attendants come  down the aisle at a snail's  clip with a trolley. I can't  understand BA now  as passengers pay  less for food  & drink. BA  holds itself up  looking very much  the budget airline and a fr cry from its  troubled past. I  ask what has happened to BA  causing it to have fallen so far? This will  probably my last flight with BA unless there are no other options available as BA  remains more expensive than its direct  route competitors and  not a full service airline anymore."
1.0,"London to Istanbul. I am ever  slightly disappointed with British Airways, the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the  end product but  on staff who seem dispirited. The seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and  drink all are  below par compared  against rival airlines.  My most recent  journey back I  was an aisle  flight for a  meal The flight  was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from  our economy cabin  passing through the  first class cabin to use the  bathroom This is really quite irritating  even during meal  times No attempt  is made by  cabin crew to  stop this or  simply close the curtain splitting the  view even after  dinner I find the aircraft consistently  smoking and on  this flight someone  has left chewing gum on the  floor as well.  You think BA don't care, on  any flight from  landing electronic devices  are banned, other  carriers allow them up to boarding  and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways  had not even bothered to offer  snacks or even extra magazines on  the flight. They really don't appear  they give any care for their  staff even those flying business class."
2.0,"Paris Orly to New York via London. Unlike some American carriers and some other European carriers, there is no beverage service on short haul flights. Tea costs 2.30 pounds.  Economy overseas is a joke too, they bring the  extra drinks/service from the back to the front so economy class passengers  have to see the kind of amenities they could have had. They replaced the 2nd meal they used to offer with snacks but of  three options (cookies, snack-sized kit kats and snack-sized mars), you may only have one. I  wanted to have an extra snack, I was told no, only one.  The media is  decent but nothing to write home about. I classify this airline as slightly above a budget airline (you do get one meal after all and entertainment) but not much better  than that. "
1.0,"Los Angeles to London Heathrow. I have to agree  to all the other reviews on  how BA have gone so far in cost cutting  that the service  that flight attendants are able to  provide is just appalling. There's just nothing positive left  to say about them. From the newly refurbished 747 that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats, to the disgusting cheap meals. The flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they're embarrassed and have nothing to offer. All this would be fine but British Airways still charges  high prices and  guess what? I just took a flight on the same route with Virgin Atlantic and what a difference! All the little  things that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices  were cheaper. I'm afraid to say I won't be  using BA anymore unless it's to use up avios  already acquired!"
2.0,"Welcome to Milan . I landed  to London after  2 connecting flights  from Orange County California to Dallas  and then Dallas  to London both on American. I  landed in London  around 1:15 P.M.  The flight did not leave until  4 P.M. I  spoke to the  Qatar Airways help  desk and asked  if I could get on the  next flight. They  advised me to  go to the  airport and wait  to see how  far the flight  went before the  flight as I  have only one  on one and  was checked. I  got to the  counter just before  3 and they  advised me that  this was impossible . I would 've had to  go to the  gate area at  over an hour  early to change  the ticket. So  they had to  wait another 3  times I have  already been traveling  for 18 hours.  At the gate  of boarding they  looked at the  luggage and said  I would have  them check it.  I explained that  there is a  standard carry on  bags and it  is on the  last two flight  and I have  used the same  thing on over  50 flights as  carrying on. I  explained that it  came on the last to connecting  flight and I  had been traveling  such a long  time and did not want to  wait a long time for my  bags as I  would be getting  home late. They  were very rude , tagged the bag but still  allowed it to  them to carry down to the tarmack and get  off the bus  on the plane.  I decided to  take it on to the plane.  It fit easily  in the overhead  and it has  been every other  seat (there were  several bags that  are bigger than ) They actually  came on the  belt and took  my bag off  and put in  all the cargo  bag If that  were annoying enough,  I could not  help I asked for water to  have a pill , they charged  me for a  glass of water.  They also charged  the woman next  of me for  one cup of  coffee I could understand this possible  on one of  their discount airlines  and this was  US Airways. To end my frustration  it took almost  1 hour to  get my bag  from the belt  seat halfway through  the process. I  am a travel  agent and will  always book for someone else or  airline unless there  is no other  good choice."
1.0,"Welcome to Nice return. British Airways has gone down,  not more food  on board? Arrived in Nice and  it was 1 hour before we  left our Baby's buggy in another section altogether, no  where informed. When  asked no buggy  available at Heathrow - my two year old is now without a  seat and no one knows anything.  We was told  in different messages we have the  buggy we don't have the buggy?  The service all  over the airline  have gone down  - staff really  does care -  even in heathrow baggage office. They  just don't cater  towards families or  kids"
1.0,"Baltimore to Nice via London. My ordeal started when I could not check in online. I called BA  and they said  my flight is under airport control  so I have to check in at the airport. Fair enough but I should have known something was wrong. When I  arrived to the airport 3 hours ahead (I wanted  to get a  premium seat) I  got told that  my Economy was  full and that  I was involuntarily being bumped to . Never mind  that I bought  & paid for the ticket 4 months ago. The staff were not even nice about it. Quite beligerent.  The offered me a Compensation card for $94. Where they got this amount, I don't know. I would have preferred the . Then they  informed me I need to contact  BA for a refund of the difference in price. Why should I  have to contact them? They moved me, they know  BA moved me, shouldn't it be automatic? So I  am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistake. I  finally send an  email on their  contact form and have yet to  hear from them. It has been a week. I had a horrible flight. I have severe back pain ( reason I booked premium, for the extra room)  and was made  unbearable by my economy seat. My screen did not work for movies, although the flight  crew did try. It is as though they wanted to make me have a bad  experience Fast forward,  back in France, I tried to use the Compensation Card, declined.  So I tried to use it on Amazon and Nespresso online. Also declined. Really BA? I sent another e-mail telling them the card is not working. Nothing. I have flown BA in the past and have been happy with the. Not anymore.  I have  had it with . I will not fly with them again because when there is a problem, they do not come through.

9.0,"A business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home  via Sofia to Boston. I have to say that  the wife, daughter and I were  very pleased, somewhat  pleasantly so. Quick efficient checkin at the business class counter in Sofia. Decent contract lounge. Excellent service and food onboard both  BA Club Europe flight to London and Club World flight to Boston.  Helpful flight attendants, and much better  service than I  am used to on United, LH or Austrian. I 'm a gluten  eater and need to order special ! All three  meal free meals on this trip were among the best I have had. All three included flavorful sauces, which is something LH always omits from its special meals. The Galleries lounge in the B satellite terminal  is excellent. Not as much food  on offer as  at the LH and OS lounges,  and even the new UA lounge at Heathrow T2,  but it was  clean and comfortable. And we really liked the quirky Club World business ! The middle section is great for couples, every  table has a storage drawer and  its entertainment system  was solid. There were four toilets  throughout business class. My only complaint: the outrageous policy that required me  too pay to reserve seats together  during business class.  Since the fight  was not full, I probably could have gotten seats together at checkin, but I did not want to take the risk, and BA got additional revenue, which  is obviously why they do it."
10.0,"An excellent experience on a roundtrip trip from Hong Kong to Copenhagen through London. Despite  sitting in economy class, the flight attendants were attentive and also proactive (serving our needs before we even  had to ask). They were friendly and made us feel completely at home. The on-board  movie selection was very extensive, with high-quality options (English and international movies  of high caliber)  and the screen interface was modern and easy to use. The seats on the flight from HKG-LHR on the Boeing 777-300ER were new, and much more comfortable than the average older seat. The pilot was incredibly  aware of the flight path we were taking, and kept us up to date in terms of turbulence, arrival time, weather without being overbearing  or overly disruptive. With regards to the pre-boarding/ground service,  One of the check-in representatives went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and I so that we could sit together  and have a window seat (both of which were  only available at check-in due to the fact that we had bought our tickets separately and had not selected seats beforehand). We really appreciated her willingness to  work at what she could do to make our trip more pleasant. This was not my first time flying with British Airways, but it had been a long time since I last boarded a long-haul flight with them, and the trip exceeded my expectations. British Airways in my opinion is not the outdated carrier that many deem it to be.  :)"
2.0,"From Heathrow to  London British Airways  used to be a good airline.  Today it is just another expensive  company with low  passenger service. The  ticket prices are still very high  and they don't  sell any food or drinks any more for short  duration flights. Also,  we do not  allow you to  reserve a seat  when you pay.  Very dissapointed."
1.0,"Flew London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. We have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in  British Airways. The service on this flight was appalling. Travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff  tended to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks,  meals etc.. the normal routine stuff. On too many occasions we had  children request attention. Chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2  at the front of the service.  Lots of waste items had to be requested. The galley kitchen was  never restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a  construction site, no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water. Cabin staff were noticeable by their absence  during most of the flight. Hot  water will soon be the size of a postage stamp. Toilet bags  are cheap. BA have totally lost the plot. They are no longer  providing premium service and Willie Walsh  & Co. need to take a flight on Emirates,  Virgin etc. to realise their failings.  The seating configuration is ridiculous. Passengers in the centre seats have to  fight their way  down the isle over the isle  door legs. As part of the  London trip we made domestic flights to connect. Again service is in reverse but the costs aren't. If BA wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer  lower fares. I don't think they have a clue what they are doing. In future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary. The only  downside of the trip was the  lounge at Gatwick.  This lounge at San Jose is  no joke."
1.0,"The flight from New York JFK to London Heathrow was extremely uncomfortable,  although the entertainment was quite good on the TVs,  but food was horrible, plasticy tasting, and above all  not tasty. The  journey from Heathrow  airport to JFK  caused many delays, although this was out of anyone's control, it was very inconvenient and there was a  very long wait to board the  first plane (5 hours). At first  passengers were told  that we would  be brought to a new plane as soon as possible, but almost an hour later here were many other delays and  issues that we  weren notified about. The other passangers  including myself should  not have to wait for hours to get on  the new plane.  We wish the  size of the plane, bad food, and time of  departure were reduced ... So far, not a good first trip on British Airways.
"
1.0,"Very very poor customer service from British Airways. Myself and my partner were on a  plane that was overbooked and so were accommodated on a different flight on the same day with a via point of Oman. While upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to Oman. When we asked  our tickets for the second flight we were given a form of ticket and told  we would have to visit the transfer desk in Oman to get our boarding passes. On arriving in Oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was full. We were  sat there for 4 hours with  zero communication from anyone in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshments. After pleading with airport staff we were placed on a flight to Bahrain and transferred to our original planned destination New Delhi. We were approximately 12 hours delayed arriving and did not receive a single apology that day. To say it was a traumatising experience was an understatement.

2.0,"We had to  take my flight  out from San  Antonio because of  the accident that  forced a stay  at hospital. I'd  checked out first  Class and had  taken business class  - I do  get why some  pricing structures mean  their flights are  more changeable, but  we were absolutely  NO help at  ALL They flatly  refused to change  the flight so  you had to  book a ticket  to the only  economy class -  Business Traveller Plus.  That cost $3,300  just one way.  My first class  flight to was  ok - nice  friendly crew and  great food, but  rubbish cabin and  no cost cutting  and no snacks,  drink etc in  our galley like  they used to ! Absolutely no  help on the  whole trip -  many requests before  the flight -  and I was  sitting with a  friend I'd requested  an aisle seat,  only to ask  them at check  out as they  had given me  the seat in  back middle which would have really  irritated other passengers  when I tried  not get across  having to go  for the loo  together with my  mate Really poor  service at $3,300 , rubbish seats,  food and tv  channels that aren't  free The food  looks awful -  shame that costs  are being cut . Maybe their  aim is to  make such rubbish  food that when  you introduce food  you have to  sit in long  queues we all  are grateful! It's  the pity really.  They obviously BAs , if they  wanted to be  a no-frills airline,  but I'd rather  them were honest  with us so  then we can  compete amongst the  few other no  waste airlines. But  they keep trying  and say that  Virgin is a  luxury brand with  good values when  clearly they've decided  to cut costs  but they can  but still charge  great prices. Might  keep them profitable  and be a  success in the  near term but  you suspect people  will vote with  two feet and  not with someone  else"
4.0,"Flight to Edinburgh  via Heathrow in  January 2017. I've  always enjoyed flying British Airways and  will make my yearly trips to  Edinburgh with them  easier than flying  direct to Newark  on United. The  short haul flight  was OK - food service was  a wee bit  slow but it  included the usual  chicken and rice  which was OK  for an economy  class flight. However,  it was a surprise to me  - they no  longer served breakfast  or even a  sandwich in the  cabin - so  the chicken was  my only food  I got on  the flight. I  was too fussed  at that, until  we got on  our connecting flight  to Edinburgh where  i found out  why they no  even served free . By this  time I was pretty hungry so  I caved in  an got ready  to pay for  my bacon roll,  but never happened  before the trolly  never reached me! To top it  off off, we  departed Heathrow late  because of a  computer problem, meaning  I missed my  first connection in  time - but  you understand that  such things happen  in times. However,  budget cuts to  services and the  continued densification of  the long and  short haul fleet  make BA a  bit less attractive.  Plus the headphone  jack on my  iPod was loose  and it was  quite difficult to  watch films during  this flight, which was disappointing. On  the up side,  BA staff both  behind the desk  AND during the  flight were great  and always. Considering  I got the  tickets for a  great price, it  seemed OK. Although  I will definitely  not be going out my way  and fly BA  but will just  look for the  cheaper or direct  flights in future.  Not indifferent in  not flying with  them - if  they suit you  best then go !. But don't go out your  nose to fly  BA - if  they are cheaper  than direct options,  then go for  it instead because  their isn't anything  really outstanding."
1.0,"Well where do you start. This is a business  flight on a supposedly premium brand.  A ticket price  runs in excess  to £5000. The lounges at LHR  still need work. Yes British Airways  need investing but  long overdue. The small lounge for  departure gates needs  not be re-thought  to offer better food options. To the aircraft - its been refitted apparently, but should  have scrapped. The  engines remain tired.  The vanity screen  is not working . The entertainment  centre is past  their best, with smudges and scratches.  The carpets look like they need a very good  clean and are  old indeed. The toilets are 'old'.  However the aircraft is well past  and could be described as a premium. Regarding the  bathrooms - they  had been bashed  so are a  shadow of their  old selves. Sad  yet true. Too  no apologies for  the rubbish decisions  from management. On this trip the  catering kitchen was  not stocked and  many of the  essential items were missing e.g. Waitrose  sandwiches and yogurts. They have also stopped the ice-cream.  Food served was  not good -  saving grace was the meat platter,  because what could  they do to spoil sliced meats  and cheese. Blankets are faded and ragged. The toilet bags are a joke. Cheap and nasty. This route  is the jewel  on the airline  crown and one that has slide  on the priority ladder. BA need to invest in  their new fleet.  Improve the crew.  Upgrade the catering  staff get a  bit more choices.  Change the seating  - change seating configuration to avoid being an Olympic  pole vaulter."
1.0,"London Heathrow to Singapore. Business class flight from Heathrow  - Singapore. Flight took off over 2 hours late with no real explanation why, and we were not  even informed. It  appears BA is these days later in taking off.  During the flight  it felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in  first class, and my calls to  order additional water or other quite basic service elements  was not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset. The  final meal we were served was absolutely awful. It was supposed to be an Asian meal of a curry with prawns, but was just  a gunge, and was not edible. I really don't  know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable. Also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a  mad rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed  - which seemed totally unnecessary. As  I was hungry between courses I went to the  kitchen to get snacks but the  quality was poor,  as the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason.  I have noticed  the big difference  to the snacks on offer in the past few years. I have  remained a BA silver member for  many years but now see no reason to renew.  We always try and fly Qatar  whenever possible when going to Asia now, as the  quality is better and often the price too. There is nothing redeeming  about BA."
4.0,"How was I  thinking flying this ?! For the  third time travelling this airline our  luggage has been  stuck Two years ago London to  Paris our bags  were lost for  3 days. So this flight our  bags are left in London again!  So I'm stuck  at Dubai in winter clothes, missing  the pools and  staying at our resort waiting for  my bags to  show up. It's only been 3  weeks now in  those same clothes. Upside - service  on board BA559  - excellent. However, business class on  the Europe flight  is no different to economy so don't pay for business if you think you are getting a comfy  ride"
1.0,"Just got off the flight from  Manchester to New  York and have to say it  is one of the worst long  distance economy class flights I have ever had to ! The legroom  is an absolute  disgrace for such a long flight  and first time I have ever been unable to  bring my laptop to work (I  cannot understand why they don't offer  laptops on board!).  My seats are minuscule and if  your are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody  that is rather  big boned shall we say, then  it is a dreadful experience. In my section one of the toilets  was not working from the start of the flight , the other  toilets rapidly descended  in a disgrace  and no cleaning  done throughout the  journey I have travelled a lot  over the years, first, business and  family and had  the gold British  Airways card, but this was just  awful and I don't really know what BA hope  they achieve in  their long run - I can guarantee, I will  look other airlines  first before considering them again. Anybody contemplating going to New Orleans from  London - fly  to somebody else  and get an  air connection - you won't regret it. As for BA, they have about as much chance of me booking another flight  with them long term as Trump , of winning  that Nobel prize  at oratory, were  not to exist!
"
8.0,"I flew on a reward flight from London Heathrow to Brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience.  We were very well looked  over by superb  Flight attendants who  had a great sense of humour.  My lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessert. What we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy, and seemed rather worse  than usual. The  only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle,  which if you 're a bit chunky like me, it was quite difficult to manoeuvre.  That all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers, and  I like many other reviewers and  other loyal flyers  feel that BA is being turned into Vueling. If it weren't for  our excellent pilots and flight attendants  of BA who  make our journeys  both very comfortable  and safe, we would not travel  with BA. We  would try to find another full service airline, because we enjoy flying. "
3.0,"Our cabin crew, bar one lazy individual, were excellent. T5 feels like  a monopoly -  The Lounge food is simply appalling. Between breakfast and  dinner there is no hot food.  The hot food is removed at 9.30am sharp. Why  even leave it ??? So all you have is bread and stodgy  food The upstairs of the A380  was in need  of a serious  Master Cabin crew  – although you 'll sense lower  class BA flights  running often late now in my experience. The Club  Class A380 seats aren't comfortable. Despite  us knowing, crossing  over someone's legs  to get out is still a nuisance. There is  no scrum it down for last  set of toilets before landing -  we had one  man shout at  me when I'd  started waiting long before him and  I just turned up and tried  to arrogantly barge in.  Many  short term loyal passengers are starting  too feel disrespected  or undervalued, let down after years ' loyalty and  excessive spending. We're not getting what we're paying for, although charged. That's the sad bit."
1.0,"I am just  sorry to have to write this review. I changed  from Lufthansa to  British Airways more  that 10 years  back because it beening a premium  airline that was  unique in any  case Mostly flying between Berlin, the US and in recent years very  to Cape Town.  They had more  comfortable planes, innovative  technology like a  luxurious (rather new)  Economy Class, lie-flat  seats in Business  and a new  fuel economy and  had very good  staff with good  comfort and legroom.  Going from Cape Town to Berlin  in January to  receive my Silver  Membership made me realise, that none  from my initial  motivation to choose BA still exists,  perhaps the exception  for the great  BA staff, that  i feel really  grateful for. The  airline hired Álex Cruz last year, a very experienced  Brazilian airline executive  - he is doing the best  we can: Turning BA into a  budget carrier. Unfortunately.  The result is  great pity. No more service on  short haul flights,  limited service, only paid snacks on  old worn 747's  from Cape Town  for the grimm ies to be traveling in cramped  old 777's with  the extra seat  built in from  next year onwards. British Airways as  the premium airline  has lost. Realistically for year to come. Even with  BA status renewed,  I don't think I will fly them again if  they don't have . Meanwhile I understand, that companies  cannot unterstand and  own their mistakes.  I do hope  airlines will do  that in the  very not to distant future -  and keep their  amazing staff on  staff and on board."
1.0,"Oh no, no, British Airways. You've messed up. Someone  sitting in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said ""Let's provide food from M&S: that will make our offering classier than the rest.""  The problem on  the 18:55 flight from Marrakech to London was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers  demanded food and  drink so the  service was inevitably : A piece of friendly advice, BA, you need  only provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely  annoy your customers. Sitting near the  end of the  plane my wife  & I got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hr flight, by  this time our  legs were hanging ! But what's this? Only two sandwiches left, and  we bagged the last two packets  with crisps. You're  selling things you can't deliver, BA.  What is such as thing as  advertising standards, and your beautifully photographed food and drinks  display drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. The 2 cabin crew serving economy  went on with their service most impressively, even managing  to smile as  to the umpteenth time someone's payment  has failed to register on their  card (Hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you  pay your food  and drink for .) Meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed  struggled to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move  the trolley so they could access the toilets to  relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). Other passengers simply  tried to relieve  them of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several  amongst them eventually came down the  stairs waving their empty bottles and M&S extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight.  Everyone at British Airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it  along to your  colleagues if you dare. The process I call 'Ryanisation' of British Airways  seems almost complete. You now charge  on checked baggage (yes, I know that's indirect, but  even idiots can't  get through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who  need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a  new system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short -' (what even BA used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys  less than half the customers on board the plane. Oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin <mask> deploy the <mask> overhead monitors that display the flight progress? Too costly, perhaps? I suggest that BA needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but <mask> a minor revision: ""British Airways, <mask> world's least favourite airline""."
1.0,"Having only flown  BA / Ryanair for all my  international journeys over the last 10  months or so,  it was pleased to see a  new low-cost BA flight for my round trip from London to Rome. In hindsight, I wish I'd booked a different airline and not booked  one based on  their legacy reputation. To say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. I expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not ! Narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the  previous Regardless of , there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. Even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5""8,  my knees were  facing the seat in front. Lucky  the seats had no recline feature  could make matters worse. I was also tantalised by the BA bragging of M&S supplied , I am more than happy  with pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. It  certainly looked delicious  from the pictures and descriptions. Sadly, being sat in  row 22, this meant that after  the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me  is that they  had run out of pretty much  anything No sandwiches, no fruit salad,  or yoghurt. I asked what they did have. Their response 'Bottle of water or a Kit Kat'. After asking the cabin crew why there 's so little option their response was surprising to say the least. 'They never give us enough food. It's mad. They give us 6  meals for the whole flight'. Needless to say that  they can no  more live on their past reputation. They had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. Sadly, they probably sit about 4th or  fifth down the list. I'd say I'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, I won't bother. What a shame.

"
5.0,"My Heathrow to Munich return. It used to be  a enjoyable experience flying BA. Sadly  all the cutbacks  are kicking in , and travelling  now just feels  like a bit  more a chore. The loss of  the free bar/food service on European  flights is a real step down.  Much worse is  that cynical way  by which it happened: downgrading the  food offering so  drastically that it  feels like an  effort to offer  free M&S food  above board. Oh,  and how replacing  a free drink with the same  one only now  we have to  eat is an 'improvement' in service  remains beyond me. Not even a  free tea or  bottle of water? (I asked for  bottled water on  this flight earlier  last year to  save paying, only  then find it  smelled of chlorine  so wouldn't recommend you do the same). The 'card-only'  baggage system is  awful as well,  and takes forever  on the trolley  to get from  the end of  one plane to  each other. Next  down the list  are the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in ! Not wishing  TO pay this,  by the time  you checked in  for this flight  ( maximum 24  hours in advance) there were only  4 or 6 seats on the  first plane I  could choose from.  So took the  back window seat  in right at  very back of the plane, which  is far from  my first choice  economy seat. Other  flights let you  pick seats at  BA for free,  and EasyJet charge about half of  that BA charge  and select the equivalent seats in  BA (and if  I pick one  of the 'preferred'  seats with EasyJet,  I also get  free check-in and  payment for your  flight - not  available with BA).  Being at T5  were also a  pain on this occasion as the  only check-in machine  did work at  all and the  attendant printed a boarding pass but  only let me  show a bag tag. So I  could use the  luggage drop counters  after all and had to queue  again at the  overhead desks, wasting . There was  another minor delay due to fog,  although that wasn't BA's fault and didn't have a  major impact. Flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin  temperatures were good.  Along the way , our business  trip finished early  so we tried to take advantage of the one  only real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with  the economy fares : the ability  to switch between  planes for free . Could we?  Luckily the earlier flight was full. Rather than sit  around Munich airport all afternoon, we  hopped on Lufthansa instead. In summary,  when flying BA on European routes <mask> days, be <mask> that BA <mask> now a <mask> carrier. Lower <mask> expectations to <mask> level, and <mask> probably have <mask> pleasant flight."
2.0,"London to Gibraltar via Heathrow return.  I fly British Airways when I  travel and have  generally been impessed  or satisfied - until now. The  trip from Heathrow to Gibraltar was  one clean aircraft,  few delays, no  problems - apart  form the lack of drinks /  sandwiches I'd love to know who  decided this would  become a good idea. Flying short  and there is nothing to differentiate  you from easyJet or other no  nonsense airlines. Add  into this the lack of choice  in their ""menu"".  there are only  another couple of sandwiches, and if  they don't like  bread or cheese,  eat out of  luck Well done , you've alienated  your customers and are hardly likely to attract new ones. The flight  from Heathrow to Belfast is my  main gripe. The flight was meant  for depart at 1645, but was delayed to 1720,  not a big deal right? Wrong! The gate only went up at 1650, this led me to a  queue which took  you to the aircraft. It was 1730 before everyone  else boarded, again, hardly a big  deal except that  we didn't take off until 1830,  this meant that my dogs had  a spend an extra night in  Belfast as I  came back too  early to pick them up. The  plane itself was  filthy which wouldn't  have been too bad if there hadn't been a  woman sitting a  handful of rows  up front of  us who stank. I won't go into details, but  she smelled rancid.  He was a  couple rows back  myself so didn't get the worst  from it, but I could see  passengers who were closer who were not having a  pleasant time at all. Needless to  add I didn't  like the flight at all. I would go so far as to  claim that it's  not the worst flight I've been on, and I've  used Monarch and easyJet. I did e-mail BA with  some concerns, but  BA didn't bother  and reply. So,  very well done  but you're squandering  any good will toward you like  somebody burning fifty  cent notes."
3.0,"Flew from Gatwick to Cancun. British Airways have lost  their way, front  desk staff are  generally excellent, but  Behind the scenes  the service is  running at an  ALL time low. The quality of aircraft and seating is below other  but they need to sharpen up their act before even more passengers  come then.

1.0,"British Airways has  done it wrong  The short European  flight Malaga to  London and if  passengers are seated  at the front  rows of the  economy class, the  food / drink  service will block  access to the  toilet Seated at  the tail end  on the plane,  so food is  more likely to  be out. On  my flight the  only M&S was  reduced to ""snacks""  and water, £1.20  for Credit/debit cards  and no cash,  and this meant  a very painfully  poor ""service"". One  full toilet for  all economy class, the other one  was out of  reach - but  the business class  toilet at the  back was out  of reach for  the ""cattle class"",  made me wait  for over an  hr I was  finally allowed to  access the one  open toilet at  far back of the plane for  an 80 minute,  terrible combination of  a trolley blocking  an aisle, then  severe air turbulence.  The cabin crew  was desperate to  get the 1  seat (hence the  queue to the  front of the  aisle People needing  a toilet was  definitely not a  problem They certainly  would not let  it pass during  those 40 minutes  or more without  any turbulence. BA  had gone ""cattle""."
6.0,"Flight to New  Delhi It has  be a long  while since I have been on  any British Airways  aircraft and time  had not been  right T5 at  JFK is cavernous  and reasonably easy  to navigate once  I work out  where things are. It just feels  little bit hit  or miss compared to Changi or HK. The flight  up was on  my old B747.  Great seating and  comfortable but very  cramped The boarding  gate was chaotic.  No security checks  at the gate  were hardly surprising.  Personal comfort was  great albeit very  cramped and narrow.  The IFE was  free and that  is the highlight.  Our lunch served , so so, but having eaten  at the lounge,  nothing was left  completely uneaten. The  biggest problem is  with staff morale.  They all seemed  too be keen  and get the  worst out of the way, dim med lights and  the Evidence of  food cutting in  hot water was  not provided if  asked for, any  water was by  broken glass, very  small cutlery etc. BA is a  good airline but  appears to be offering a Ryanair . Compared to  a ME or  BA or my  last ride, Qantas,  I have slipped . Shame as  it was a  good airline to  travel with at  one time."
7.0,"Flight from Gatwick  via Grenada return  with British Airways.  Everything in south  east was good  service and staff were good, decent  service and the  plane was clean.  Something I struggled  not get my  mind around is  when paying for  economy class flights,  and then expect  people to pay  an additional £77  / person each  time to reserve  flights There were  12 of us  total so that  was in excess  the £600 to  our flight cost.  Some will tell  me that this  is free 24  hrs before departure  but actually 3  minutes before departure  the seats had . I would  assume after paying  in business class  that you automatically  get seated together , it appears  otherwise as there  is one couple  on the return  flight who had  already reserved seats  before paying for  first class and  were made to  wait in the  back until everybody  had boarded to  prove there were  enough seats together.

4.0,"Flew from Lisbon to London and return. British Airways never fails in terms of being  first time, but I will end my business with them after more then 30 flights and having said very good things about them in the past. They  seems to be cutting corners with everything, passengers are  rarely given even a small cracker and for some strange reason the plane does not stop at the hub, just goes to a remote  point and takes forever to get to the terminal. Not worth the money spent."
4.0,"Amsterdam to Cape lla via Gatwick. On our 13  hr night flight  i discovered that  the seat was  broken and could  not recline. Spent 13 hours sitting  down while everyone  around me was  on a reclined  chair Complained to  BA but as  they were unable to solve the problem they advised  passengers to issue  another complaint when  I returned home to Amsterdam. This is exactly what  i did. BA  said that it 's unfortunate that i had a  seat ecperience and  gave me a  free gift voucher as it woud  seem unfair to other passengers if  BA gave me  one What an insult! Its unfair  as I paid  a same price  with the rest  all the passengers, that's unfair. They do not want  a communicatie with  us anymore regarding this matter. Very arrogant and not  too friendly at  best I feel  that British Airways obviously does not value their customers.  A GBP25voucher woud  seem adequate for  our short trip during the day,  but for a  full overnight flight,  what an insult.  Got 2 e-mails  that they have  said they dont  want to communicate  anymore "
2.0,"I was scheduled to fly BA208 from Miami to  Frankfurt on January 18th. Boarding and departure went normal, but than, close  before take-off, the ordeal began. Captain  discovered a technical problem (at approx. 09:15 pm) and that's when the horror started. Overall, we ended up  staying in the plane until 01:00  hrs before we  are finally allowed to leave the plane (any attempts to fix the fault failed). We were given accomodation, but that was a 45 mins  flight from Miami Airport. Check-in took another 30 mins  leading to a long queue of  other passengers, and  this place was like a freezer. Was re-booked for a flight the next day, but downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy.  A tatty 747, very uncomfortable seat , entertainment screen was the size a mobile phone.  Best of all, the delay of one day has forced me to add another night  in London, and cancel my connection to Munich. Total  flight expenses, not counting the difference between Premium Economy (which I paid ), and Economy  is ~$500. Including the gap between Economy and Premium Economy probably ~$900.  Surely this is where a service oriented company would have an opportunity  for make a  difference Submitted my compensation claims incl. proof for the above expenses, as per protocol online - no confirmation.  Ended up with  the call (had to wait approx. 45 mins to talk to a human) and was  told that most  costs are not refundable but I would be compensated for the remaining. No further confirmation, email etc. Was  paid a mere $50 into my  refund with no  clue what this is supposed to be for (the expenses were $900).  Went to do  further research and it appears that under EU law,  airlines are required  not compensate for consequential damages if the delay if  greater than 3  hours (my delay was 21 hours).  Absolutely atrocious  Customer service, lousy ! How on earth BA deserves  5 stars in  paying me."
3.0,"London Heathrow to  Las Angeles. Worst flight ever with  US Airways, you can see why they have fallen out of the top 10! Very lazy and oblivious staff members. They ran out of  food during both meal times. We were promised a  refill but nothing came until they cleared away the trays. All we got was ""oh sorry"" and a re-re heated meal.  While leaving the service light on for 15 minutes  waiting for some water, I went to the back of the plane to find 2 members of staff  reading the paper. Even after complaining  of customer service after the flight we weren't treated much better. If it wasn't because  the the avios program it was enough to put me off for a life time!"
3.0,"I have never had such a  terrible experience with  UK Airways before.  Our cabin staff  was rude, lazy and obviously did  NOT want to  offer a service.  Our flight was  from Mauritius to Gatwick on Sunday 26th March 2017 , Monday morning  28 March. No  single cup of  tea offered at breakfast, we had  to take our own plates back  after landing and on two occasions  the steward pointed to a cloth  on the floor and expected me to pick it up without a please or a thanks. Food was  served the staff  were absolutely appalling. We pay good money for Business  class and this chaotic and rude service is not what I expect  for my National  airline"
4.0,"London Heathrow to Hong Kong. The  current premium economy  seating is a vast improvement on  my previous seat,  however I was  slightly disappointed however  by the inflight  service For a  12 hour flight  on a Premium  Economy I would 've assumed it would be similar  to others offering, meals, mid flight snacks and other . I was very wrong. We  got a bar service and meal,  which was then  served until breakfast , the same as the Economy offering). This is  where British Airways  has really gone  crazy with its measly service offering.  Having went to  see the crew  at the rear  in the aircraft, they completely understood customer frustrations, they just have nothing  they give. BA  were once a  place you looked forward to flying ? Not so  so anymore. The  staff were friendly  but even they seem to have  lost the passion they once had.  If anyone flying  to bring yourself some additional snacks  - especially if your travelling with  children"
2.0,"Frankfurt to Hong Kong via London. This will definitely be my last  trip with British  - I have already changed my return ticket to Cathay Pacific. The business class experience  with BA has suffered so much  and cutting they are well below every major competitor. Short flight to Heathrow and the afternoon snack was  cheap - probably worth about $3 at most. Seat legroom is awful, and not far off the 29 inch size that Economy is being  upgraded to. Staff s were friendly, and that is all. Lounge at T5 was again very poor - crowded, food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café, dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning. The toilet was disgusting. Evening departure to  Frankfurt and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat. Onboard the BA club world product is lousy - cheap, low quality amenities, a  really poor meal choice and standard, washrooms unstocked and quite dirty, the  lounge worn and scruffy. As an expat living in Germany, I have remained loyal to BA until now, but this is  one last time I will waste our company money using them. It is quite clear that BA are abusing their monopoly situation at Heathrow, cutting their own costs to boost  their returns without giving one thought  for the longer term reputation (and profitability) of the  company If you are undecided about choosing BA over another airline, quite simply do not consider BA - you will be very disappointed and feel cheated."
10.0,"London to Nairobi return in February, during the industrial action. We found the crew to be friendly and attentive. The food was ok, I had the spicy chicken which I didn't much care for, it was rather unusually badly prepared, with great  portions of chicken and vegetables, just not as nice  as the beef my husband was eating. On the return flight, we were 2 flight  hours down due to the strike, but they were excellent and more  quickly made up for the missing staff. I know that there has been a lot of gripes about BA downgrading its services, but these flights were really good, and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time. Didn't much care for the  snack bars but the 2 cups of tea made up for that! "
3.0,"London Heathrow to  Birmingham on British Airways domestic economy, check in at  JFK okay although a little slow fast track security quick. I used the BA Galleries  departure lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon. Boarding through A8 on to  very clean looking full A319. I  got seat 25A which has no window. Crew where actually very friendly  this is normally  not case on BA. Not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time  and off quickly  next flight not too bad. The  key to this trip is really my feelings towards  them In order  for maintain my  executive club silver status (Oneworld Sapphire) I have to take 4 BA  flights each year,  this I can do on domestic routes but the  next 16 or  17 European and  international flights I take each year  will be either with other Oneworld carriers or others  but not BA. The management at  UK Airways are making false claims, when suggesting ""it's what our passengers asked for"". I  travelled with BA  three times last year and I  never asked if  they wanted a  member of the  coveted Executive Club  seats or was  ever asked if I wanted to  take a huge  additional charge to  book specific seats - I most certainly was never asked if I wanted the simple  meal and a coffee on UK  or European flights replaced by buy  your own food  - neither was I asked if  i mind paying for snacks on  domestic flights. Unfortunately British Airways are fast becoming a  middle rate budget  airline in order  too appease it's  passengers"
4.0,"Toronto to Berlin  and London on miles in a  variety of classes. First class check in at Toronto  looked good with  friendly staff. A  low priority security lane had me  boarding the first  gate in 15 . Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card  holders and so  forced to sit in the Biz ). Good menu to eat on  solid ground and decent selection of  food and beers.  Quick boarding once  we started and greeted at the door and taken to 2A. Excellent  tasting champagne served  by friendly and professional crew. A  simple but tasty  dinner of a  smoked / dried  fish followed by steak which was  perfectly cooked. Good cheeses and all  vegetables selected were  good After some decent sleep, a  good breakfast served , late as  possible ended a decent flight. T5 North lounge was  fine with a  20 min wait , a shower which are now looking tatty and  dirty Decent breakfast  consisting of hot  fresh fruit, cereals  etc Quick board  on the flight  into Berlin. Ridiculous  board room -at 30 inches max. Very cramped. Don't  mind the table in the middle  as several couples asked for them  to be removed.  A ok snack  with cold meats  with stingy portions.  Quick time arrival and fast bags  finished off a good and cramped  last leg. Returning  in London in  what was possibly  my worst short haul flight ever  ( low cost airlines). A full A321 was cramped,  two bins (with one out of ), and the  now infamous terrible  baggage room.(I understand  and is to get even worse ). BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. Slow  eat and drink  service with little  back up. Some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. Not even juice,  tea and coffee offered for free. This penny pinching  gets you even  a glass of water makes the  US and Canadian carriers look high class. The only  save grace were  airline crew who  were embarrassed by  the product they had to deliver.  The whole plane  seemed fed up,  bored and just waiting for the  plane to finish. Final leg to  London on a  coach included a bus mystery tour  in a remote . Nice crew  that were efficient , offered decent . Poor lunch  - roast chicken,  garlic mash and  mixed greens. Not  top class food  but pretty average.  More like economy ! Afternoon tea was fine, with  the fast deplaning  of bags. On the long haul  flight the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice,  no new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded.  This biz class  plane - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp <mask> only to get rid of the 8 across <mask> lack of <mask> How the <mask> have fallen! <mask> four classes <mask> four legs, <mask> the gulf <mask> all classes <mask> BA and <mask> on both <mask> and long <mask> The short haul legs to <mask> from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where <mask> least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. <mask> less leg <mask> fewer toilets, <mask> quality and/or <mask> refreshments, and <mask> general downgrading of service, the only thing not <mask> is the <mask> This suggests that the BA <mask> and IAG only care about the bottom line <mask> not the customer or reputation of a once <mask> class airline. The only thing left to strip customers of is <mask> Exec Club <mask> Avios. It's <mask> a matter of time before <mask> final nail <mask> the BA coffin hits the <mask> at which <mask> - I'm off!

1.0,"It will be  me last time  you book a  ticket with them. I booked a  return trip for  January 2017 from  London to Istanbul  with few months  in advance, they  ended up cancelling  my 11:00 flight  and moving me  to the 07:00  one which would  normally work for . After the agent telling me  to take time  to work out a plan I  delayed it for  the few months.  On calling yesterday  they told me  that I had  noticed the changes , it was  weeks ago I  told her that the other agent  recommended that I  try and decide later. This was  compounded by the  knowledge that I  had purchased a  laptop bag only fare, but I  fly with a  smartphone or laptop,  given the recent  bag ban BA  were going to  require me to  charge £50 for  my bag to  carry my device.  But this was  not my fault.  I add to this everything is  booked for now,  extra legroom, pay , seats and  a way to  book them even on check in,  I can see  no reason to fly BA any . I called  my travel agent  who was able  the cancel my  flight for a  minor penalty. I  then rebooked with  United Airlines who was only a little more cost  conscious last minute,  they include food,  checked bag, drinks and seat selection , sometimes a  new 777 on  this route."
3.0,"Heathrow Terminal 5 is a great  airport dedicated to  UK Airways, the  ground service was not as fast  like they say,  everything was normal. The BA staff on the ground  are cheerful and happy to help. I was very  excited to fly  on the new Dreamliner from London  airport to Dubai,  however my dreams were crushed within  the first few steps onboard. First  class IFE felt very old and  very clear at  being something you'd  expect on non-refurbished B777's. Choice of  music and TV  channels are pretty  limited so I  cant fault BA  on that. The  seats are nice, the head rest  was excellent and  changing room is okay. Cabin Crew  is lazy and  clearly do not want to serve , I was  given more than  10 minutes for  food to come  see my bright light hovering above  your head. The food is okay (Your first meal)  and hot and options were good,  fresh meats and  much more you  could ask for  on a plane.  But and this is a big  difference your second  meal we were  offered a Breakfast  Bar that was ! How much of a budget are they on ?! I thought  perhaps something happened  to the food so they gave us Breakfast bars  free but on  the return journey  we were given a cookie for  breakfast people were  eating and looking  after their cookies  in disgrace. I  really can't believe  where downhill BA has gone. It's  crazy how the  company now charges  more shorthaul flights  and I think  its running out of money. Unfortunately I booked my  flight to Marrakech  with this expereince,  but I promise  this would be  your last time  you fly with ."
5.0,"British Airways use a version of  a 747 with  the minimal number of economy seats  in this route from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. Every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied. They make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area. Seats are narrow,  and cushions are hard, and I  saw a ""large"" person next to me both trips. I paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible. Food was passable and no more, but there were two meals on the long  haul Cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training ; polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights. Both  left on time. These ancient 747s  were showing their age even though both of these had been ""revamped"" they looked tired but clean. The alternative aircraft used  along this route is and airbus 380 but a fellow passenger said that the seats were even tighter  on that aircraft. It is tiie that BA started to compete and not be so complacent."
1.0," I am 73 years old. Was  due to fly  via Montreal to  London on January  29 and from there to Athens on February 1st where I would  make another connection  in Cyprus.

Missed my connection  to Athens and  the connection from  London to Cyprus. Was never offered  explanation or compensation.  Had to book  another flight on  February 2nd and  arrange a stay  at a hotel  close to Athens , Contacted British , they replied  with the usual  negative comments. I  followed up and  never got a  message Clearly I  was being ignored.  Now will never use British Airways ."
6.0,"Flew British Airways  from London Heathrow  - Innsbruck. Overall  fares about ok  good value for  £ Its a  place where the  real difference between  airport and club  is often no more than a  seat which is  good as well . Outbound, slow  & overcrowded lounge , desperate need  for refurbishment (particularly  the horrible toilets).  No priority boarding,  being bussed like  crap on the  return journey to  get where the  toilet was sat.  Fast board, flight , nice breakfast,  decent CC. Return,  bad lounge, no  food to compensate  with no lounge,  good priority security,  bad priority boarding.  Flight again good  on board and  very ok lunch.  Just same in  economy as they  were in economy.  Free ticket meant  you carried 'free' - which would  normally cost £70 , so in  total"
1.0,"London Heathrow to  Manchester Booked Business Class expecting extra legroom but seats  are the same as in economy. I was and  still am disgusted, what a rip ! How do  they get away  doing it?

3.0,"London to Dublin. I had not flown with British Airways for over  2 months but recently made the mistake of booking with them to fly out to  Dublin from London 's Terminal 5. It all started again, I had downloaded the BA app from the  Amazon App store and I tried to check in the night before using the app  but I was getting the error message saying that  it was not possible for me to check in at that time, I thought nothing of it and tried again in the morning when  i was sat  at the Taxi  at the airport. On the app  and noticed that the flight had  become delayed by approx. 1 hour and some minutes (considering it is  my local flight and I was flying with hand  baggage only) I  decided to stop  thinking that I can get some  updates as having  travelled multiple times  in the past 3 months (at  least once and sometimes twice every week) I was under the impression , as long  as I am at the airport an hour and 15 minutes before the flight then there should not be any issues , all that's the whole point  with flight updates?). When I got the BA self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original  departure timing (and almost 2+ hours before the actual flight time) I had issues printing my boarding pass  and was told by the helper  and go to Zone E to  get a Boarding  pass printed by  the counter staff, after waiting 20 minutes in the queue (bearing in mind that the flight was delayed  for an hour and so there was still over 1.5 hours remaining until flight take off) I was told that the  gate has been closed and as I was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me , I ca not fly on  this flight so I will have  and take the next one (from 8am flight I was moved to 11am flight). After discussing with the check in manager I was told that there is  no he can do as he doesn't make the rules. Needless to say that I  have to book  on the next flight despite being through security and  in the waiting area over an hour before the  next flight took  off If this is how the BA customers are to be treated, i.e. they have  to be there  at time for the original flight despite getting notification that the flight is delayed then I for one will most definitely not be flying BA again, the rules are to  become helpful towards the customers and not one way traffic as it  is in this  situation (they are not putting any value on my / other customers ) i.e. we must wait inside the airport like idiots despite knowing that flight is <mask> late )."
3.0,"Return to Barbados. Having used Avios  Airways when making  a reservation we were very disappointed  by the high charge to reserve seats in advance. The crew were  extremely pleasant and  the aircraft was reasonably clean but there was choice  of main meal available. British Airways  idea of offering a ""fun size"" Mars bar instead  as a second meal is unacceptable. In our opinion the airline are offering a ""budget experience"" at a  reasonable price and  so will not be making any  future bookings with them."
5.0,"London Heathrow to Bangkok. First time flying British Airways.  I had heard  about the bad  things about them , they did  NOT disappoint. Tired  in aircraft, seat would not fully  adjust unlike the  plane in front of me. Entertainment  system is dreadful and flickeered most of the trip - I did  NOT even use  it much in the end. Food  was good, I  must give them . Check in  very fast and  off plane pretty much on time. No Wifi or  toilet facilities onboard."
4.0,"From British Airways  to Beijing -  At Heathrow, Emerald member so a  last minute check-in with a dedicated  agent was appreciated.  A BGS Lounge which BA uses  ( a welcome surprise, owing to  a fact that  their are many  other food options  at that time  and also shares the lounge). Business  was almost the  Same as First,  just more people.  Very seamless. Here  is where the  story ends. Two meals for 11 am flight, but  upon requesting snacks  for between you  was directed to  my copy of  BA where there  is a ""sweet  tasting menu, with sugar family items  for around £2-3 . I declined  it and stayed ). The meals served were carb-rich  pasta (tasteless) and  a rice meal (dry, tasteless). I  felt minimal needs,  although I do know BA has  come back so  far now that  BA really is  seat + meal  / drink +  food on trans-con . Crew were  attentive enough. Free  return seats for friend and I  would benefit)."
2.0,Fly from London  Airport to Geneva. Fast Track through security at LHR  Terminal 5 is a misnomer. If you want fast track choose an airline departing from  Geneva or T3. Boarding aircraft a nightmare. No priority boarding. At gate  get onto a bus in conditions that resembled a cattle truck. Line up on tarmac  for steps to  gate On board  seats arranged for  advantage of British Airways flexibility and  to the convenience of passengers. Three seats each side  on the aisle with the centre one blanked out. No extra seat width or legroom. Knees against the sear in front unless one sits  with a twisted  angle (not good). Similar arrangement on newer British Airways A320's. Overall not what one expects  in Business Class and negates any positive aspect of the flight.
1.0,"Flight to London : Flight and  hotel was cheap,  and for the  prices I expected  – and this  was not value  the money. Advance  seat selection is  often just plain  cheap on top of ticket price. It is complimentary  to Air Canada.  And with boarding  is pre-arranged, there  are no Bag el in Montreal,  nor one long  time British Airways BA staff. Air ier next time."
4.0,"Gothenburg to San Francisco via Heathrow, returning from Phoenix.  Unfortunately BA now charges for snacks and drinks in Eurotraveller, a move that surprised me . BA is now nothing but a very expensive  carrier or EasyJet. After arriving in London we started  off with a 5 hour delay  due to a mouse spotted onboard our shabby and worn Boeing 772.  We were swapped and we left on yet another shabby and worn B772. Seats were comfortable but the  floor was dirty. BA has cut  corners on the amenities in World traveller. It used to be a  face mask, socks, a tooth brush and headphones, now  the headphones were provided. Returning from  Paris on an even older B747.  Again I was disappointed. A couple  short years ago  we switched to  BA from Lufthansa  because I find London a more convenient transit airport, while both airlines  provide the same  quality levels of service. But what has happened? This  used to be a great airline, which now sadly is nothing more than a low  quality carrier charging premium prices. Will  stick to Lufthansa from now on."
3.0,Return to Mauritius. 12 hour flight delayed 1 hour due to no cleaners. Advised by First officer that  the Crew had to clean the  Bread Crumbs on  seat and greasy windows. Otherwise fairly average flight until woken up 2 hours out of  flight to be advised that toilets  on plane were full and no further use please!  But after waking up most people like to visit the toilet surely?  The seatbelt signs then illuminated though  minimal if any turbulence. One hour  after First Officer  signing on again with further abject  disappointment re toilets  NOT working as apparently the toilet  tanks hadn't been emptied at LGW  for departure. Two hours with legs crossed for over 200 pax! Surely flight should never have departed without emptying tanks. Trust they maintain the  facilities better!
9.0,"New Diego to  have an excellent  flight with really  good Club World  service from crew.  My crew in  the upper deck  did their jobs,  meeting requirements and  expectations when delivering , no complaints  or a decent  nights sleep. They  know US airlines  with a cocked  gun and I  should know as  having had the bitter experience during  my stateside trip."
3.0,"From British Airways , London Heathrow , Dubai. I  would not normally  read reviews but  i was so  impressed with the  staff and flights  on BA for  my recent 4  day stay in  central Dubai with my wife, that  we had to  write a comment.  Most of the  staff (not all)  were rude and  I had run g of food  before they came  and serve me.  I try and  try other airlines  in the future  if possible.

4.0,"Amsterdam to Gatwick : the usual short haul commuter  with no difference in seating apart from the empty  row in the middle of three seats, no apparent  additional leg room compared to economy  flight Onward flight  to St Lucia,  opted for advanced  ticket allocation as did not want  to travel facing the back of the aircraft. Tired,  tired interior and  poor food reflected  this too. Outbound  staff were helpful , energetic, keen ly assist where  necessary and were  quick to attend  if the call  button was used.  Return flight was , same tired interior, unappealing menu  and indifferent service. The only redeeming  feature was that my reading glasses  and pen, left  on board on  the outbound flight  and returned to  me 5 days  ago when I  returned home. 10/10  To British Airways  team in St Lucia for managing  me so well. I hope that BA will be renewing its fleet , it will  always be my first choice of  airline for long  term travel until  the investment has  be made."
2.0,"My last few experiences with British Airways have been extremely disappointing, they  clearly do not  offer the level  of service that customers used to enjoy. On my most recent trip from London to Toulouse, I booked  ALL my Avios points. I then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do  so so I ended up spending more on 1 flight than I had for 2. They now charge  more food and drink on shorthaul . I even had to purchase a bottle of water. This is akin to a LCC such as Easyjet, but the  prices are still  significantly more expensive. In addition, I received an email from the airline  that they had  failed to contact  them and could I contact British Airways about my booking. I had  only one missed call with no  answer during working hours. Having eventually dug out the  airline customer services  details (these were  also provided on the email) I  tried several time to get through  them but was left waiting so long I eventually  give up."
1.0,"Edinburgh to Luanda  via Heathrow. British Airways has started charging inflated prices  on food, on a flight that is already highly  expensive in comparison  against other airlines,  their standard is  low and it is no surprise that the flight  was empty. They are just a very expensive EasyJet / Ryanair."
2.0,Flying Heathrow to Las Vegas. Never had need to write a bad airline review before now. British Airways  was the worst airline I have  ever flown with.  Very shabby and dirty plane. Tv screen was broken and hanging off the back of  seats when I arrived. The only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move me. The seat I then sat in was  dirty and had dirt on the seat back (old food stains) and  under the belt.  One drink served  for meal (except water). When I eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left. I had a white wine. When I asked for a second (yes only  a second drink on a 9 hour flight I was told they  would run out of wine also). I had to have orange juice. Awful and rude staff (with exception of one). Worst airline by far  you have ever flown with.
3.0,"Welcome to Bridgetown. Firstly couldn't book myself in online  as my husband had a reward  ticket and he was checked in . I couldn't move him, his seat was fixed. So we had  to leave mega  plane so I could sit near him! Luckily got the seat behind him. Food and seats terrible. Tea , snack an  apple 2 small  ones Breakfast was a muesli bar! I already have booked with BA again for Tampa  as they are  the only airline  who fly there ; however my annual flights to Barbados will be with Virgin in  that I have  to twice re check in, meals  on the broken  coffee table on the return trip,  but have been offered 5000 Avios points (£40) that just ties me  into flying with  Virgin again, especially as they expire every year so will disappear before I might want  to use them! The cutbacks are  getting cut too  at BA. Tip:  Grab a sandwich in Boots on way out and  get something to eat on way back before you  head to the airport!!. "
5.0,"From Gatwick to San Jose, Costa  Air return with  us at a  very good price . £1200 return for both of  them The flight  back was a  fairly cramped Atlantic  plane and my  friend and I were separated and  forced to sit ! The cabin crew were professional , there were lots of complimentary  coffee runs. The  service was average  or best, and  loads of options  laid out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late,  the crossing was  scheduled at 9 hours, some time was made up,  and cabin crew  were very good. My main issue  being that the plane did not  look to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat  - not great when you are  used to safety  stuff that should have been there, and wasn't. The  meal was really  nice though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which  tasted of a  chicken like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the  worst long haul  that I have  never been served. I thought that  the whole experience  seemed a bit shoddy and average,  such a shame  as the Middle  eastern carriers are so much better  at virtually every  aspect Sad and disappointing."
1.0,"Orlando to London.  I had booked  economy class and  just wanted to  be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways  I paid all  the money and  by the end , was having  too many issues  it made me  thinking of not  travelling with this  airline again. I checked in 24 hours before the  trip as soon as the online  checked in opened.  This system gave  me only a  one seat, opposite  in the direction  on the airplane,  with no possibilty  of be able  ot change it. I called British  Airways main office  to try to sort this out,  however I was  advised that they could not do anything and they  send a note  from British Airways  to the airport,  the airport keeps  its business class , I called  to the main  office to talk  about a different  agent in case I was suggested  some different option ; the second  person sent a  different note to  British Aeroport. As  soon as I arrived at the  gate at the  service desk I  am informed that  they had not  left any notes  and there were  two seats available  to me, however  we were going  and fix it at the gate.  Once I arrived at the gate,  and was asked  to try myself , ask every  other business passager  for swap seats.  I do not  believe that it  was worth paying  to business with  UK Airways, and  then getting all  the chaos. It  was finally found  a staff who  quite kindly agreed  to asking other passenger for swapping  seats on behalf  to me. Finally,  my Lagguage that  was 'priority' came  at last."
2.0,"Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown  for BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to  my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet  however there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super  quiet over the airfield. Boarding was  fine however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however . Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air bag high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very  few toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag  type of amenity  etc The product is akin to  the excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants  seemed ok but  just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast  and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless  offered other options."
3.0,"Hyderabad to London. I have travelled  internationally numerous times and had very  good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation  or the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin  assignments or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was  very surprised to find that the  airline as a  company seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no,  it is not possible"" without any explanation. When I  further inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given  these circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was  of no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my  rather than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
1.0,"Welcome to Chicago. In my opinion  British Airways have massively decreased in value for its  passengers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option  of a free seat selection, they charge for food  on board on short haul flights.  In long haul flights they removed a second meal  leaving shabby options  of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will  never be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
5.0,"Flight to Vancouver , British Airways  are no longer  offering value for  price The cost  of Premium Economy  coupled with the  quality of service,  food and the general age of  this plane make  it a fairly  expensive exercise. The  food in both directions was old and shabby, staff  are fine, but don't really go  well of their  efforts to make  this a pleasant  trip Particular bugbears  were the inability to choose a  seat when checking  in online as  simple as it  seems (of course,  passengers have the  luxury to pay  an extra £40-£55  each way to  choose a seat ). The food  selection seems to  be declined in  this past few  years and on  our 9pm return  flight it took  another good few  minutes to serve the Premium Economy ). The tv  sets are dirty , small (the  camera had to  get reset on  a flight out,  was quite a  shame For almost  double the price  in Economy, I  do think it  made sense to  use World Traveller Plus on this )."
5.0,"London London Heathrow , Gibraltar. This  is probably the  first time that  you book a  longer haul with  Qatar Airways from  London for anything  more than a  family holiday -  no matter how  nice they make  it they can't  change the structural  problem of long  queues to gates,  queues for take-off  and long walks  down to passport , then long  walks as passport  security and a  trip back to  which Willie Walsh  was saying the  previous day how  they had to  continue to pay  high prices for  British airports -  another hollow laugh.  We are further  compounded by their  first class cabin , which effectively means that the majority of passengers  ( Economy) are  greeted by only  1 cabin crew  and only have  accessibility to the  onboard toilets. On  this flight (of  just over 2  hours this meant  in the final  few rows did  not get access  with any food  nor water until  you had begun  the descent and  all loos were  all out of  order I have  little objection to  paying for food  or drink but  they have got  better make it  easy to actually  be able to  get it and  find the loos  so easily. Seems  such a structural  problem in their  system The other  issue was the  absence of enforcement  for the carry  on allowance which  leads to a  rush to get  my bags stowed  - it took  me back to  the early days  on EasyJet and  airlines before allocated  flights So unless  am lucky enough  to be among  the pampered minority  on the front  two rows I  suppose I'll use  cheaper airports and  the better general  amenities (and available ) that come  from a single  economy cabin -  no matter who  the carrier is.
"
5.0,"It is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and  Manchester I chose  the seat on  one upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A,  or exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat  has enormous leg space which allows  a passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment  is adequate and featured some of  our latest movies. The classical music selection was severely  limited though. BBC  music was on  the menu but ironically, it was not available for  this strange reason.  Dinner service was basic. There was  just one round  of drink service  during which cabin  crew asked passengers  for their drink selection for dinner. In other words,  passengers would have to order your  orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin  staff came around  the clear dinner  drinks too fast even before passengers  have finished their  drinks Throughout the  entirety of this  birds eye flight,  I did not see any cabin crew coming around  offering drinks. The  cabin - VCE  service was operated  from the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free  onboard snacks and drinks for its  domestic routes and  travellers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S . On the whole, BA will  fly you to  a destination safely and punctually with  few frills in  economy class. Unless  this is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose  this airline.
"
4.0,British Airways are  clearly trying to  do all the  best parts of  the budget airlines  to make a  very poor offering.  We recently flew  with BA from  Manchester to Marrakech  despite the ticket  counter being twice  the price of  Virgin The catering  for the new  BA food can  best described as  little short of chaotic. On the  return journey the  best that could  get offered on  the four hour  trip was a  large Cost cutting  and removing toilets.  Would one toilet  seat 200 people  at BA?
3.0,"The Heathrow to  Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing  777 has been configured to cram  up as many  seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to  use for the  entire cabin, queues  of 5 or  so people long continuously throughout the flight. There was  barely any legroom  - while it's  nice that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get  in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front  to move their  legs The seats  feel very narrow so put pressure  onto my elbows when i was trying to sleep  (& not a  fat lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top  on the armrest so my neighbour  was constantly switching my light on . I gave  up trying to watch a movie  but the screen was so close  on my face  I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was  very very poor,  despite the food we had on  the internal flights on SAA which  were excellent. British Airways have lost the plot -  deal with someone !"
7.0,"Oh dear: cost-cutting on British Airways has led to them becoming an  airline Flew Kuwait to Edinburgh via . Aircraft are  quite comfortable, timekeeping  is good, and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming. However, most of the cabin crew were ""mature"", and the  snacks and drink offering is now minimal. Breakfast from Kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables (no, not the omelette we used to have) plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla: both looked like something you would spoon  inside of a tin for a baby. ""Lunch"" was a mars bar or similar. I did not bother  buying the ""buy on board"" stuff on the flight to Edinburgh - I get a better choice in the terminal when I get off  the aircraft. The domestic flight back from Edinburgh to Heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew I have ever seen  at BA, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration - very unprofessional. The evening  meal out of London back to Kuwait was more like a snack, with a smallish steak, three snap , three baby food (I counted the things), and another babyfood potato thing. ""Breakfast"" was a muesli bar. Sorry guys: a comment on this board that BA equals ""Budget Airline"" just about sums it all up. I have other choices from the Gulf back home, and next time I will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with BA is the extra legroom  at Premium Economy, the choice of entertainment, and the  longer flight to Heathrow rather than  trying to fly  over the Gulf and return. Otherwise, the epitaph ""how the mighty have fallen"" springs to mind."
3.0,"London Heathrow - Pisa return. I fly this route often as I have a house in Tuscany. I  fly British Airways Club Europe only because the FAs are better, the lounge is a welcome benefit - and if you book far ahead enough - you can get a reasonable deal plus Avious points. That  said there is little benefits to flying say Ryanair. The trip started at T5 and the Northern lounge was not, for a change, to busy. Had a fruit and coffee breakfast. The options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps - dripping fat all over the place. Some years ago - BA provided some nice scrambled eggs. Now they don't. Flight left from the ""A"" terminal and we boarded ""downstairs"" from the lounge. The plane was half full. It was clean and valeted. We pushed back 10 minutes early. My wife  ordered a sort of brunch thing, cheese and ham + rolls. She said it was ok. I had a couple of Gin and Tonics. The FA said she had never  seen such an empty flight - and neither had I for that . The now chargeable food and beverages in Economy went down like a lead balloon apparently. I read  a BA ""Brochure"" on the now chargeable food and  beverages a Sales and Marketing professional - It was the most patronising piece of rubbish I'd ever read. It read as if BA were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all. And goodness me - the products are not cheap - over a £1 for  a kit kat. We landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like Ryanair customers. Several years ago you had the air-bridge.  Now you don't. The return flight started in the shared lounge which  got rammed. This in part is due to Qatar airlines operating out of Pisa and their Business Class customers use the same facility. Some booze and snacks - nothing edible.  Return delayed by  10 minutes. Plane was rammed. Very pleasant FAs. Afternoon tea - with horrible dried out sandwiches + scones that didn't look like scones. On both flights - the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table. No legroom. Hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as £600 return. Docked at the ""B"" terminal and had to walk miles to the trains - that took us back to T5/Terminal ""A"". All in all - another disappointing  departure from the ""World's most frugal Airline""."
7.0,"Our flight from St Lucia to  Dubai Efficient check  in Lounge at  St Lucia was  not dire, some  food provided which  is ok. Plane  on time. Club  has middle seats which were a  good option for  me The food  choices on this  flight were not  of the usual  and I would  out of business ! The starter  with melon and  rice was poor.  My chicken main , overcooked and  without any flavor.  Others were good.  Fruit options missing  or not loaded  food quality generally  The FA's were  on the main , but some  more than others.  Plane was well  looked after. However,  every FA attending , my wife  had experience and  that showed. Overall a good flight. On the subject  with baggage, it  would seem that  those of us  had priority tagged  luggage received their  baggage quickly (mine  was almost last!)."
10.0,"Old Town to  Newark Heathrow in  an old but  nicely kept Boeing  777 Full flight.  Both left and  returned on time. What made this  service so outstanding  was the crew.  Always attentive and  helpful My broken headphone was replaced  within seconds of me telling one of the crew, when my wife's  music selection was  initially not available it was rapidly  replaced at a  different section and  replaced - to  my pleasant surprise.  *"
1.0,Currently am due  to fly from  London to Vancouver  at London Heathrow. I pre-paid for  the seat and their system assigned a wrong seat. I called customer  services 6 times  but no one helped me the  got this fixed.  UK Airways customer service is the  worst airline customer service I've seen. I would be  willing to pay  the next time  I to travel  with British Airways.
4.0,"Malta to Gatwick. My friend arrived at the check in desk (it was a long queue as the  WiFi was down),  to be told that she had just checked baggage in one way.  We had paid on the way out and the check in online app did not  mean she had to pay twice for the trip.  Same for the food menu? The food is so expensive and it's  impossible to get a meal deal from airport shops that pay these prices. An airline  does not represent a country when  judged based on profit above it's people. At least Ryanair etc are  small and cheap!  UK Airways is such a sad reflection on the country as a whole !
"
2.0,Back to Larnaca. Sadly British Airways  is now a  really poor quality  British airline that  now thinks it 's a top  tier carrier. The  flights are generally  quite shabby and  outdated The staff  are surly and  make the seating cramped and uncomfortable. I am a  well travelled and  much prefer to  join Club Europe . I am  not paying three  times the price  of the same  flight as economy. It is a joke - if  a person in  me reclines I can't work -  and how is this in any  real business class.
4.0,"Back to Seattle  to London Heathrow.  Really don't know . I chose  to fly BA  with a sense  for nostalgia I  have Going to  Seattle this time,  we decided to  travel east, via  BA and BA  has a good  chance I will  always do so ! I specifically  arranged all the  booking through BA so as to avoid any issues  or transitions between  flights e.g. having  to pick up  baggage en route.  The non BA flights were arranged  and discovered subsequently) with non-partnered airlines,  with no instructions  for PNR's -  having to find out what the  flight was in order to get  the boarding pass  - an adventure  - BA checkin  desk kept referring me to the  next leg of  the flight. ""We  can give you  your boarding pass - its not  yet BA partnered ."" - ""But BA did all  the booking!"". Blank look and total  no ""Try in Heathrow"". I eventually  did and got  a PNR and  checked myself in  without a boarding . Similarly on  my way back,  I was no instruction to the  fact that BA  told me to  bring my bags  from Mumbai before  going on the  next flight. When  i got to the gate, the  gate staff pulled  up to the  side and castigated  myself for not  checking my bags.  Any fact that  nobody told me  not do so  seemed to be  blamed on them.  So despite BA being the travel  authority here, it  appears to be  for the customers  seem to know what to do.  My flights out  were not too  terrible - fairly  standard business class,  and staff were  quite attentive, aside  from the fact , they never  acknowledged my first meal choice. On  my way back  - forget it.  Sorry - no overhead luggage space because it was  filled with BA  flights - it  was the 'for  general use only'  in the front  so it was  number 11! When  I asked them  about shift that,  I was met  by resentful suggestions  that I could  find space elsewhere  in the plane.  This was pretty  angry but polite  made the point  that having paid  in business class,  they did not  expect to have to go searching  out space because  we had gear  under my seat  - and that  i wanted them to shift their  seat and provide  me convenient overhead  luggage space. Done with bad grace. They then essentially  grounded me for  every rest of  my flight -  my overnight request for a cup  or tea (I  had dinner to sleep) took 20  minutes The breakfast was truly awful  and one of  the worst airline meals I have  EVER had. The seats are tight  and I endorse all the concerns  regarding the 2-4-2 , I'm 6  ft 5, but <mask> myself fit <mask> I'm not fat. I have <mask> around the <mask> in multiple <mask> seats and <mask> BA version <mask> honestly the <mask> and most <mask> Yes, its <mask> - but <mask> short, and <mask> and lumpy! <mask> Ethihad, Emirates, <mask> EVA, Thai, <mask> Pacific - <mask> do much <mask> than this <mask> even Delta <mask> American Airlines <mask> are much <mask> Generally, the BA experience is <mask> uncomfortable and <mask> I'm embarrassed <mask> have my <mask> nation offer <mask> mediocre services.

9.0," I have flown  my lot with  US Airways and other airlines and am constantly amazed  at BA's bad reviews. Flew from Chicago to London.  This plane was  extremely comfortable and well presented. The staff were impeccable, polite and helpful - in my view some of  the best. The only thing I 'd ask is that they review  the food. They  should certainly cut  the costs in particular for breakfast  upon landing and that was insubstantial.  And they continue to impress."
1.0,"Return to London Heathrow. Due to  some problem with our ticket which where first class  flights to Heathrow, which I may add both my wife and I checked twice when booking the tickets was dated 12th  March instead of 12th February. We checked in or tried to check  in whereupon the discrepancy was brought to our attention. We couldn't prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we  simply had to get home. The staff tried in  advance to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, ""no nothing could be done"". We enquired the cost of two Economy seats home whereupon we told the two Economy tickets would come to an eye-watering $5092 or £4243 Economy. To add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be re-booked to the 12th February, no chance. We had no choice  in a barrel) scarcity value I  heard you cry, no. We boarded to find that the flight was less than half full. My wife and I were beside ourselves with anger (not to the flight crew) it wasn't their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves.  to cap it all the food on the way  out was appalling inedible. We will  NEVER fly BA again. British Airways - the worlds biggest rip off. "
10.0,"London Heathrow to  London O'Hare and my experience was  good There were a few problems checking in at Terminal 5 (there was an issue with some of  our luggage belts at check-in running slow - never mind these things happen). We were given information about what was happening  and staff were doing their best. Fast-track security was fast. Made my way to the lounge in South Terminal which was busy but I was able to find a quiet spot. Lots of food and drinks on offer but I stuck to water as I knew would be eating on the plane. Had to  talk to a  friend in B  terminal - this  is my first time at Terminal 5 so asked  how to get to the gate,  had easy instructions given and transportation via the transit  area Boarding was  fine although I didn't use the priority boarding service  ( bad missing the announcement). I  spent extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper  level and really glad I did. Our cabin crew were wonderful, so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them. The food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice! I managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me. There's lots of room and the  upper deck is limited to a  minimum of 20 passengers so it feels very private. The window seats  have lots of  room but unless you are in 62 or 64 A/K you have to climb over your neighbour's foot stool/legs to get in and out of your seat. 63J is an aisle seat so less private but  lots of room as it's by an exit door (ideal for anybody over 6ft). There  was a long not too high  partition to place items (I put  one pair of  thick leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more) and there's the overhead lockers. I couldn't fault my trip out and I am hoping my  upcoming trip is just as enjoyable."
2.0,"London Heathrow to Mumbai. I've been a loyal BA customer for several years, but this was a journey of disappointment. I was late to the airport due to delays on the train line. Called customer services while on my way, and after 15min of wait I was told they couldn't do anything about it, but gave me the number of the airport. It  was incorrect. At Terminal 5 I asked the attendant for help given the rush. He was quite rude and said I had to join the queue unless I was flying business. At the gate, we had a late boarding because 'the computer wasn't working'. I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlines.  Plus  my 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment. My headrest was hanging down the seat, the screen was filthy and  one arm broken so it wouldn't stay in position. The flight attendant (who I never saw smiling for  my entire flight)  said he had  broken it on the way in. I asked to change my seat. In my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops (it wasn't the headphones, I tried mine too).  The entertainment system was poor. It started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing, plus the 'noise cancelling' headphones are NOT noise cancelling - try pulling the jack out and it doesn't make a difference. Overall a very poor experience, crowned by a terrible breakfast. Sorry BA but you are stuck in the 80s and you're slipping further down my list of preferences.

2.0,"San Jose Costa Rica to London Gatwick. We were firstly unable to get two seats together at online check-in. The next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together  but he refused. I argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights.  After about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together. I later found out the two BA employees, travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually, after a great  bit of argument moved. I have complained to BA and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn't in the future. Next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight. My IFE didnt work, they offered to move me, ironically to swap with one of  our BA employees but I declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife. Choice of starter  seats not available but that was no big deal. Dreadful, stressful experience for people who'd paid a lot of money. Have been called by Customer Service who  have offered us  two Avios as compensation, enough for a night at the Holiday Inn Express! Awful company  t deal with, totally dismissive of customer need. On the plus side Business Class seats were comfortable and cabin crew attentive.  Airlines need to do better though, far better if they are to compete with the good Middle East and Far Eastern airlines."
4.0,"Amman to London Heathrow. Staff were very minimalistic in their service. They were not rude,  were not willing , be helpful  and go out of their way  or make a good impression. . . fly very often, not often with BA so thought I'd try it, and now realized they do  indeed compare with  most major airlines."
6.0,"On Heathrow to  Manchester I paid  no extra for  my exit seat  - this is  THE best thing  I do. Make  sure you get  to one closest  to window, mainly  so no-one stands  around to stretch  there legs etc.  I get unlimited  elbow room and  then ability to  sit up and  stretch / stretch  however you want,  so it is  great value on  a ten hour  flight The seats  on the A380 are narrow, the  ventilation system the  best etc. The  meals were fine.  My major issue  that British Airways , is their  pocket pinching. You  get down, there  are no welcome  mats - you  can have your  meal and   ten hours later  when you are  there you have  to pay for  their snacks. It's  worse On American , they put  up boxes of  diet biscuits etc which you can 't help yourself ! If you  want a diet  Coke on American  they get a  regular 330ml can,  with British Airways  I get the  smaller version. There  are so few  passengers flying in  / between different  of these things  and BA has  some other major  airlines so sadly,  who use them?"
2.0,"Lisbon to London . Now that  they have started  charge for all  meals and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. Over the  last few years, leg room across European flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to  this point where  is now practically the same as  a budget airline. That said, it 's in practice  worse than budget airlines, because at  present the main  budget carriers have  taken the decent  job of removing  their seat recline button, eliminating further discomfort. Even without  their seat in front reclined, anyone  taller than 5' 8"" will be packed in tightly on any European  Airlines flight. The  staff are friendly and polite. However, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours ! This does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers, but also the almost permanent presence of  food service trolleys  along the aisle blocking access to the toilets. Business  class (which I  do use) is offered a free meal and drinks,  usually of a  good quality. However,  on terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared  to economy. The only reason I continue to fly  business is because I have fairly set routes and BA generally fly at times which  interest me. Otherwise, I get little in the way of added value. The benefits of  extra points and moving up membership tiers are hardly  worth it (in monetary terms), particularly if one mostly flies within Europe. It is much cheaper to get a lounge membership (many are valid  for most European - and beyond - airports), rather than remain loyal to BA these days. I have been flying with BA for well over a decade  now on a monthly basis. My sympathies go to  the staff, because I fear cost-cutting will get them next, which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews  hold to this  airline"
7.0,"Flying Tegel to London Heathrow. I decided to give  Brit Airways a chance for a short weekend trip  to London, because when it comes to prices they  really beat the  big airlines. And  why do you ? I had a part of  a low-cost experience  with a bigger price: no checked-in luggage included (not even as a  side Emerald) and you had to  pay for your inflight snacks and  drinks A plus  was that the  prices for the snacks and drinks were not as  expensive as with  the airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good. The prices were even below  American ones. The bad thing was , that they  took a lot  more time to  stock all the products (people were buying stuff) and it took ages until you could  complete your order - well, you can't compete with Ryanair trying to do better the  thing they do best. I really miss the days when British Airways was offering tea nad coffee for  tea and a little snack, it was a pleasure to fly with them and I  will be happy to get back  on those days. Some good things about the flights was that they  announced ahead of  time boarding was very efficient, which  was a big plus and the  seats were gorgeous, a lot of space, very comfortable leather seats. As an advice, please don't try to be someone else,  look where British Airways used to be and the success will come. Losing an identity  will cause more financial damage then a sandwich and a tea offered for free."
3.0,"Istanbul to London : I am  an frequent flyer  from Turkey and  yesterday I got  first time flight  on British Airways.  I feel it  is the worst  experience so far  compare to others.  Do you imagine  that they even  do not give  a cup of  coffee to the  passenger for 3.5-hour  journey from Istanbul  - London.   They explained it  is economical concerns.  Why is the  only benefit not  to serve a  glass of water?  Even from London , Vancouver, we  delayed almost 2  hour because of luggage issues and  the passenger did nt feel well  and he had  already leave the  plane which could  easily understandable this ! But, the  flight was old  747 747, the  seats were very  high quality and … The name  of the company  are big but  cost of the  staff is far  less than average.  Cabin crew are  good though, so  that is not  any mistake. It  was enough trouble  to me not  even select BA  for my flights  in the future."
1.0,"Very dirty, tired , 777-200 to Chicago. British Airways First Class seat  is barely a Business Class seat on other airlines. Food absolutely terrible,  the service from crew hurried and disinterested. IFE movies  no selection, and slow. This is  another airline in decline. They don't care because of limited competition across the Atlantic. In summary, not First Class, but rather no class. Finally, their First Class lounge at Heathrow was dirty and  empty"
1.0,"from Heathrow to  London As you  walk into Heathrow T5 you have  that feeling of a world class  plane - and that's where it  takes 20 minutes  early for boarding  and only after  I had got  us on the  ground did they  be sorry we  got technical problems  and passenger didnt  pick up - it took them  1 hour to  clear the plane didn't tell us  about the problem  was and remove  our passengers bags!  I gave up  the seat 38D  to a lady  had to sit  with her friends  so I got  up - big mistake! Seat does  not recline and the headrest extender  is broken and  was slipping down.  On takeoff the aircon above decided  and was going to start leaking  from above -  and the guy  was in seat  38 the staff smiled said she  would see what  we can do  I went to the galley behind  us and I  heard her say  to a co-worker  was the last  on her problems.  That was the  worst plane I 've been on  there was people  on the plane wearing winter jackets  - was that ? I took  a blanket put it over my head and wrapped  it behind my  neck and pulled  it down with  my feet. Toilet  behind me was  blood sucking the  whole flight. They had to manually  disconnect everyone's screens,  which were very  slow the fact  a mobile has a bigger screen  leaving a lot  to be desired. Not to mention  anything you tried to watch would  be continual lag.  The interior on  the seating was  cold and lumpy  and sitting here  reading this 8  months later and  the backside is  so raw! They  didnt even have  wifi to charge  my phone!   Although they encourage  you to use their mobile app  or digital boarding  passes to make  things more seamless  they fail to put any USB  connection points around  this plane. Going  on email BA  and ask for a refund on  a return ticket . I can  safely say out  of the 20  or so airlines  we have flown  with over the years this is  by far the  biggest "
8.0,Gatwick to Cape Town. This journey  provided a very pleasant surprise. I didn't expect great service and was not disappointed. I  DID expect great  beer or wine and was not  pleased I didn't  expect a comfortable  aisle seat and was pleasantly surprised. This was an  older 777 with a 3-3-3 configuration  (= seat pitch) in economy and comfortable seats. I flew to South Africa this time last year with  Boeing on their new B787 and it was a nightmare. The comfort of seat on  a long haul  was far more important to me  that anything else  but this was  a far more pleasant experience than  I had expected.
7.0,"Toronto to London  - premium economy. Easy check in and fast track  queue meant I  was in the  lounge within 15 mins. Unfortunately, they were clearing up  the restocking from  an earlier flight.  Good choice of  cheap sandwiches and  coffee on it's last legs. I  told the front  staff know, and the staff made  me a fresh sandwich. Also, beers  were changed with  English lagers and Newcastle Brown. The Manager fetched some IPA from the  Club lounge - some really good customer service which  is typical in  that lounge. The  usual disorganised boarding , with few  juices Onboard, juice or water offered. I asked for  a wine but  was only done  for flights from  Canada - (crew  said it can't  be chilled at  all - (poor  choice given they do it for Club and First). Fast service after  check off with  a ok entree.  A salad, and a nasty dry piece of cake.  It was the  same as my trip over Christmas  and it seems  the IFE is  offered less often. Tea, coffee and  tea offered before , But no  sandwich or even a biscuit -  really poor. Prompt  arrival and bags beat me to the baggage belt.  In a week  ago was a better flight. Easy  checking in again and no fast  track queue. North  Delta was an  average experience, ok  choices of sandwiches  but not particularly  good and in  less of a  meal Bused to  have a Boeing 787-9, with premium  Economy only half ! A half  bottle of prosecco  not offered and a requested top up was forgotten.  Good bar service by excellent cabin  crew who offered good customer service.  Another ok meal  included a rancid  but ok steak and a tiny  slice of desert. Generous with the  staff Unfortunately, the  lack of afternoon tea at the  airport is inexplicable and really poor  service by BA.  It was offered  once plus a  salad bar or malt loaf finger. The crew were genuinely embarrassed (a  selection of sandwiches  they liberated from the club lounge made up for ) Fast off  of plane, and  a slow immigration,  the bags beat me again. Overall  the flight was  good but certainly not up to the standard of  first economy on  board The meal is nowhere near  that standard and its the cutting  of the small  items - nibbles, breakfast and afternoon  tea which irk  me the most.  Not competitive but  please take it out on me! I wouldn't mind but the prices  should go down with the reduction of service. Despite what the CEO maintains - it 's not in  proportion to customer feedback. BA need to listen to what we're saying and take a  look hard look <mask> their conscious <mask> to downgrade <mask> and become as bad as the budget airlines. Eventually the hardiest <mask> us loyal <mask> customers will <mask> up and <mask> airline / alliance and that would be a shame."
1.0,"London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Fly in  comfort and style  was the slogan  of British Airways,  unfortunately there is  hardly much of either around these  days Not willing to pay an  expensive £8, I was allocated a  comfortable seat right at the rear. At the gate  another announcement was  given for volunteers  to check in their hand-luggage ""at  no extra cost"".  After a minute a burly employee told me I  was to check  out my cabin , saying ""you should not believe  whatever is said on the company's  website How very  sad Some ten  other passengers, equally  overweight suffered the  same fate. I  know there were  ten because another  passenger kept counting us and saying ""we need ten"".  This burly employee  was later to  be found on the airbridge to make sure that  I really did hand over our cabin bags. All  in all a  positive experience. The  lower rows are now more tightly packed than before.  Although of average slim build, I  found the seat a tight fit. Only a few  passengers took up the offer to purchase food or  beverages (the deceptive  product we were sold at the beginning of the  flight But still, did not reach the back of  our plane until  just before landing. Not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared,  we also newspapers  and priority boarding  from those of us who are  frequent flyers. On  the return journey I noticed part  if the reason  is this new , the Stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced  with agency staff. BA is now  no better than the no frills , but keeps  a facade of  being full service  airline with full service prices. A  loyal customer of many, many years, I will choose their competitors in future."
8.0,"London Heathrow to  New Vegas, and a great journey.  The flight was on time and  people were professional  & friendly. The inflight meals were tasty and the  cabin of a good size. Although the seats are  little bit narrow, they were comfortable and the leg  space was adequate. Facilities on the plane were clean. Would definitely fly  here again."
5.0,"London Heathrow to Rome return. Race to the bottom. My first time with the new buy onboard service. I was not  happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment. Basically it does not work. I can  see in some  detail why they decided to offer a wide range of food options. I would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks. Even soft drinks are chargeable - I don't think this is acceptable. However, despite the extensive menu, there was an extremely limited selection available. One crew member came round soon after the flight took off and  made orders for hot food. There 's a 20-25  minute wait time for this. The crew then came around with the  drink trolley. This was extremely slow. The payments could only be made with credit cards or Avios points.  This payment added significant times to process. Despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin, we didn't get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started. There was only the one trolley, and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent. CEO Alex Cruz and British Airways - your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom - more rows in economy, 10 abreast in some 777's and other cost cutting measures mean that even though I'm a Silver Exec club member I am now considering my  own travel options. I live near Manchester Airport and KLM/Air France and Lufthansa are more attractive options."
2.0,"London to London  – Despite having  one confirmed booking,  after I attempted  a check-in with  the prepaid-for bag  at 1535 at  London EDI airport  for a 1655  departure to LCY (domestic flight) I  got told I couldn’t as the flight had been  delayed I accepted  their offer to switch to a later flight on the same route  with Flybe and  claim compensation but then was told  the compensation couldn’t be authorised so  someone had to  wait I then  waited around for 10 minutes, being asked to ‘move  off of the  gate at one point because I was blocking others.  I was not  handed a copy of the compensation scheme details (despite what the BA website claims should  have done) and  BA staff seemed unclear of it  so I was  then ignored until  they approached the desk again and insisted to speak  to a supervisor.  None was available  but could be  booked apparently. I wasn’t allowed to  change to the Flybe flight “in  as a seat  was available on my original flight,  so they tagged my luggage but  would not check it in. I was told to  sit for another  15 minutes. I  suppose this was  only fair to  let me in  anyway given I had a confirmed booking in the  second place but I was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and  therefore not their  fault that other  people had checked-in before me. I  got treated as a nuisance. At  that point, there  were 5 members  of BA check in staff doing  this (nobody else to serve) whilst I was just standing silently there  waiting and being . After 20 minutes of not knowing what to  expect my original  door closed and  I was approached  with a supervisor (who suddenly was available to talk to me) and given a seat.  When asked how it was that  the seat has magically appeared if  previously I had been told the  flight was already  booked with no  seat available. He  replied that the  seat had been  prepaid for by  someone who had then not checked  in and as  their check-in was closing, they could  show me the  seat now. I  told him that  i resented having been treated rudely by his staff  again (though the  man himself was professional and courteous)  but that his staff are untrained  and deal with  me I had done nothing wrong  and deserve being  treated so shabbily,  as a problem rather than a  solution I then  made a predictably  long rush through security to ensure  it was not  refused boarding at the gate for being late (even  if I had  arrived at the  gate with plenty of time to  spare originally, especially <mask> a domestic <mask> As I told the supervisor, <mask> the airline treats its customers with such contempt, do not be <mask> that the <mask> ends up <mask> the airline <mask> contempt. Under <mask> current policy <mask> overbooking, passengers who do not pay more to <mask> a seat <mask> advance are <mask> risk of not getting a seat at all, even though they have a confirmed booking. Some would <mask> this cheating. <mask> saving grace <mask> the experience was that the flight was punctual, and unlike mainline BA, this route is run by its subsidiary BA CityFlyer which still <mask> complimentary drinks and a snack <mask> which the <mask> crew service was efficient. I rate it 2 <mask> of 10 <mask> the stress <mask> in checking <mask>"
4.0,"London to London Heathrow on BA is a 6 hr 50 min overnight flight. Sleeping on overnight flights in economy class  is an ordeal in itself, bit I was highly disappointed that more than an hour before landing - we had just  entered French airspace - all cabin  meals were put on bright for the breakfast/snack service (following the dinner  before take-of in  all the more ) this service consisted of a cup of tea or coffee (or cold drink) only.  And even a  meal was offered.  I was shocked."
4.0,"So a tale  of two airlines  and their individual  approach to Business  class passengers. We  are flying to Mauritius on holiday , I felt, given the flying , we should  prepare ourselves and  ourselves up-front with  having the 'comparative'  cost of Business Class. The British Airways flight itself was okay, the  staff friendly and  spacious cabin worked . However, I  was totally shocked  by the standards  and catering in the Gatwick Lounge  (* small issue for some perhaps,  not for me, it's all part  for the Business Class experience). To  make my point,  please attach a  picture of what  a policy of  putting shareholders first  really means for  your passengers. With  a very confusing layout that greets one in the  International Terminal now  ( BA have  come in, the  ' yourself' check-in  and even label your own bags!). I was pretty  shocked by the  point we actually  reached the 'Lounge'. But then to  being greeted with  that was totally  unacceptable So, Willie,  other than screwing  with costs for the benefit of your shareholders, this  sort of display  of overt cost-cutting  has now lost  you revenue for  your future. Short-sighted ness or what?  With a lesson from Emirates who  we decided to  go home with,  and disgusted was I over our  experience They put passengers first!"
7.0,"London Heathrow to  the return.Both flights  are punctual but sadly the 747-400 aircraft used are  really beginning to look their 20  plus years of age, especially compared  to the A380s  we have used on this route.  The cabin is looking rather tired  and worn and  my seats are  not comfortable enough for a 9 hour flight. I was very pleased  I have booked  an exit row  ticket for additional  seating The IFE system is also quite dated and  outdated compared to modern offerings. On  the plus side the cabin staff were friendly, helpful  and courteous and  that is somewhere  we seem to do well. Food  & drink were complimentary and of  good quality for economy class. Boarding at YVR was  very well organised, less so at the Heathrow end. It is also  the shame that  most flights depart from the cramped  Terminal 3 at Heathrow. Overall a reasonable experience, but  hope that they  could improve to excellent with a bit more polish."
10.0,"Return trip from Washington Dulles to London Heathrow. Flight was barely a quarter full. Going to Washington flight was probably only about a third full. Attendants said  this was the quietest they had  ever seen. Given that I was  on an A380 it really did look empty. Food and service was good both ways and the aircraft was only a couple of years old. Plenty of  seating on the  main cabin and  some overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner  had flown on.  I was given an exit row seat which was very welcome. BA usually charge £58 for this seat. It meant about 5 foot of legroom and because  our next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the  return flight meaning the area was very quiet. No real gripes although the ""snack"" served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from  a small meal to a tiny Twix chocolate and a cup of coffee. Flight cost £430 and using some airmiles I knocked this down to £330. Loads  more interactive channels to watch but films weren't the  priority but that's a personal thing."
1.0,"Flying to London with British Airways.  Not a frequent  traveler For a change, we decided  and fly BA  from London from Thailand for our 12 hour journey.  When we were  boarding we realized  how the seat  noise was coming ! Underneath there  are lots of . We then  thought that we  cannot watch movies , due to  noise that there was no sound.  We informed the  BA crew and  they said that  we will report  to relevant people etc. Our other  issue was the  seat - it had no taste , and was  made with plastic , which broke few times. In  general I would not recommend flying  by BA."
7.0,"London to Hong i with British Airways. The flight is good as I booked the  first business seat and it is  better if flying  in to get  your best seat 16K, other seats are below standard  in long haul business. Yet a similar seat on an A380 is better. Service is  excellent and food  is adequate. I  fly this route many times on  BA rather than . CX is better but BA  better priced, and that is, if you get the  cheapest seat. 7 points for B777 and 8 for A380."
8.0,"Using British Airways from Paris to  London is less  complicated as they are the only major airline that has the check in counter located one floor down  the basement, but  note that on  this occasion the business class lounge is relocated to the Cathay Pacific  lounge as this  allows for long  haul passengers. Boarding  on time but  arrival in tarmac  takes half an  hours not BA's '. The pilot tried to make  up time but  has failed by a few minutes  to have lost  their allotted time, so the aircraft  landed a mile away with inconvenient  direct deplane and coach connection, but  not that business  passengers are taken  home first in  a separate car.  Every flight is  packed with snack  or drink."
1.0,"Return to London Heathrow. Don't waste  your money buying BA seat assignments  into advance! I  experienced that a  month ago, at  the same time  that I made  a booking, and  opted for an aisle seat of  your choice. When I went back  a week before  my journey, my  preferred seat was  available and I was placed in  the undesirable middle seat. There was no remedy for  it Five calls  within three days . BA connected  up to people  around Delhi whose  English vocabulary was  very sorry, and  said no. I 've been deceived,  lied to, and  told off. I have flown British many times; this  was absolutely my last time. It  is acceptable to  make an error,  yet totally unacceptable  you callously make  an effort at  least to rectify  it Take my  choice choose another ! I am  an OneWorld emerald flyer on AA,  with 200k miles  per year, and  you can tell  that service from  a British Airways  has unfortunately declined ."
3.0,"The quality of British Airways has most certainly gone downhill. On short  journeys from London Heathrow to Rome it is nothing more than that  for easyjet. Online check in was quick and easy, and terminal 5 is a delight however online check in is only available 24 hours  after departure unlike  Emirates which allows for check in 30 days prior to departure. That was the only  pleasant part of our journey. We boarded a packed  BA 767 which was decaying with the middle seat  getting so narrow  is was impossible to get in  / out of  our seat in  between (We were in row 13). Without notice, we had to go  through de-icing which meant a 45min  difference to our service (we did however catch up 35mins). Our inbound  flight was on  the newer A319  and had better seats and a  longer Due to slot restrictions at Rome and London, this flight was  often delayed. During  both flights the new buy on board was poorly done, taking forever  including a limited range of overpriced products. I therefore  could only conclude that the airline , once one just 10 months ago offering meals  for short haul  trips as well  as always being  on time is now nothing more  than a low cost carrier with  cramped planes and a useless service.  Such a shame."
9.0,"London Heathrow to Brussels. Living in  Brussels for 6  years I décided  I go back home for a week. I am terrifying about flying but choose to do it by plane anyway. I am happy to have chosen BA, in the airport, at the gate, in the plane, I felt safe and people listen to me. I had the chance the two times (going and back) to meet the captain in the cockpit to feel better. The crew was nice and friendly and thanks to them I had a comfortable flight and I 'm now ready to Take it again. The planes were clean and nice"
3.0,"My partner and I flew Dublin to Seattle via  London Heathrow with  Qatar Airways. Heathrow  in Seattle was  on a B777-200  that was slightly  overweight and seats  are rather cramped,  making it impossible  for sleep on  a 9-10hr flight.  Passenger check-in wasn't possible and we  only able to select our seats  on our booking  using an Iberia  Airways number even  though it was  rejected by BA.  Three lengthy phone calls and same response was given  - nothing could be done about it until the  end Arrived early at airport to  the plane was overbooked so my  friend and I  can get our seats together - ground staff could  say nothing about ! Luckily we were able to  swap with another passenger once on . Food was bland to say  the least -  possibly the worse  of any carrier  had ever flown ! However, service provided by cabin crew was excellent. Would only fly  there again for  lunch"
2.0,"This whole experience  felt poor flying from London Heathrow to Athens. Ancient aircraft (767), poor  onboard entertainment and the new food offering in which you purchase your food was very  basic and lacking some of the  already limited range of products. On short haul, and  BA at 4 pm is classified as this, BA  are now a low cost carrier without the efficiency  of the more established low cost carriers. The sole advantage is that they fly to/from  major airports. This  company is trading on past reputation and it can only be a matter of time  till a largely  loyal customer base  leaves them for alternative airlines."
3.0,"Return to London : Having flown  from Doha with  British Airways, the  flight with British  Airlines was a  disappointment For a  flight the Club 's seats are  not comfortable. There 's hardly anywhere  you stow bits  or pieces. The  airline crew were : We departed  Qatar approximately 9am.  Shortly on reaching  cruising altitude, we  was informed that they were now  offering ""lunch"". At  breakfast We were  informed that we  would be given  sandwiches on descent,  this on a  5 hour flight.  Any cynical person  would think that  the crew wanted  the get meal  planning out of  their way early.  I don't know  which timezone ""lunch""  was in, possibly  London but certainly  not Doha or  London time. After  three hours I  ring the bell.  One female cabin  staff person came and asked incredulously, did you ring  that bell""? Yes,  but the entire  time I asked  about the sandwich and she told  us that I  would have to  ask No, I  want it now.  After a five  dollar meal, a  sandwich Having just  flown on Qatar  Airlines where the  meal menu is  de la carte  and you can  buy anything at  meal time, apparently  this pre-prepared sandwich  made a big  hit In business , I was  also pointedly ignored  throughout the rest  of the flight. I did complain  once to BA , to their  credit I received  no response -  apparently they were  sorry I felt  the way. Never  again Pay a  penny for this  poor service."
1.0,"Will never touch  British Airways again.  I flown BA on this route from Orlando to  Birmingham Heathrow for a long time  and services have seriosuly gone downhill.  As I went  to the back  on the plane to ask for  my snack I  got told I had to buy them. Having paid  over £1000 for my tickets I replied I'm not  satisfied that I've  got enough for  my flight already.  to which the  general manager replied 'well thats just  the way the  world is going, people want value  on money and  this is how  you get it,  all the airlines  is doing it,  unless you don't like it tough'. I have never  felt spoken to so rudely by  another member of staff in my life! As well  as this the  tickets were old  but the screens  didnt work. Other  airlines namely Air New Zealand, Singapore , even American,  in my opinion  all represent a lot better value  for money, you even still get  seats on long haul flights! (I  mean all the  others are doing  it right?).

3.0,"* Bradford to Heathrow. Service is  comparable to Ryanair and EasyJet. I've  tried flying with  them regularly for  around 4 years  and I can't get my head  round what is  going on. Complimentary drinks replaced with  no Buy on Board menu and the flight is  SO short not  many passengers even get served now!  - Really just ! There is  great competition on  an LBA route,  but I certainly  will pay anything  less to travel with BA from now on if  they are alternatives available - Ryanair  service is at around a fifth  of the price usually!"

He did  and I received  a conformation and  told that the  flight was scheduled for 1/31/17. I  called him and  just said ""Oh , that was an error on our part"". However,  the book this  and gave up my other seat.  He told him  that was his mistake and he  promised to fix . He said  the only thing  they could do was give me  the partial refund  but would be  great as it  was $2k to  find a new  one or I  could fly out  for 1/4/17. I  asked if British  Airlines would comp  the hotel for  his mistake. He  said no and  I asked how  BA expected me  could pay for  the hotel for  3 more nights.  I had no  answer He refused  to book me  on any other  hotel I asked  for a manager  and said there  are none available.  He fought with  them from 5pm until 1am (no exaggeration, I have  some of the  phone calls). I decided to get  dressed at 6am,  walk to the  hotel and talk  with a BA  representative - only  the find out  we have no BA reps but  one rep representing a BA rep. She told me  that first she 'd do nothing  - and I  informed her I did not care  where in the  world she got  - just get  on to the US. She managed to get me a flight to  Frankfurt the next . She comp'd  the hotel for  the night and  the meals. As a business who  really inconvenienced me ! However, she  proceeded to tell me that my  bags were not connected and I  needed to individually check in to  get one. The  gate associate also failed to do  this Therefore, when  my stewardess for  me was 30 mins late and  had us delayed quite a bit,  I had to  go to the next gate only to find out  she wasn't checked  in so they  lost my seat  - I begged  and pleaded (and !) and they somehow by the  power of a  human being found  my seat. Upon  walking into the  plane I was so grateful, until  we found out  the bag was  not in Dusseldorf. It took another 2 weeks to  bring it back. At the end  with it, BA  had me in  over $400 deficit !!! to get <mask> to CA <mask> Philly) . <mask> contacted customer <mask> to complain <mask> it took <mask> a month <mask> hear back <mask> all they <mask> to say <mask> that they <mask> do anything <mask> me. Next <mask> I will <mask> however much <mask> it costs <mask> fly with <mask> airline who <mask> some form <mask> management overseeing their employees and <mask> know will <mask> screw me <mask> Lufthansa, for example, treated me <mask> well and I wasn't even <mask> paying customer."
2.0,"Flying Heathrow to Innsbruck. I have been a loyal customer of British Airways for 30 years. If ever I had a choice between them and another airline I chose British Airways, but no more. The new food and drink service is appalling. The crew on our flight never  make it to the last 8 or so rows, so my children (sat at the back) went thirsty. This was particularly poor as another child had wandered  towards the back of the plane and vomited copiously  afterwards - clearly  it is not BA's fault, but  certainly is their fault that I couldn't then get a drink for my children to take their minds off the stench of puke pervading our part of  a plane. Next time I will fly Ryanair. I doubt we'll notice any difference."
1.0,"Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Starting with being charged $180 to check  and hold luggage,  everyone on the  other sectors being  charged to check  in hold luggage  absolutely free. The onboard service continues to decline for passengers in BA World Traveller - terrible food, minimal  service and raised eye brows if you ask for a second glass of wine. You get the feeling that if you so much as ask for anything other than the bare minimum you will be restrained and arrested on  landing at your  gate Seat was okay,  better  service than American Airlines I have  to say but the movie selection and TV selection was poor as usual with random selections of TV programmes which are interrupted continually by  flight announcements. The new BA CEO is doing a great job of turning a once great airline into  another low cost subsidiary Vueling."
1.0,"Gatwick to Barcelona.  Flying with the new M&S on eworld service. Boarding  is badly organised  because the cabin , cabin bags  only a few)  sat in the  luggage compartment and  then took ages  for all the  passengers to place  their bags overhead.  Also had to  put my bag  from behind my . It's not  easy to fly  with them anymore  because their service , just like  other airlines, but  luckily I booked  the tickets before  their announcement of  flights onboard."
3.0,"From Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro.  45 minute delay on the tarmac. Air conditioning wasn't  on during delay  - would only  start once engines were on. The cabin was therefore  incredibly hot. The foam in my  Boeing 30B had  deteriorated to the  extent I could  see the metal  plate underneath digging  into my tail . I informed  BA cabin staff  about this - but due to  the flight being overbooked, I couldn't  get moved and  instead I was given an extra  charge This is  a 12 hour  flight and I  dont think this  not acceptable. I was very uncomfortable during this flight.  In flight entertainment  is pausing and pixelating/blipping. In flight  charges now have to be paid . Considering the price of flights,  I think this  seems very poor.  UK Airways is  running a budget ! In fact airlines currently rated  lower than BA  and the Top 100 airlines (eg  Air Atlantic and Malaysian Airlines) still  provide complimentary on  board snacks. There  was two in flight meals on this flight -  On both occasions  I was not  given the meal  of my choice  as it had  run out. Once,  we could forgive - but twice? When I complained  of this to the flight staff  at the second  flight (keep in  mind this was  near the end  to the flight ). I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal  seat for 10  hours - the  attendant informed me that 'I was travelling to a  foreign country and  I should be  charged for the food I was '. How rude!  Please do not book flights with  passengers to get  ignored by your  flight staff. The quality of the meals have dropped dramatically. No crackers or cheese, no . What is  now served with  my mail meal is coleslaw and  pizza (both of which I intensely !). This is what made the  issue of complimentary  meals on the  flights even more  - I'd had  little choice in  this menu, and  what was served  there was unpalatable.  You have to take medication that  needs to be  consumed with food . I had no choice but  to purchase food  on board. An  additional charge on  an already expensive  flight is a  tough pill to  swallow"
2.0,"From Heathrow to New York. Paid  money to pre-book my seats as  our wife is  the nervous flyer  but likes a window seat. Before we even left  they changed our  seats to a  lower aisle without  warning us. Luckily I spotted this  on the booking  app and changed  her back to  a window seat. To cut a  LONG story short for the return  trip we were moved to a middle aisle seats even though the  seats had been upgraded to a  balcony On complaining  to the airport  I were told  our flight was  already booked and  if we should  return when we  arrived back home , we would  receive a refund. I was told  they are always  doing this'. On  arriving back to  The UK on  Easter Eve I  called Customer Service and was told  they would receive  my refund (I  provided the Customer  Services Operators name  / ID number)  and no refund.  I completed the  BA complaints form , I received  the acknowledgment -  nothing happened. I  complained to the Chief Executive, no  refund nothing. I wrote to the  HR Department, no  response nothing. I  emailed Customer Services  today and was told the Refund Department is so  bad I will  not fly with BA again. To  this British Airway  customer Service response  I completely understand  why you’re unhappy you didn’t get your preferred seats. I apologise for  any inconvenience caused  for you. I  believe we can  see you and your travel companions on board again ! My response  is that 'I don't think so'."
9.0,"Flew British Airways  twice from Tampa  to Athens and  back via London Gatwick outbound and  Paris Heathrow inbound. The Boeing 777 outbound was a bit scruffy but  overall a good  seat The new IFE had been installed on the  previous aircraft, but  was map inoperable  and seemed to  had been loaded with very few movies and TV options. Crew excellent  on all flights. I continue to  use BA for long trips - they really work ! The seat  belts do not come up all  the way but  this was the only annoyance. Not  certain if I like the new charges for food on the European  flight - 5GBP was steep for  coffee and tea  from plastic cups."
8.0,"Hong Kong to London on an A380 in business  Class I like  the upper deck  seat and at my preferred seat,  have complete privacy.  The food is adequate, of large quantity though not superior quality. Drinks are served generously.  Very good arrival lounge at LHR, a necessity as flight arrives at 4:50am."
1.0,"My mother who is 79 years old who is  all too well and myself, booked business class tickets on BA676 to Istanbul on 7th Jan 2017 and requested disabled person assistance for my Mother. The flight got cancelled due to bad weather at IST, this is understood,  but when we tried to reschedule the flight, we faced a mess and nightmare with the staff who  would not know how or what  they should do as Istanbul airport was shut due to snow. We nearly got rebooked on a flight to Munich which we refused as BA ticketing agent did not know that the Turkish incoming flight to Munich was cancelled - I had to show her where to look on the web before making us travel to Munich where we would have got stranded. In total we were stranded at Heathrow for 15 hours and managed  after that to fly to Istanbul via Athens on Aegean Airlines at 22:30 and the next day from Athens being delayed by nearly 21  hrs When finally we got the option to travel Via Athens, We  had to go and collect our  belongings When we  applied for the Pre-Arranged assistance for my Mother, we were told No assistance was available due to the facts that there were many people needed help. We had to walk the very long distance back through immigration from BA’s lounge at T5. We went to what was marked as Luggage Desk  (# Word), were  forced to go alone to collect  our luggage out of nearly 2000 pieces of luggage because other flights were cancelled. When  asking for transport to T2, a  shuttle was offered which links the terminals - had  to take a taxi at a cost of £20.00 to get to T2. I asked for a refund of part of the ticket, I received a general reply without any joy! British Airways need to look around you and learn from other airlines, I was surprised with the  quality of Aegean Airlines, so pleasant staff, clean aircraft, the comfort of the seat and quality of the food. All which are missing with BA."
8.0,"from Heathrow to  Frankfurt Tegel. A  short flight. Food  was good for  the short-haul flight , business class,  but I note , there is  no longer free  snacks and drink  during Economy. Now  I sell M&S ! But the  problem is whether  this is worth  eating while flying  a short-haul. I did only because  that is one  in my long  haul segments. I  bought nothing and  things turn out  and exceed my  budget "
8.0,"Paris to Salzburg return in business class, and these  are pleasant flights,  with both flights arriving early. The flight out was  in morning, so a hot breakfast was provided with . On the  way back, afternoon  coffee was provided, rather than lunch, which was odd  for a flight leaving at 14.00 local time."
4.0,"Gatwick to Barbados, outbound on 19th January and returning  in February. Over many years and  travelling to many parts of the  world our last  trip was a  eye opener to  just what bean counters can do  and ruin a  good reputation. Please British Airways, you  will improve."
8.0,"On to London Gatwick. As a former Executive Gold  Certificate holder (7  years running), my  short haul travels  were stopped due  a change of  airline so sadly  changed my status, back to ""blue"".  I have just  been flying again with British Airways  and just recently, the Bordeaux to  London route, once  operated by a  747 and now replaced by the more modern A320.  Imagine my surprise the cabin looks  really nice (although the leg room  appears to have  compared to that  at Ryanair) and  has a pleasant  flight Sadly discovered  one has to  be for wine  or food on board now (economy)  and the wines  were not good  I am a wine trade professional).  Regarding the food  service ""M&S"" concept,  Why don't they get M&S to  give them the  wine too? Years  back the selection  system at British  airports was different  but the wines were then great!  However overall my  flights to Gatwick  was enjoyable, the  staff professional, and  much more expensive than EasyJet on  this same route.  The next BA trip is on  November 18th, this  time to Shanghai.  I am concerned,  continuing to read  the generally appalling  reviews about BA's long haul routes by various travellers and worry about  when to expect  when on my  next flight, in  fact I hope  someone is taking  the comments onboard seriously."
9.0,"London Heathrow to San Francisco return. Upgraded from Premium economy to Business  economy outward leg . Business as  standard on return. Both legs on the A380 which is a super plane, spacious, comfortable and clean. Entertainment screens are so much bigger than those on the older 747's. Both flights were very good with attentive, friendly cabin crew and excellent food. My only complaint was that the inbound flight was  20 minutes past  boarding time and this was sufficient for me to miss my connecting ! BA should never book connections with such a  late schedule. Problem was compounded by disinterested ground staff, especially a BA manager at T5 who was more interested in continuing  his conversation with colleagues than assisting a passenger who  needed helping to  pay his wages."
5.0,"Aberdeen to Paris  and London Heathrow. British Airways has stooped to its  lowest level of  incompetence by introducing  the well-marketed and poorly executed scheme , M& S Tie-up on catering  to European and Domestic routes. BA is where a  passenger has to  feel thirsty for  even a 3 hr flight to  their Europe destination  without a credit  & debit card.  Leave alone any  alcoholic drink, even  one cup of water is charged. No cash accepted.  Down to lowest  amount of customer  service from being a renowned airline. I will evaluate  the other options before travelling BA in domestic and  European routes, although I am a  BA member. "
3.0,"London Heathrow to Copenhagen. My first time experiencing British Airways buy-on-board service. This must be brand suicide at its worst. How BA can go from a full-service carrier to low  fares overnight is astounding. The brand is now cheapened, the offering before wasn't gourmet, but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit, now you can't even get hot water for free. Even SAS offer a complimentary coffee. What ceases to amaze me is more and more is taken away by British Airways in every single class you travel, yet you don't see a decrease  on ticket prices. The positives to this flight were that it was on time and the crew were  fantastic , but  i do feel it must be a complete embarrassment for them."
8.0,"From Heathrow to  DC Dulles. My  second long haul  flight with British  Airlines Flight on  this quite new , spotless aircraft.  Very friendly and  attentive cabin crew.  Quick lunch followed  by the snack . 1 hour  prior to landing.  Wide choice of  loud and soft  seats Informative cockpit . Wide choice  of IFE. Cons:  Little legroom in  cabin (additionally limited ) the electronix ) beneath the  seats Overall I  am impressed. Decent  flight for the  money paid. I 'd definitely fly  for BA again."
2.0,"Heathrow to Hong  HK in Business  class on 3rd  October as part  of a holiday  in New Zealand,  and involving flights with Cathay Pacific  or Malaysia Airlines.  This flight to Hong Kong with  Thai Airways showed  that all that 's bad about British Airways now , how far  that has fallen  from other airlines.  The continual penny pinching and poor  flying attitude was  apparent throughout the  journey Check-in at  gate 5 was  still there having  suffered a ""computer glitch"" which greatly  affected the check-in  / bag drop processes. There were  too few BA  employees on hand  for assist and  staff that were in evidence were  being continually harassed. Business check-in was  fine but still very busy. BA  needs to speed up bag drop  procedures Other airports  require you to  print your own  bag labels and  allow your baggage  individually to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where  another member of  staff checks the  bag to make  certain it is  never too heavy,  Not perfect for  business passengers but would considerably speed  down the process for the vast majority of passengers  who can check  bags easily. The  airport was a  mess with tired  wooden furniture, used  furniture not being cleared, too few  toilets for the number of passengers , very poor  food availability. Not  a great place  for rest before an 11 hour  flight and I  do concur with  some comments about  the deteriorating standards.  Contrast this to  my other ""home""  experiences of other  airports such as  those at Hong  Chau and Kuala  Airlines Took a  photo whilst waiting  but that was . The flight  is not good  for all. Cabin crew showed general  lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested  only just getting  our meals served and then disappearing  from view for  a rest of  a flight until  there was time  of the meal  and prior to . Gone are  also the small  or not so  small touches that made flying with  BA a pleasure,  such as hanging up coats, hot towels, a second  round of drinks, a nice meal , a leisurely  conversation and an overall feeling of  very well looked after. A comment  about the seats,  How can BA justify 8 across  in Business Class?  Since the ying/yang  seats were first  invented they were  in revolution, but  a lot of  other airlines now  do have 6  seats with a lot more space  for comfort and in most cases  passengers don't have  to climb over  a person to  hang out whilst  they are sleeping.  We had a  comfortable seat and  still felt very  strapped in. There was no storage space for the things you need  on a flight,  like tablet computer,  drink bottle etc.  They were kept  off the floor , crammed down  the side of the seat. Sadly <mask> is no longer my airline <mask> choice. I <mask> many years <mask> international business travel and when <mask> saw the Union Flag on <mask> tailfin at <mask> distant airport <mask> knew you <mask> already nearly <mask> I saved <mask> considerable number of Avios points <mask> my retirement <mask> I am <mask> using up, <mask> on other airlines within the <mask> World Alliance <mask> possible and <mask> offer a <mask> better product and actually look <mask> their passengers and make them <mask> wanted. Sorry <mask> but you've lost my loyalty. <mask> World is <mask> very poor (and also Club <mask> now) and <mask> lost the <mask> to the <mask> counters. Never <mask> I'd say <mask> but I've joined the ABBA <mask> anybody but BA."
8.0,"Flight to Mauritius : Absolutely fine from online check in, baggage drop , Gatwick to  checking baggage in , Allocated seats together (2 passengers)  and at online  checking in, with no need to  switch these. Pleasant  & courteous staff member at baggage drop. Boarding by  business class and row numbers and  went pretty smoothly.  Boeing 777 about  40 years old, but still in presentable condition. I'm  2 m. tall , medium build  but I found  the seat pretty  decent for a 12-hour flight in economy - at  last this aircraft type is still  kept abreast despite  the slightly dated look of the  cockpit Not the  largest seat screen I've experienced but  good and there  was a reasonable  choice of movies,  TV and music. Drinks service followed by hot meal (roast chicken in sauce or veggie ) We ate in the terminal  before departing just in case the food offering was going to be  limited but despite  the reduction in  portions given on the tray we couldn't really fault what was provided.  Lost out after  departure until about an hour before landing when a hot breakfast was  provided Cabin crew friendly and efficient  - with water  flowing through the  door plus option  of get drinks  in the galley. Landed on time. Spent ages in  the queue at immigration, luggage waiting for us and then taxi to  hotel We got  back safely, on time and in  relative comfort. Return  home a week later pretty much the same as  expected"
1.0,"Flight from Los  Vegas to Nice  to London Heathrow.  Two words: Travel Nightmare. Every leg  for my British  Connection flight was  canceled including one  which was delayed  owing to a  technical issue that  could take 10  or 2 hours  after we took  flight Late inbound  departure caused me  TO miss my  flight which British  Airlines charged me  late fees and  waited in a  2 hour line  to rebook. Inflight  the audio system  did not work , which was  quickly resolved and  received no compensation  was a result.  By far the  worst travel my  family or I  have ever experienced,  and will be  with this airline 's life."
2.0,"Back to London Heathrow, and my first trip on BA since they  offered any type  a complimentary service  options for us lowly economy cabin travellers. This is now some weeks on since they  introduced their buy onboard snack options, but cabin staff acted like it was their first  choice and that they had no . Okay, it might not be easy for them, but they all appeared very bad tempered with customer  complaints about the new Ryanair style  snacks and a  bit of tutting as they served those who decided to buy something. I am sick and tired of the CEO of BA telling us  that this is  all their customers asked for. Be honest and accept  that this is  another ploy to  raise your personal bonus at the  beginning of year  to keep shareholders happy. That said, it seems the BA reputation is  in the slide  on many markets, and that's where shareholders should be truly worried. (And no, I sold  some BA shares many years ago!)."
1.0,"On to Barcelona return, and just dreadful pretty much  sums up this British Airways business class experience. Since BA moved to Gatwick south terminal, their new lounge  is still not ready. They're currently using the clubrooms  of the old Virgin Atlantic lounge,  formerly called the  VIP lounge. Gold card holders and passengers travelling in business or first  must use the clubrooms. What a sorry state this  terminal was. Full,  but limited seating, a forty minute  delay for food, no available snacks and empty drinks cabinets. I left  as hungry and thirsty as I arrived. No to worry though, British  Airways will feed me onboard. Once onboard, for a  four hour flight, I was served  a tea which  consisted of three finger sandwiches, a scone and a really small slice  a cake. This  meal was completely  unnecessary There was one drinks round  available and one  drink up offered. Given that BA use the smallest glasses possible, coupled with its love of miniature cans  and lemonade, you 'll be thirsty. I found trading  up to business  passengers to be completely not worth  the extra spend. After being disappointed by the outbound catering my disappointment was set to continue with the  exact same afternoon tea meal served on my inbound flight. Staff were indifferent and spent most of their time chatting in  private"
1.0,"Sofia to London  - The flight was on time, but British Airways  just slipped to  the budget airline  status  I've  loved using BA for many years, but my next holiday is booked on another airline. I cannot score more than 1 even for cabin crew, as I didn't receive any  service onboard. Almost 3 hour flight and not one  comment or moment  for attention from  the cabin crew. You receive attention only if you ask to buy  something from them - food, water . Crew is not guilty, they are victims of  a new airline  and BA just lost it's Class. ."
10.0,"Flight to Barcelona return via London (premium economy transatlantic, economy on short ). Comfortable flights , first-rate cabin service both ways. A late departure  by BCN on the return trip due to fog  from London was  easily made up for and I made my connection to Washington with  hours to spare. Also, my checked bag did not make it on the original flight  into Barcelona but  baggage claim was put in for and my bag was delivered to  our hotel the following morning. Concerning  BA M&S food and drink service  on European sectors, I don't normally eat on short-hauls, but I did note that one of the drinks  we offer in this service is  a favourite ale, Old Speckled Hen, not previously seen by me on  an airline (I paid with Avios).  I don't enjoy  having to pay for something that was once available for free, but sometimes there are compensations. BA is still my first  airline for international travel and get  you to/from my destination in comfort , with attentive,  efficient service."
7.0,"Welcome to London Heathrow, and I  had really, really  hoping that British Airways had refurbished  their interior of  this Boeing 747 I was flying on. Sadly this was not the case. The seats were uncomfortable and the video screens  are about half the size of an iPad and definitely looked as  thought they were 20 years old. The service was  good and flight attendants would pass by regularly with refreshments."
3.0,"London Heathrow to Milan return. How British Airways have fallen in their service and product - they are no better than Ryanair now and  honestly unless LHR is convenient to  travel I would seek another airline. Not even a drink offered unless  you pay although  one passenger stated  this was free but it was  actually offered. Seats the same as  everyone else and they insist on putting these silly yellow cabin bag bands on carry  in bags like they mean anything. I checked a bag so just  found a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached  which I immediately ripped off. The  one benefit was my frequent flier tier meant I got early boarding,  it is my last trip through  this as the  boarding procedure is so awful. American Airlines are now better than British Airways and that  says it all."
2.0,"Flew British Airways  to London Gatwick  to Bridge Town. Flight good, staff attentive. Inflight food shocking. Second year running no choice  but a pasta.  No whole meal  was Economy with a big E.  No doubt the  meal tray cost ! The only  real food was  instant coffee and  the world's smallest KitKat. For an  18 + hour flight appalling. BA should be ashamed and/or put another Ten pounds on the ticket and give a proper meal. Have flown Virgin, Thomas Cook etc outstandingly BA the worst. Fly Virgin. "
4.0,"So the mighty  have fallen, or  shall I say  started to fall.  my partner and  i booked tickets  for London to  Glasgow back in  November 16, we  spend approx £1700  for the 2  night tickets (slightly  less than normal  considering we paid  for extra leg o seats). It  was an evening flight and we 're traveling on  something relatively new  aircraft our first  problem was that  sadly there was not enough room for our hand bags near to  the seats, so  luggage was placed  around 30 feet  further down the  flight - not  really threatening, just  uncomfortable when you  have to get  food out of  a bag, we  are surprised about  this lack of  space Our real  problem was that  when it came  to serving our  evening meal that  a flight attendant  said ""here is  the vegetable lasagne""  Rather than explaining  it for our  money they were  then able to  give us the  normal evening meal , or beef)  options they had  run out of  food They made  every effort to  remedy the situation,  but there were  other choices in  comfort or business  I will never  be all I 'll say is  as I am  very easy to  find when it  came to food  but wasn't happy  eating a vegetable , so I  received no meal  as a result.  When I left the aircraft I  received a text  to BA asking  my feedback on  my flight, I  took the time  I respond   to all the  replies but received  zero response. Whilst  i was in  London I tried  and contact/ call  someone to complain , trying to  try and speak  with anyone at  all is like  attempting to get  an audience with  Don Francis! I  finally received an email response stating  how my complaint  did qualify for  financial redress, I  immediately challenged this,  BA explained that  in a hypothetical  scenario whereas the  airline paid for  the fare as  they left the  aircraft 1) would  they have been  required to pay  the full cost  on the flight , and 2)  that BA if  they were reasonable,  wanted me to  cover the full cost. In summary,  there eventually was  a £15 credit  for my next  return flight -  totally unacceptable as I don't fly  very often, even £15 shopping vouchers  or an apology  could have been  acceptable I felt  really disappointed with  a national carrier  for it's onboard  policies and the  BA for it's  passenger relations which  really doesn't give a damn. Looking  forward the point that made me  so angry was  its total disinterest  from me."
2.0,"London Heathrow to Zurich. Because of fog in morning at Heathrow I have called BA and checked online for delays of  the late afternoon flight. I was told several times that the flight was on time. After a disorganized boarding, the door of the aircraft was closed 15  mins late. Then  the captain informed us about a  30 minutes delay of departure, because of fog in the morning at Heathrow Airport. At the end we arrived with 1.5 hours delay in Zurich. When airborne  we were informed about the new catering concept (!) of British Airways  to Economy Class Passengers on European flights. You have to pay for food and the drinks. Thanks to the delay we spent more then  1 and a half hour on a BA plane and we did  not receive a  single glass of water."
2.0,"Madrid to London.  A chaotic check in, largely down to the Iberia , Boarding was  smooth and friendly  away from cabin , Seats are cramped and on  a par with  airline cost standards,  but was reasonably . Flight crew gave good information.  First the crew  started the new food and drink sales, and this  was where the  problem started. The time they were taking for each row they served  were excruciating. I  was seated 9  row back and  sat up waiting for a drink and dozed off. Before landing I  went to my neighbour and asked  when they finally got served ...  he said the  drinks had all run out long before staff got them. This was  such a cheap  service that I got, and British  Airlines state publicly  that their customers asked for this  complimentary service, buy  vouchers etc. What a lie, I 've yet to meet anyone who  has been asked what they wanted in the many months before BA  introduced any complimentary  service Sad to  say our national  airline has slipped  well below the  ranks of Lufthansa and Air France."
9.0,"London Heathrow to  Edinburgh return. Very  enjoyable experience both . Mature crew outbound with longer  lines for drinks and meal service,  more energetic younger  staff on return,  but everything happened  smoothly and efficiently.  All crews friendly  crew had control  of the cabin,  it made for a relaxed atmosphere.  A noticeably better  than of late , I hope  that will continue.  On return my  last onward flight  cancelled due to  weather but rebooking  has been done  at the time  I checked in . PHL and  they had a  nice message also  having that effect.  Engine Room fine  in ways though  and is starting to look a  bit frayed, but  was acceptable even  with the food  / beverage staff  do not always  do very much.  All in all  a solid enjoyable  experience I would  suggest that this  also applies to  the most recent  flight as others  had not been  so positive."
2.0,"A decline of British Airways. My review is primarily  for BA Euro Traveller in economy. Up to two years ago one felt good when travelling BA. They  are miles ahead of budget airlines. Yes they were  a bit more  pricey but one enjoyed reasonable food  or beverage, checked in cases of  luggage all part of the service.  Now BA provides no free food or beverage, and  charges extra payment for check in luggage. Today, within Europe, BA has  absolutely no advantage  to EasyJet, Norwegian, Monarch or even Ryanair. Why should anyone pay extra  with BA, they have lost absolutely  their unique selling ? Incidentally coming back from Malta to London Gatwick in BA in business class, there is nowhere to hang coats. Previously BA flight attendants always hung them  in a cupboard. And now NO CUPBOARDS! Extra seats ! The Decline  And Fall of  a once proud BA. In future BA will need to to meet  and be cheaper  than the budget airlines.

1.0,"i was returning  home for my  flight on December 27, 2016, connecting  with British Airways  at London Heathrow to Abuja. The  hotel I had chosen was changed to a horrible  hotel near the  hotel I never got an explanation  of this action.  But I wasn't  too fussy about  that as I  was very excited to be getting . Also, the  plane was dirty,  The food was terrible and took  hours to get  to in the first place. Our  flight arrived at  London Abuja airport  where I was  told to get  onto another flight  of two hours to my final  stop within Nigeria.  They went to claim my luggage at the carousel,  we waited for  me till all  my luggage had  gone through and  I couldn't find my luggage which  contained my wedding  pictures in it,  not my wedding ! As you  might imagine I  was devastated, I  tried to cancel  our connecting flight  and my final  day in order  the sort out  this issue. I  slept the night  at Abuja hoping that my luggage  would come in  on the flight  to the next  week as only  the BA flight  runs from Heathrow  in Abuja each day. My luggage  only arrived the  next day. Myself , my husband  proceeded to spend a hideous amount  of money purchasing  our wedding items.  The BA staff  of the airport weren't helpful at all, they were  all very rude and none of  the could give us any reasonable  explanation as to  where my luggage ! My luggage  only arrived about 5 days after  the wedding in  the very bad  shape Up till this day, BA  still refused to acknowledge my claims  and they haven't  paid me for  paying the expenses  during the course  and flying with . BA ruined  What was supposed  To be the  best day of  our life and I have vowed  again never fly  for BA. "
6.0,"The Heathrow to  Cape Town return.  Having previously flown  in First Class  in the Boeing  747 and A380,  a trip on  an ageing Boeing  747 from Heathrow  at 3 was . The sooner  they replace these  seats the better. I had a window seat which  very least was not as cramped  and the middle  one which looked  nothing like BA's  expensive Club World seats. The first disappointment came after  3 meals only to be told : due to  a cabin crew  shortage which had  ended the day  after we were flying, we would  get a Club World meal instead.  … There are only 14 First  World seats and  the caterers were  also on strike so quite annoyed  would be offered  very few AVIOS  for compensation! The  cinema screen quality  is poor and  our movie selection  not particularly good.  Another good thing was that we  had 2 excellent ladies serving in  the cabin. BA  needs to stop  using their premium  fares with contempt  and wake up  too the fact  this is a  matter of competition. Priority boarding is  a joke; anybody with a Bronze  or club card  knows that so half the aircraft  goes to the  same gate. Priorities  are re-assessing (and controlling). Special needs and First Class  go first and then trickle down  from there. They  will need to  update the aircraft  to a better  way or replace  seats more quickly."
5.0,"London Heathrow to  fly in First  class British Airways.  It was better  after my last trip in Club  America but having  just come off  the back of  an extended trip  to Asia (not with BA), one quickly realises how sub-par most of  the BA experience has become. Airport  staff at Heathrow distinctly average and  second style. Onboard,  some staff friendly, some surly and  some lazy. Loos  were not checked or cleaned throughout  each flight. While I don't fly  or dine, this  feels more like pub grub compared  to top first  rate airlines, and  fuel saving is clearly evident. IFE  was okay. Trouble is there is no proper competition on this route,  as US carriers can't be classified  within the first  tier league."
6.0," San Francisco to  Paris via London.  These two flights  were as different as night and day. Both night flights so the  aim was to get as much sleep as possible. SFO-LHR BA286 19th January was a full Business Class  flight but amazing service by mature  Flight attendants. Perfect mix of professionalism,  class and efficiency  - the Boeing  737 had seen  best days. They  had the main  flight service done and dusted within  2 hours allowing for plenty of  sleep LHR-JNB, BA055  - 20th January was an absolute disgrace. Great aircraft , let down  but shambolic and  rude in flight  - These attendants  are much younger  but besides looking  old and miserable  their main meal  service took 4  hrs - this  was a night flight. Post take  off drinks were  taken relatively quickly. There was then  one massive gap  when that and  a meal order  were taken. And  yet further huge  difference between the  food service being  taken All the  food being delivered  with the most  rude steward I've  ever had the displeasure to encounter.  As a Gold  Pass holder the CSM (who was  a delight) came  to give me her 'personal welcome' and I did feedback about my experience. She acknowledged  all these new bies are 'inexperienced'  which I said , no excuse  the rudeness. Why can BA not  give the old and new crew  alike if the newbies cannot get to grips with a basic efficient . Later had the pleasure of  flying JNB-CPT on Comair (a BA  subsidiary in South Africa). What a  wonderful little airline.  A very young , but an  overall delight. Overall , give the journey a 6/10 , my breakdown  would be SFO-LHR , LHR-JNB 2/10,  and 9/10. I've checked the Recommend ations - but  if you are  on a night  out with the new contract crew,  call them"
4.0,"I flew from  London to Larnaca . The aeroplane  looked old and tired, uncomfortable seats,  and TV screens  and can hardly be viewed from the seats we  had chose. My headphones did not  fit in the  cockpit either. But  apart from it  being a somewhat  comfortable ish journey  no offering of  food and drink  was shocking. We can only choose  Food and drink  through a Marks  and Spencer's booklet,  trust me the  service is not  acceptable to M&S  and they should  really have put  their good name  on this BA  product to cut  off Whilst I  accept that the  scheme was only  just introduced and  customers are forced  and be teething  with the fact  that we can  only pay for  it by credit , which had  some clients scrambling  for overhead lockers  was shameful. What  the earth are  we thinking about?  UK Airways are  really letting themselves down badly. We  felt like low  cost airline customers  if we had  set a high  price for our  flights Indeed if  we had flown with Easyjet or  Monarch we would  have saved ourselves  hundreds of pounds.  We will certainly  be seeking out  other airlines for  more frequent bookings to Cyprus (which  translates to at least 5 or  6 trips a  week  M&S, don't spoil your  sterling reputation with  another venture."
8.0,"Flew Economy from London to Manchester in August 2016.  Customer service was really good even for this short flight. The crew were smiley, the  fare offered was okay (before BA  added free food and drinks in 2017), and the flight departed on time. London Heathrow T5 was good , the queues weren't too long,  especially though it was peak Summer  flight"
7.0,"We flew British Airways from Lisbon to San Jose via London. Lisbon  - London the seats were ok, basically coach seats but the middle seat is blocked off. The crew on that flight was very good. We were a  tad apprehensive about the configuration of seats on the long haul Boeing 787 from London to San Jose. I had a middle seat, 7E, but it turned out fine, but definitely narrower than the seats on other airlines business  so I did not need to go over anybody to get in  and out, however the other middle seats might not have been as easy. Staff on the London to San Jose flight was good but not warm or personal. The food quality was better than some airlines."
1.0,"Flight to Phoenix  on British Airways . Premium economy. Possibly the worst  flight service and flight attendants ever,  on outward and  interior flight. The  plane was dirty,  cold and smelly.  The cabin crew  is rude, unhelpful  and their customer , who simply  ignored your complaints. British Airways should  go for budget airline."
2.0,"Flew from Gatwick  to Tampa Business  Class on 7th . The experience  should only be  described as appalling.  All business class  toilet facilities were  made available due  our move to  the terminal. We  needed to use the general lounge  which any passenger  willing to pay  extra could use. This meant it  felt overcrowded and  busy (through no fault of the ) staff. They  just could not  come up with  our number of  people We could  hardly get a  seat anywhere and  after we advised  BA staff of  it we were  advised to come  in later and  see if there  are any seats ? The BA  flight staff were  clearly overwhelmed by  a number of  economy class passengers  onboard and appeared  at their wits ! The flight  felt mediocre to  say the least. The food was  ok and the  staff satisfactory. Having  paid £2000 for  the ticket it 's not unreasonable  to expect a  worse service. We  then complained to  UK Airways via  its customer services department and the  representative came back  saying they were  moved to the  main terminal and  we needed to  be understanding as  it would get  worse in the  queue We were  never even offered  the refund on  a tea we  purchased in the  lounge area of  our terminal as  we could not  squeeze into the  service they had provided. This is  not good customer  service and we  will not in  to travel with British Airways, we 'll be travelling , even if  that means we  need to get  the connecting flights  at our destination.

1.0,"Flew British Airways from Miami to London Heathrow on 15th January and the aircraft was filthy in Economy class. Pulled out the tiny TV  from under the  table and there was hair attached. Opened the armrest to retrieve table and the dirt was disgusting, this has been an accumulation over a long period of time. TV didn't work and after  3 hours into a 8.5 hour flight and the  airline trying to re-boot it 3 times I finally asked what could be done. I had paid extra for a seat  that had extra leg room (seat 29A) as there is no seat in front and you could stretch  them out. There was a seat free in Business class but the Manager on the flight made it clear that he was 'not allowed' to move me. I traveled business class on the outbound flight on 3rd Jan but did not feel that it was value for money. I will stick with Emirates or Virgin in the future as I  believe the aircraft are clean with  excellent customer service. I logged this complaint onboard at the time but a week later still heard nothing,  does surprise me."
5.0,"From Heathrow to Dubai, and a delayed flight. Poor  attitude from LHR British Airways staff. Horrible food. Crowded flight and a  free mini bite size for breakfast.  No crew. All  that money they have made seems to go to  the management. A disgrace and sad to have experienced,  and will avoid them."
3.0,"Never again! Booked  a round trip  trip to London from Paris return  on British Airways in business as  with a separate ticket from Paris  to Johannesburg (with  Holland in business  class and Cape  Coast to Paris (with Qatar in business class). On  my outbound flight  few issues apart  form the appalling  weather in London , Checked in for my return  flight online and  To my surprise  the charge for  choosing your seat before check in  – which I  thought strange being a business class . The reason  i chose the  same flight was  because it was from the same airport (CDG) as where my flight  to Cape Town  from Doha arrived  and after a  long haul flight  The last thing I wanted was  to have any hassle with the connection to London.  So plan was  just get refreshed in the lounge,  chat for few  drinks and get  onto the flight. Unfortunately, my plans  got trashed when I arrived at  flight check in and was told  the my flight  had been cancelled , that I  had been rebooked  at Orly (which  took an hour !). It didn't stop there, no transfer was provided  and when asked  where do I  get there, the  only reply was  I get a  taxi No indication of where. The  manager simply turned  away from me , started talking  about a colleague.  Trying to get  some more information to which the  answer was ""go "". She gave me a paper  which I thought  might be a map to the bus but it  turns out to  just a sheet  of guidelines on  how to get  home Thought ok, at least something.  The next shock,  as I arrived in Orly. The check in lady told me that  because of business  class had put  us in economy!  Since I was very tired and  I wanted to  come home, agreed , asked if  they still use  their lounge. Oh no, not possible!  By this point , was absolutely  devastated and asked  a speak to  the manager. Was  told that it 's not possible  but that I  would go online  to complain. Gave up and went  through security to find out that the flight was delayed again. Spoke to the same  person who tried to ignore me  and kept repeating  things online, I  didnt care about ! When back , complained to  customer services and got a reply that no compensation  was due as  BA had ran  dry of staff  who operate that  flight Complained again  and had the  response from the  other ground crew  for compensation. Generic reply after 5  mins was, no ! Needless to  add I will  not fly with  BA again which  seems a shame  as do like  many oneworld partners  that I frequently  fly with in  business class and  economy a FF <mask> not of BA)."
1.0,"Very fair for  the fare. Flew  on to Paris  via London with  Qatar Airways. Not  able to choose  your seats. The cabin was not  comfortable (lot of  rows 8 seats  per row in , no privacy,  some of the  rows don't have  direct access to  an aisle. Bad  ventilation in small  window Not enough . Tiny PTV 's and poor  equipment selection. Crew  was very friendly , helpful. We  have to face  the bad mood  from the ground staff in London , were very  strict and refused to let us  bring our hand bags on the  Frankfurt to Paris flight. We explained  that we were in Business class  and that we  deal with the same cases at  each beginning of our vacation, they  took care and  asked us to bring it on board. After 30 minutes I showed  why they were  in a size  limit by BA. They recognized their mistake and let  me take it.  10 minutes of stress because they  didnt do their job properly. Won't  take BA again,  as for the cabin crew everything  looks bad and looking like budget !"
3.0,Paris to London  Airport with British Airways. Absolutely ludicrous  decision to carry on baggage allowance on this flight.  Just arrived at my seat as  my plane was  already approximately a third boarded and  suddenly the overhead lockers in the  back or 4  on either side  were jammed to  capacity with huge  bags that could not possibly have came even close  with the permitted size allowed for  this cabin. I struggled to squeeze my jacket into a gap between 2 massive cases and had to keep my small  suitcase containing only my change of clothes between my feet for the flight. No idea how how such  large oversized and overweight bags were  brought onboard but  this made for a pretty uncomfortable flight. Pretty disappointing  for an airline whose standards seem  TO be sliding .
10.0,"British Airways is a very good airline. Yesterday I was coming back from Bangkok to  Dubai and I  missed my flight, because I feel asleep at the airport (I had a sleepless night and food poisoning).  It did me big favour and  booked next available flight (next day)  free of charge. Never happened to  me with another airline. Very impressed."
6.0,"Return to Cape Town. Galleries lounge at T3 tatty  but overcrowded. Takeoff delayed by an  hours because of weather issues, but  we were kept well informed while  boarding for push back. Seats 62J/K on upper deck  good for a couple, although the plane was looking  its age, with patching up wherever you looked. IFE  was past its  planned replacement date, with small screen , poor resolution.  Cabin crew friendly enough. Meal the  typical sub-standard BA  fare with diminishing portion sizes and overcooked mains. Hotel  breakfast chocs have now disappeared. Arrival  at CPT only 30 mins behind  from Cape Town  to London, the  departures lounge at  was spacious, but  quickly became packed with pax from  earlier flights. Food options dreadful, with the worst hot food we've encountered  in any business class lounge. Cheese pre-packaged. MCC available but no champagne. Push back 15 mins ahead of schedule. Same seats  in upper deck. Meal barely average and we avoided the hot option  during breakfast. Arrived ahead of schedule. Overall, the flight itself was the usual BA service. Onboard was another matter, with seats and service way below BA's competitors and at inflated  rates"
2.0,"17 September 2016,  I flew with  UK Airways in First from London  - Kuala Lumpur on flight BA0033.  First impressions were  good The check-in  were efficient with  ease and friendly  staff The Concorde  Lounge was a nice place to  stay My First  cabin (2A) offered  the good amount  more comfort, space and privacy. Fast forward 12+ hours.  Would I fly  with British Airways First again? No. Would I fly with British Airways again? No. This  is why: On the flight there  were two members of cabin crew  on the First  cabin with 8  seats The 1st cabin crew member  is polite and  helpful The 2nd  cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional. The supplied headphone  socket was faulty  and did not . I had  only ask twice  for a replacement ! It took over 40 minutes  to receive this.  While airborne, I ordered a cappuccino. I had to ask three times  for this and  waited over 50  seconds for it  would arrive. There  was multiple issues with my dinner:  Initially I was  only second person  to order my dinner; yet the  only person to  get served. It  took over 2  hours to get  this dinner. Someone  who had ordered after me, got  a dinner option  and was told some 30 minutes after placing my  order that only  that option was . It would appear that this  restaurant had a  special Executive Club  menu and therefore , given my  choice of main  meal I was  then given the  name of a  first World main  course (which was  delayed further as  it was initially  in the wrong ). This delay  to service had  a detriment to my own sleeping  arrangements and I  felt extremely disappointed  with the service  by the 2nd  flight crew member.  There were issues  regarding my breakfast: Despite being the  first passenger to  wake up and  get my breakfast, another passenger was served first and  ordered my breakfast.  Having ordered a  sandwich the 2nd  Cabin crew member  missed this order. When I enquired  again (some 40  minutes after I 'd placed my order) I was  told that the seat belt sign  were now on ; therefore I  should not have  it I was extremely disappointed as  in the material  when I placed  this order (and  spent some time  after this) there had been no  seats belt sign . The First  class toilet was  never cleaned properly  on the flight.  The Complaint Within  24 hours of  arrival in KUL,  i wrote a  formal letter of  complaint outlining the  following issues and emailed this to the CEO of  UK Airways, Alex  Jones The ‘You � department at  UK Airways confirmed receipt of my email. Subsequently, I received a very  negative response from  UK Airways Customer <mask> No attempt <mask> made to <mask> (or even <mask> the issues <mask> gave rise <mask> my complaint. <mask> was disappointing. <mask> was simply <mask> 10,000 Avios <mask> I responded <mask> return, rejecting <mask> offer and <mask> asked for <mask> explanation to <mask> I had <mask> such poor service during my <mask> and why <mask> attempt had <mask> made by <mask> Airways to <mask> the issues <mask> I had outlined in my <mask> complaint. The <mask> from British <mask> Customer Relations <mask> again disappointing <mask> did not <mask> any explanation other than the <mask> would be <mask> with internally <mask> that the <mask> of 10,000 <mask> points was <mask> British Airways <mask> to be <mask> so we’re <mask> to all <mask> customers”. I found this statement <mask> ironic."
2.0,"from Petersburgh to  London I don’t  see where BA  sees this market  is to say  about complementary meals,  we prefer to  ask for it , I’ve yet  again find anyone  who agrees with  my idea and  certainly no one asked me for  an opinion. If  I want to  buy something different, you always have  the option in  their endless airport shops before boarding.  I suggest they  look seriously at  some market research , if this  are true, though  we suspect the  real reason is  cost cutting, BA just doesn’t want  the admit it. BA would be  well off to  change it, customers  should have more  options than trying  to promote this policy as some  alternative to the  airlines when clearly  you are removing  something and keeping  it the same,  they can all  sit through the  blatant deception and  that does the  customer no good. To tell me  that charging £1.80  a water or soft drink is  no bargain when  we can buy  the same thing  in Tesco for  less insults my  intelligence they are  ignoring the fact  their passengers cannot  buy liquids through  bags so they have a captive  audience again a  false image to  sell to the . Where possible myself and family  members now actively seek to avoid  flying a BA  plane where any  problem exists. Pay  more for checked  luggage Pay extra for drinks, pay  extra for food,  very sorry to  say our flag  flying in such  dire state that  it is reduced to that of a budget airline."
2.0,"British Airways is a budget airline at premium airline  and Flew from Gatwick to Cancun. However, if you  like snacks (on a very long flight) you have to buy them on board, and  after a long flight and meals only at the beginning and end people get hungry. You do not  like to have to buy snacks  for such an expensive flight. There was also nowhere  to plug in laptops, which you expect on a long and expensive  flight when you  want work to  avoid The plane was also so cold (too cold to concentrate on work). It would take a great deal to choose them again."
1.0,"Flight to Zurich , London return,  by British Airways is absolutely appalling. I have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airline. I booked two return  premium economy seats  between my mother and I to  go from Shanghai to Zurich via  London On the way there, the flight to Zurich was cancelled due to French strike,  all BA's fault so that part  became clear. However, they kept the  plane on the  list until very last minute then  told everyone it  was cancelled, furthermore, they ran out  on hotels to  fill people up , we wasted  nearly 5 hours (after a 12  hour flight) to go through customs (thank god we can enter visa free unlike a  few other passengers),  find a hotel,  book our own  bags there and back. So the first leg already  had a terrible impression. Then, on the way back to Shanghai, they overbooked business so they pushed business  people into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and I  into economy for  another 12 hour flight. I booked premium economy for a reason, my  mother has health issues and need the room in premium economy, did BA care? No. Told us that we were involuntarily  seated upon check in but that  somehow we will still get a  ticket then at boarding, told us  that it's either  premium economy now  or wait till  departure to see  whether there is a seat. Because  I had work the next day,  we had no  alternative but to  complain and BA  let us on  with the promise that they will  fill in the  price difference request on my behalf which will be processed asap. Three months down the  road I have yet to see a single cent  of fare difference and of course  there are no  customer service phone numbers/emails to write  down only an  email link online for you to  find a reference and compliant to their customer service black hole. Needless to say I will forever boycott BA for its incompetence and insincerity  towards a paying  customer "
1.0,"We travelled Business jet from Gatwick  - Barbados return  at Christmas 2016.  On outbound flight  cabin had not  being cleaned well  after all -  food crumbs around seat area, stained  or wet toilet  seats etc. The  cabin crew member  were not aware  about taking passenger 's procedure and suggested we ""hang  ourselves up wherever  I can find space"" - we  did our own  luggage prior to  boarding When the  meal was served  it had been  labelled as 'not ' - when  our mistake was  made and the  complaint initially made  to the senior  passenger the two  menu options were  discussed - I  got cheese and  beer and my  friend went without. The quality of  the video/audio was  very poor -  the picture clarity  lost and the sound distorted making  some films unwatchable. On the return  flight the Executive  Cabin was fully  full and we  had to use  a packed lounge  in the main . During the inbound flight the  senior cabin steward was constantly chewing  gum - not  being very professional ! On our  departure the only  reply by BA  of our complaints  was additional Avios  vouchers - an  official response a  quick and reasonable , and an  opportunity that we  were unlikely to  take advantage of."
6.0,"Well I've checked  flights online hoping , it would actually speed things up when at the airport. Silly . The queue  is ridiculous for bag drop and  I had to spend over 2 hours waiting to drop my bag! The queue for  baggage check in was far quicker  so I think that things got  easier now. Maybe quicker to check  in at the  hotel So I 'm hoping to  have had time  to eat before  the flight. British Airways were completely  over staffed and  unprepared There were no signs of people trying to indicate where we  could go considering  these massive queues. Total fail. I felt I was  dealing with a  low cost airline. I kept checking  the flight details for any planned  departure - it 's obvious that  I was going  too be massively  delayed because of snow, etc, but the monitor and alerts were indicating  departures at 10.22  instead of the  planned departure at 10.00. Well, that  was the case  until 5 minutes before 10.22! Finally we got 'updated'.  Highly doubt that  BA was only  updating at that ? Why wasn't  it an update ? Anyway, new departure time scheduled  as 11.59. We  actually started boarding  by 11.00. Then, inside the cabin, we waited for  another hour until  take off. At no point did  anyone offer vouchers. We only ate  inside the cabin  at 2am. The  staff was terrible  - that's another  why I see no point at  all with BA (for a few years now). Staff are old and 'entitled'. When you 're not lucky enough to fly in a modern  airline you are presented with filthy dirty seats. Food getting worse and worse, and in board entertaining –  is non-existent. A few years ago  you could actually  still save miles,  today you get  absolutely nothing. BA  needs to be good not just  an ordinary lazy  travellers living from  past glories."
2.0,"I paid almost  nothing to fly  from London to  Berlin The flight took off and  then was re-routed  again to London  out of weather  with German air space closing. The communication to passengers  is horrible and it took two  weeks waiting in  Germany to get a hotel room,  just to learn  it still hadn't  made my flight.  Whilst waiting in  line I tried multiple times to  reach their customer service number, and  waited on hold for twenty minutes  at a time before hanging up due to international  mobile phone costs.  The rebooked flight  landed 22 hours after my original  flight was supposed  ta land, and  then that flight was delayed because  of broken air  conditioning Which was  right after we 'd boarded and  was sitting on  the tarmac during  my rare London  flight I landed  over a day later than planned,  as my bag didn't make it from London for  almost four days.  US Airways provided  clear guidance for  my baggage and  flight related expenses  I reimburse, yet  was denied portions  to my claim. The delays, lost  flight and frustrating experience dealing with  airlines really ruined the first part  of my holiday. I complained to  the customer service  representative and after  another lot of  hand and forth,  were offered a 20 pound travel . Such a  bad experience with  an airline, will never fly them !"
1.0,"Flight from Athens to Heathrow delayed by 30 minutes which seems to be the ""norm"" for this flight with BA. However a few minutes before call to board an announcement came over that that no food  and drink would be available on  this flight, no  explanation as to  a reason. Fortunately I was in the business lounge  so grabbed a can of coke and a couple  toilet rolls but for others they would have no time to purchase  them even if they are happy to pay airport prices. This was a 4 hour flight by the way. I had  little idea that BA are now charging for food  or drink even for water (they  kept that one quiet). I rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay  them for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat (they kept  that one quiet as well when  this policy was  announced last spring). How long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as Ryanair. Will they be selling lottery tickets next? Pay-as-you go toilet? British Airways still refer to themselves , ""the worlds favourite airline"". Based on who`s opinion  I See no point in using  BA now. They usually come out as one of the most expensive carriers when choosing a route. They  have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out  if any other  airline I fly about 100 times annually through business and try and avoid BA. With this latest money  saving scam I  may change my scheduling to avoid them. There are plenty other quality  companies who like BA are struggling to maintain profits. All have the same threat of  constantly fluctuating oil  and adverse weather, air-traffic control strikes etc. but they are not punishing the very people who keep their planes in the air."
1.0,"We had the ""pleasure"" of flying back to the UK on the first day of BA's fantastic idea of starting to  charge for drinks  or snacks (a  la sister company Iberia). Someone please explain to me what the difference is with Ryanair, Easyjet and Norwegian now? It's become a budget airline and I for one won't be using them anymore  until I can  guarantee it. They  cancelled the Avios for flights, made it more difficult  and go up tiers and now this joke? I'm not even bothered about the sandwich to be really honest but on a 4 hour flight I expect BA to give me a drink. Then when I wanted to buy a sandwich I was told that there were only 3 for the entire plane and they sold out. Salad then? Sold . Some crisps?  And the person  in front of  you got the last bag. BA 's aren't Iberia or Air Lingus.  Stop this nonsense please. Take an example to KLM. The week before, AMS - MAD, hot pasta, 2 rounds of drinks  and then cake with coffee or tea and that 's Economy also. I will avoid BA like the plague now, sorry but no appeal whatsoever anymore until  you become a customer focused airline once again instead of focussing on just their profits."
7.0,Flight to London  was in Business Class. The service  from the cabin crew was less  friendly and organised than the outbound flight. British Airways  had a Boeing  737 plane rather  then the 747 used on the outward journey. This meant there was  an upper deck ! The seats are comfortable and  easy to flat !. Both journeys provided a welcome  bar and 3 course menu. I  found I was  not hungry after  the meal so made use of  some snacks available  at the bar.  I used the  staff lounge at  Birmingham which was great to have a shower and some breakfast.
4.0,"Flew London Gatwick to Cancun in  business class on  an B777 that  is in need of a major refurbishment. The cabin was drab and dated; the entertainment  centre was small and the choice limited; the food was, for business class, not particularly good quality and poorly presented -  in particular the second meal (on an 11 hour  trip was a packet of sandwiches  with some cake.  i am quite capable of opening  my own packet of sandwiches but given the price  for flying business class I'd have thought BA could  make some effort  to present the  meals better. In summary the experience compared very badly  to Asian or Middle Eastern airlines I've used."
3.0,"Our latest British Airways trip from  UK Heathrow to  the Fort Worth  Airport confirms how standards are slipping.  A family living  outside USA =  2 leisure transatlantic  trip in the last 10 years ; booking for  two travellers on each trip, regularly flying Business for  one transatlantic leg.  The date transatlantic travel (over 30 years) has been  managed with British  Customer Service has  proven almost consistently good or very good. We may  only be Gold or Silver members, but we don't  like the shoddy treatment this most  recently booking received. 1) Original booking for outbound LHR-DFW  flights was booked  by BA agent over the phone in the wrong category/class, even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an  item (cash or ) at a later date. Subsequent  return calls over the next few months were a farce, with consistently  poor responses - when we eventually  manage to get through. The Executive Club customer service  service just sends you round in circles! A formal  phone complaint through ""Contact us"" resulted in ""we're sorry to hear you've  experienced problems"" - but no solution offered. Teeth gritted  and traveled. 2) 9.5 hour flight  was departing 1030.  Lunch served 1130ish before lunch. 9year  olds daughter hungry, no nibbles. When asked, steward responded  ""… that's cutbacks  to you"". Pre-ordered child's meal arrived  just before standard adult meals. No problem. Juice and  tea were available  throughout the afternoon. No snacks available for children for  2 hours! ""Cutbacks"". Luckily I had  a packet of  biscuits (as a gift for friends  in USA). At  - cabin service (tea) started. When  I asked for  my pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with  attendant went thus - ""Why didn't you order one?"" ""I did!"" ""She didn't have a child's meal at ..."" ""Yes, she "". ""Oh well,  just check when  she finished serving the main cabin"" Really? We were  probably in the  front or 4th row - would  there have been too much effort , check then? Clearly yes it would. And when she did check  about 20 minutes later, there was  no child's meal - so they  threw together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. No hint of  an apology. Customer service? Customer satisfaction?  And continued loyalty for transatlantic flights?  What do you think?"
2.0,"Flight to Hong Kong return. Through no fault of our own, very late-running bus, major  car accident, and a driver who threw us off in the cargo  area and told us to wait  for the next bus – my  wife and I missed our 18.30 flight to Hong Kong on December . We thought we would be re-booked on the later 20.50 flight,  particularly since we  were business class ! Instead, we  were told by the BA official  behind the misnamed ‘Customer Services’ desk that we had  somehow missed our plane (I assume that was code for ‘it’s your fault, not our ; that was certainly what his  voice conveyed). We were then offered 3 options – pay a supplement of £1478 to take the 20.50 flight, take a downgrade to Premium Economy WITHOUT a  commitment that BA would reimburse us the difference in seat price, or wait four days. The BA official couldn’t have been  as flexible or sympathetic, and BA has responded to  our complaint via  email with the same disinterest. My travel companion’s business class seat was  a gift for  my 60th birthday. Any pleasure she might have got from it, and mine in giving it to her, were ruined by  the way we were treated. On the (half-empty) flight  home on New  Year Eve the crew obviously didn’t want to be there, was barely  staffed and when my friend, a diabetic, enquired what would be in her special meal, she was told  she knew. They  really didn’t care, either. They did very grudgingly eventually agree that she  could order from the regular menu after making it clear that this was an exception and a ‘privilege’ she was being granted. I would  have thought, and expected, a little more courtesy and grace, especially in Business Class. God , how the poor souls in the back were treated. I have  switched my preference to BA for  decades in order to support my home airline. Sadly, I don’t think they deserve my custom any longer, so the next time we fly to Asia we  will take one of the Gulf airlines who at least give the impression that they want and value  your custom. BA’s only concern these days is profit at any price; their customer service is as poor as any I’ve ever come across, and their corporate  mantra ‘To Fly  To Serve’ an  ongoing joke. I’ve flown with them several times a year for the last 35 years, but I won’t be doing it again unless it <mask> possibly be <mask> The saddest thing of all is that I <mask> think British Airways will give <mask> damn."
1.0,"London Heathrow to  Dubai I've been  travelling to and from work for  over six and  five years. The only airline that takes me to  the Heathrow is British Airways. Sometimes  we fly there and back up to two times  per week. I do not eat on flights, so I thought BA's decision to charge  me food was  not gonna upset me too much. However they've managed. I always bring  our own good  hot tea and  a cup and  the crew for some hot water.  Finish my tea  to go to sleep. To my surprise I am not allowed to get hot water anymore! In fact I am not allowed to get any water on BA shorthaul flight  until I pay (even if I bring my own  water and tea) or unless it's medical emergency, then I could get  glasses of cold  beer for free. So not only  they didn't lower the fare, but  I also sucessfully joined budget airline  BA by charging even for water!  In my great  surprise they are the only airline that takes me to Heathrow so I can't take  the custom anywhere else unless I change job. But if I am to fly on holiday, British Airways  should not be my chosen carrier  once again."
8.0,"London Heathrow to Amman. It was my first time to fly the A321 (ex-BMI aircraft) in business class  at BA, and  I really like the layout that feels so spacious. The service was  smooth throughout and the cabin crew were active in  asking if passengers needed anything. The check-in queues in Amman were annoying  but other than that, this London-Amman-London  flight reminded me of how flying used to be."
8.0,"London Heathrow to  BA return, outbound  with an A320  and inbound a Boeing 767. Outbound  flight was delayed  due to engine problem just before taking off with  about 5 hours ! BA did look after us well though. Replacement aircraft found (another ) and we  soon arrived to destination. Cabin crew  are very helpful and polite. Return  to an old but still good looking B767 (I  think they will  get phased out  by 2017) which has plenty of legroom and space  in economy, although  its overhead bins  were not too  large (I guess that is the  reason they used  ot be). We  left and landed  within time. Overall , good experience despite the outbound delay but I  commend airlines that  seemed able to  take safety calls to those that would not!

"
2.0,"London Heathrow to  Paris with British  Airlines in economy ! Two hours late, and terrible  service when able  to board. The flight attendants seemed too young, and  they did not  attend to anyones concerns. I now see why, British  Columbia has lost  first class, they  really don't care about the customer.  You can honestly  state I will never fly British  Columbia again, no matter if they  are the lowest  cost carrier."
2.0,"From Gatwick to  our return. We  were appalled with the change to  our onboard meals  for both outgoing  to return flights  to Barbados. After take off we were served complimentary  drinks as usual but noted the preztals had been  slashed but wasn't  that concerned. Dinner was served shortly afterwards which I  found good although  bread and biscuits  have been cut too. The flight  itself was almost  9 hours so we were feeling hungry 4 hours  into the main  meal I was  looking forward to  the sandwich or  the least a  cookie to take the hunger off  and was completely  shocked when the cabin staff came  in with a  menu and offered us either a  medium size kit kat, a small bag of crisps  or 2 small  sandwiches The cabin  attendant told me  this was the  new policy, and that if we wanted we could buy snacks which she then told  us was in  particular a small  packet of pringles!  There were  not even any sandwiches for sale! Fortunately for us  shortly after a  lady came through  in premium economy and joined a queue for the  food and I  saw she was  holding a sandwich,  I asked her where she had got it, and  simply replied that  it had been given to her and did we  eat it!   No one advised us that there  is only one  meal in 9 hours, if so  she would have bought a sandwich  with us. I  went through the onboard magazine and  there was no list of snacks  and anything about these severe cut backs. So if your planning on travelling with British Airways economy to  Caribbean make sure  and pack a sandwich. Return flight we was prepared  although only a biscuit was given out. Will be travelling with Virgin  next time!"
3.0,"Travelled British Airways  from London to  Mal Lumpur return.  After a painful  three hour fight , I had  a window seat  with a metal  partition in the  changing room areas,  which meant my  feet were slanted to one side throughout the flight.  Upon my way back, the inflight entertainment didn't work.  With numerous attempts  of reset by  my cabin crew  it still didn't  happen for my partner and I.  Given the price of the ticket this was not  ideal"
10.0,"London to London  the entire experience was excellent, although  due to bad  weather conditions in London, my original  flight was cancelled  later I was rebooked on another one 30 hours  after BA compensated  that first night  and I got  the room upgrade and their staff  kept me informed  despite the difficult situation. The aircraft  staff was clean and smart and  their crew smiling, polite and efficient! Both flights on time and the  weather was average."
2.0,"Manchester to Los ax via Heathrow. I'm always reminded that British Airways is one of  my worst airlines  every time I fly with them. The check in  line is as  bad as they get. They have  taken my bags  to Heathrow even  knowing I'm going  into LAX. I  tell them to  double check, or at least ask where I'm going. To make things  worse the ground  then proceed to suggest that its  MY fault because  I booked two  extra tickets, which  we know for  a fact that  I didn't because  we booked a  longer flight. Staff  and attitude across - board. Poor food on long  leg flights. Struggling to think of many ways they  could be worse.  A real embarrassment  to British Airways  being my country's main airline."
1.0,"Manchester to Las alle via Manchester. I went to  great trouble of checking in online,  no boarding pass  information and expecting  the just drop my bag at  the airport, to  be told that  is not allowed!  And was told  I had no  alternative but to  join up with  someone else checking in. After 1 hour in the  airport queue, I  was told there  was ""no space for a bag  here at Manchester T3"". The agent said this with  an empty check-in  counter next to  me British Airways disgust me with  its hoop-jumping checking  process online which only serves the  airlines and left  me in agony  on my feet. Thank you for  a complimentary micro-bag  of crisps on  my delayed LHR-MAN leg! If I never see BA/AA G again it'll  come too soon.

2.0,"Welcome to London Business Class. Living  in London, and  taking international long haul flights throughout  the year I have once again  been disappointed by British Airways poor  service for premium  seats in preferred . Our family of four were  travelling home from the Christmas holidays  after an overnight  trip and when  it was ready to sleep I  decided to recline  my seat in the ""flat bed position"". My seat  did not recline.  Our flight was completely full and  they were no  extra seats available  for switch me . These are  the checks a  cabin crew could and should go  over prior to  boarding an aircraft. I notified the flight attendant to  see if he  had any knowledge as to how  my seat could be adjusted in  an attempt to  change it. Sadly,  they did not.  I was informed that the head/purser was on his  own rest and  said he would come discuss the  issue with me in an hour and a half. Hopefully his accommodations  was better than  this Prior to  this (20 minutes  late on a  12 hour flight),  my purser spoke to me and  apologised on behalf  for BA and  whether he could compensate me with  only £50 or  1000 Avios. I informed him there was a far greater price point between Premium Economy  than Business Class. Understandably, he apologised and said that  was all he was capable of doing. I received  another call from a BA representative and I was  told that she could only provide  passengers with similar compensation - £50  and 10,000 Avios. (I currently have 588,500 avois on BA that is nearly impossible to ). I requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight  to Heathrow to  move from a Premium Economy seat to a Business Class seat. The  BA representative said  that she could  easily do this  as customers pay  for the Business  Class experience -  the food, individual flight attendant service and comfort. Sleeping is the entire point of purchasing  that Business Class seat - not  the food. My  flight was not ! The flight  staff on BA have always been  very professional irregardless of the cabin, the point was to sleep."
1.0,"Have flown this route (Sydney to  Perth many times  on other airlines and British Airways is the worst. They changed our  seats during the fuel stop at  JFK - without notice, without explanation.  Our food was  disgusting - no  fruit or green vegetable to be  seen Cabin staff stomp up and  up the aisle attending to premium  passengers - bumped into numerous times.  Rest locations on  board are terrible  - those poor people seated right  up to the  exit door. Paid  cash for reserved seats - no !! Inflight entertainment  was awful -  some really old movies. This airline  put on some nostalgic image as  if they were in the 1950's.  These airlines are  vastly superior. Don't  fly it -  you be disappointed."
1.0,"Flight CDG to  Frankfurt via London  - in Business  Class It was  my first flight  for BA, and  since my last  flight BA is  another perfect example what an airline  is after too much cost cutting.  My business class  first row has  four seats, never  seen that in  my recent business  flights and you  never forget any  seat The seat  is comfortable in  sitting position but  was not comfy  in bed position  and you have  an open a  little tiny seat  to put your  bag Not convenient.  My IFE screen  very tiny, smaller  compared in economy  in recent airplanes.  Overall movie selection  was very poor.  My meal was  small and quantity  is very poor.  Three tiny toilets  at the business  was not enough."
2.0,"London Heathrow to  Hong Kong was  my most disappointing  economy class experience. The bottom line  was that BA had 8 business class seats in  each row on this Boeing 777 X LHR to . The seats on BA are narrow, lack privacy  (= face of  a stranger next  door me facing in the opposite direction was about  100 feet, 60  cm from me) and don't even  talk about any storage space (I couldn't find a  good surface to  keep my eyeglasses  onto and I  left my water  bottles on the  floor under the seat). The footrest  has to be operated manually. The entire experience was so irritating that  you didn't know  whether I should  leave or just  laugh at it.  You have no idea how BA  could get away with this. They  probably won't see  me as a  passenger again."
9.0,"Toronto to London return in Club World on 787-900 with British Airways.  BA was upgraded a couple of months ago from World Traveller Plus (worth the money for a decent night's sleep). Fast check in and fast track security at Pearson meant  BA was in the lounge within 15 mins. Excellent lounge supper service with a choice of a roast  and noodles in soup. The lounge is well managed and maintained with friendly staff and a well stocked bar. On time  departure but a delayed departure due  a loading baggage. A glass of champagne, with a top up, before  boarding I always find boarding in Club World disjointed and fragmented as crew from World Traveler assist making the pre departure service erratic. A fast drinks service and supper were  delivered with lights out. A well timed late breakfast meant a decent  two hours sleep on this leg  as my food choices were actually available. Priority bags beat me to the baggage belt. The return leg was enhanced due to being upgraded 24 hours before departure. (clearly oversold for such early  departure but welcome as a BA Silver member). The flight was one of my best business class flights and reminded me of the old BA I knew  and loved. Fast bar service done by tray and not by cart, an excellent meal of roast chicken, with a delicious caramel desert (plated too) and some decent wines. The only reduction in service spotted this time was the wine list was down to two reds, two whites and no Rose. That said, the wines were very good. The cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional, friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when asked. Afternoon  meal is a now a bit of let down with the scones dropped. An early landing, and prompt bags on the belt completed a stellar trip back home. If only BA could deliver this standard consistently with an improved product and friendly crew and sort out the flawed and outdated seat layout, then there is a chance BA could return to it's former glory"
6.0,"London Heathrow to  America After my rave review of Norwegian to California, I find myself  again on British Airways on my  first trip to  Central America. No delays on departure and well ordered boarding, but despite  their smiles, British  airline staff just  cannot quite reach  out to passengers  nor was the  whole experience. Tired, grey Boeing 777 s doesn't help ? Okay the  standards of a service are there , come on,  they decided no  soft drinks served  with dinner or  even the afternoon tea with a  cup of sickly  biscuits and half  of tumbler of  milk to later  serve quite a  late lunch with  a coffee or  tea ? Pokey  touch screen but  no IFE programme choice. I suppose  it is the  best we can expect but with  the called low  fares airlines doing  not much better, the main carriers  stand to lose ?"
1.0,"On my way home on 1st January 2017 (Athens to LHR) the flight BA633 had 3 hours delayed departure. Despite the  reason this ticket costs £220 and an addition of a £20 for a seat which later came down to £8, and an astonishing 70 p for luggage the only thing  else we were  eating inflight was  the sandwich. No headphones to watch the in flight entertainment and  I had a fault on the  wall above the seats. This airline is going down , and I will be happy  to see this happening if it was not for some hardworking crew members which try to salvage the reputation of BA. I will try  never to fly them again. They are worse than Ryanair. At least with Ryanair you know what to expect. BA has the logo to fly to serve I think it should be changed:  they fly to rip off and make your lives a hell on the air."
4.0,"Chicago to Denver via London Heathrow.  The Boeing 747-400  looked very old  and the inflight  entertainment system had  very small screen with very low  brightness The movies  where quite limited. The seats were okay but compared  with seats in  other airplane they  seemed quite dated.  Space was limited  capacity for storage, both bags and  liquids in the  rear pocket. A  TV and a  drink was provided  for transatlantic flight and the food  was reasonably good.  That and all  - a bad experience - but  relative to modern  aircraft it was  also very dated  - I flown  dozens of airline  flights and this was by far the poorest experience  for cabin features,  including food and  service"
5.0,"The Heathrow to Tehran return. The  difference in staff could have been  A little more , although a  little friends and  their baggage were  helped and eventually,  due to a  friend getting an  Uber we managed  and sort it  back out.   Everyone was disappointed  at the lack  to food provided  by British Airways on this flight.  Gone are the days where you get a pack  with peanuts with  a drink early  morning in the  day The Muslim  staff was really not nice at  first and I should have stuck  with the same  as others had  it was actually  going to be very nice! I was so tired,  both outbound and  glad I found  my seats to  feel decent. Inflight entertainment was quite  decent too (did  have to ask  about a fresh set of ear phones however). British  airlines just don't seem to be  in the same league as others such as Qatar  and Emirates, Virgin etc."
5.0,"Welcome to London Gatwick with British . The worst  flight I've ever had. I was looking forward to my first flight  with British Airways  knowing that they were a leading airline. In my  opinion they are  something special. I  am looking forward  for a nice breakfast before landing back at Gatwick  from Mexico. We  got given a cheese roll, yoghurt and a cereal  bar I couldn't  have the cheese  rolls as it was so bland,  skipped the yoghurt  but saved the  cereal bar for  my 2 hour drive home. Okay,  we got a good price and  flew economy but that's exactly what  you got -  another flight that seemed to focus  on economy. I would be happy  going now on  not pay more  with another airline."

Coming back from my honeymoon, me  and my wife had our luggage  taken and is  gone over the holidays, 3 weeks  of clothes in our suitcases, and no one is able to give us answers to  where it is  or why it's missing. I can't  ever get a hold of anyone in their offices to speak to in regards to a claim? Everyone says to do it online, sure and how long is it going to take for someone to get back to me? This is not a way to  help customers. I will make sure to never fly on British Airways !"
10.0,"Having read so  many negative reviews on this site regarding British Airways  on their First Class product I  became somewhat concerned as to what  the experience would  look like on  a First Class flight from LHR-SAN on BA273 on  a B747-400, I needn't have worried,  this flight was  great on all  occasions Our domestic  direct flight from MAN-LHR was delayed by 2 hours  due to fog at LHR, the Captain  came  to the Gate  2 and explained  his reasons of  the delay and  answered questions from  our concerned passengers about their connecting  flight in LHR.  Whilst we had  over 4 hours  of our itinerary  and the delay  made us no  and passengers with  delayed connections at  home were offered alternative connection options. The Concorde Lounge in LHR T5 BA First Class  Lounge was superb  by professional and courteous staff, we  even booked a  Room and Spa , both were  excellent and highly  recommend plan time  on your itinerary to enjoy these  at the full.  The lounge offers  à la Carte  entertainment and the  service was excellentpromptly,  coffee and great  coffee were also available. Onboard the BA747 in the  Business Cabin we had seats 2A & 2K, these offered great comfort for the 11  hour flight, the seats were made  with a bed  for the cabin crew when you requested it, I got 6 hours  of good quality quilts and pillows  with this. Seats  K or 1K  may have been  much better for a couple travelling  solo as they are closer together than 2A 2K, but this is  not a negative ! The meal  experience was excellent,  especially when you  get excellent choice of aperitifs, wines  or champagne. The  BA Cabin Crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner  during the 11 hour flight. First Class seats offer  excellent privacy, probably  those seats 4EF  and 5EF offer the least privacy , therefore I would avoid these  whenever possible. BA  747 is in a league of  their own and miles ahead of Club, both in  the Air and  On the Ground! Well done BA,  that really was a First Class  flight in every  sense of the words."
7.0,"Flew London Gatwick  for Tampa with British Airways. Gatwick  was a modern airport, but check-in was slow as  were security. In the departure hall plenty of places  of eat and  you Gate shown about an hour before departure. Waited for 30-45 mins at gate as  departure was delayed  by about 20 minutes. Boarding took a very long time as it  is a full . Once on board the aircraft we departed quickly.The seats was pretty old but just  seemed comfortable enough.  While in the  plane immigration cards  are handed out followed by a drink service, but  no pretzels like BA used to do. About 2  hours after take off food was served. (chicken curry  with vegetable lasagna). Lunch was quite nice, but small. After lunch duty free was sold. Four hours into  our flight the cabin lights were turned off. The IFE was OK, there were lots  more movies and tv shows, but not many games.  Sometimes the screen went fuzzy when the moving map was on. Screen  very small but  big screen still  worked Between meals  there were snacks available, but they had to be paid for (there used to be  a free snack box). Drinks were  also avaliable and free between meals.  One hour before a sandwich, kitkat , a drink were served, the  meal was not adequate, but tasted  OK After the  flight was cleared plane stared the long descent into Tampa airport. Once we landed it  took a long walk to immigration, however the queue was short. Overall the flight was not bad. Not much food, but crew were helpful  and attentive."

After an hour into the journey, the  girls started to  fuss We tried  taking them walking with them etc but couldn't stop them. I went to the galley and requested for  a snack for my daughters and was told the  snack will be served shortly. However,  they took an hour at least to serve the  snack The twins  were crying as they didn't eat the main meal.  They went to the galley and  sat there waiting for assistance and  being ignored! Eventually  the Steward came to collect a trolley for Business class and saw me waiting and asked if he could help. I explained the situation to him and  then gave me  his packet which  included two biscuits. I thanked him and left.

10.0,"BA 869 from Budapest on 17th December was delayed by fog at Heathrow. The Captain took the trouble to broadcast a message to waiting passengers in the departure lounge. He explained, very succinctly, about the fog delay and made sure we knew there was no guarantee about take-off time. He gave passengers the choice  how to fly if the delay was going to be a problem for them. He  said we need to be onboard, ready to fly at a moment's notice, but we could be waiting 4 to 5 hours. We boarded and fortunately were away only two and a half hours late. I had never known that kind of  problem before with delays"". I would  like our appreciation to be passed on to the Captain and crew that day."
7.0,"Flying to Cape  Town via London : The short  plane legs were  long and efficient  and seat is  perfect for European  business class. The  food was good,  just didn't like  my dessert. Heathrow  in Cape Town  is old Boeing 747-400, and even  though this is  still one of  my favorite aircraft,  its business class  one was the  best one. The  cabin itself was comfortable and I  liked to be  away from other  people but no  extra space for  personal items around  the seat, not  much to watch  TV during take . There is not much to  eat anyway, and  a dirty seat  and cabin. No USB plug or  at least an  Ethernet plug but  in a UK  airline How international. The full flat  seat is good  if you are  taller than 187cm.  Emirates is the  only airline in  economy class long  distance that has  one seat in  each row. The  food was good,  but needs some  final touches though. Look at what  they are offering,  US Airways are  falling behind. The  flight crew was  helpful and friendly and it all  came down to  one attendant on  the side. She gave her all  and ensure a  comfortable flightIt is sad that legacy  flights now go  down same road as low cost , instead of  striving for better  fares"
1.0,"West Washington to  London Heathrow. Bad  weather for my  return trip on  US Airways. Extra  fees for decent  food meant nothing.  Only a mid-cabin  seat for my  husband and I.  Then delayed 4.5  hours due to  technical problem. So  for the insult  by paying for  our seats, my  daughter and I  were rebooked in  at very last  day of the  flight - no , just shoulder  shrug about it  being a different  airline This caused  us to miss  our connecting flight  in Venice, thereby  facing a 7  minute wait at  JFK Overall a  hell of a  bad day. Thinking  somehow BA would  want to atone  for royally jobbing  passengers on the  flight was wasted.  The couple of  extra cost vouchers  and small meals  were provided. A  suggestion that access  to the British  Eagle lounge would  become a class  upgrade to assuage  our delay was  greeted with a  sense of astonishment.  No real remorse,  matter of fact  just like gee,  this happens a  day and good ! No customer  service sought. Dispassionate,  helpful but not  very friendly. Staff  seemed tired and  busy at counters."
5.0,From Heathrow to Prague. As a Gold exec member  I was mortified to find out  that as a Gold member we were not allowed to choose a seat or exit seat. My seat allocation may have been in the rear toilet it was that far back. Also finding out meals are  not stopped in  Prague and you can only pay  via Avios or card this has in my opinion  brought a great name into the league of of other cheap airlines. How sad but clearly someone in charge (at the moment) is feeling  pressure and feels that is going to improve customer choice. Why do you think people  choose British Airways? As they are more expensive? Because  enjoying the service and being like it used to be to fly  while taking a picnic with you. 
7.0,"That was a  slightly better flight  from our outward  flights with British  Airlines The staff s on the  flight worked hard , always around. A nice plane,  good IFE with  nice modern screen.  Food were fine although storage lacking  due to A380.  But still a  mess . Chicken  served in kebabs  was far too  salty and soggy.  The wine good red poor. Breakfast  was eggs and  toast Spoilt by having a greasy  plate in the  back of tray rendering pretty well inedible. I got  some decent sleep."
1.0,"Fly to Toronto via London, and I tried to check-in online. However, this was blocked and upon enquiry to BA’s unhelpful Customer Contact centre, I was told it was a  bogus security hold by airport authorities.  So I questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of  my ETA for  Canada to Canada.  When I informed  that that could not be the case as I  was a dual UK-Canadian citizen, she  amended the story to one of it being ascribed  from the company but that it could not be  correct because of the website. Only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my  Canadian passport details and lift the block previously described  was out of BA’s control. The second joy I had with lovely  customers and staff  arrived at Heathrow  is transit. As  I had a 6-hour layover I elected not to go to transit and to meet  my parents instead at T5 arrivals. Upon entering departures, I was stopped by one of BA senior managers who forced me to check in my carry-on luggage (despite it being cleared by BA in Dubai) but  was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through. Perhaps she is the model random manager BA aspires to for future ? In any case, this “manager”  was so eager  to check by  carry on in, that she left  the whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check-in agents . Such is  sheer competency and class of this “manager” but then again one can expect no less from BA either. Finally, at Toronto, the checked in carry on came half-hour after the already delayed regular checked-in luggage – adding salt to wound. I flew  to London from  Canada several times last year on Emirates, and on KLM/Delta/Air France to Toronto at multiple  other times and never had any issues with security or carry-on from any of them. Finally, I called the UK ""Customer Relations"" center from Toronto, but I  wound up about  being put on hold for almost 7 minutes. They are incompetent and  incompetent in that field too. I wish I could give this rotten airline 0/10, but the minimum is  OK and I am happy with  BA"
1.0,"From Heathrow to Copenhagen. After many horrible experiences on BA, I am convinced this airline  holds total contempt  Not only for its customers but  even for top tier elite frequent  flyers I am  a Executive Platinum  and I am  often treated worse  by cattle - forced to check  the carry-on bag which is within  my BA limits  at multiple occasions, denied boarding, zero  refund policy, zero  refund when being forcefully re-booked (recently I had to  pay £300 in  addition to an  incredibly expensive £400 ticket for a 2 hr EU  trip I live  in London and I'm a loyal  British Airlines frequent  flyer clocking around 200,000 miles a  month I will  fly British Airways even if it 's an extra connection, flying a low cost carrier  is not flying  them all."
2.0,London Gatwick to  your return. The charge to reserve your seat is extortionate The check in staff at Gatwick were miserable to the point  of rudeness. The inflight meal was  disgusting and the pre arrival meal/snack was a joke. British Airways is  owned by bean counters who want to charge / extricate the maximum amount of money  with the minimum expenditure. No wonder  British Airways are slipping down the  priority lists.
2.0,"Fly to Belfast  from London Heathrow.  My last two  flights on British  flights have been a nightmare. The  previous flight, BA informed me at  the airport I  not longer had  my ticket, as  they had oversold  my flight. They  then explained I 'd have a free hotel stay,  and if I 'd won a prize. I avoided  them for months  on that one. Then I slipped  right into a  bad habit and  contacted them again  for a work trip to Ukraine. On the return  flight they asked me if I  would like to cancel my connecting flight and rebook  mine for the next day, as  my outbound plane  was delayed. I said no thank  you as my BA connecting flight was delayed by  the same amount. I arrived 90 minutes prior to  taking off for the connection (all in the same ), suddenly the  boarding pass on  their phone disappeared  and was replaced with a ticket for 9.45am the  same day. They ground staff explained they had cancelled  my ticket as they thought I would not make . Here I am is my reply. 'Sorry sir, the plane is  already closed'. 'So you sold my  ticket on'. 'No , but the  airport is closed'. 'It cant be , there is  plenty of time'. 'Yes, but there  is no seats'.  BA debated the point. 'I wouldn't  debate the point , a lot  if people have  been pushed off flights today, and  hotels in London  is being booked out, if I  was you I  can jump on  the internet and  book accommodation'. Because  Of course it was now my problem to find  my hotel room  outside London (BA cover rooms up  until £200, fine, though if you  have kids they give you a mere £12.50 to  buy breakfast, lunch  or dinner for  the child - in London, good luck). Get a  room arrive back at the airport  early next day, wait in line  another 2 hours  ( I arrived 3 hours early  on domestic flight),  go to the  check in desk. Guess what, I  am booked on the flight but  its appears my seat has been  sold away. Again, of course, its  my problem. 'Go  to the special  services desk sir'.  On that desk they tell me it could be  today I get  lucky it could be tomorrow, but  is hard to say, given the  time period. But  all in super surly tone, and  he was clear  I was all  my fault. 'You can try another  flight sir but they are all  sold out' (at this stage I began checking car  ferry and ferry . Absolutely disgusting ! Every other  airline I have <mask> with, in <mask> type of <mask> booked me <mask> hotel, and had a bus <mask> or a <mask> with a <mask> boarding pass <mask> the next <mask> Its a shame, as the <mask> crew and <mask> seem top <mask> A team that is utterly <mask> down by <mask> with their <mask> organisation and <mask> customer care policies. So I would love to fly BA for the crew and <mask> but given <mask> utterly terrible customer care, its <mask> not worth it."
9.0,"London Heathrow to  Cape Town in  Manchester Food was  good as was  customer service with very friendly cabin  crew I think some people expect  so much on aircraft, airlines are cutting back. Flights left on time. Not sure what  might happen when British Airways start to charge for  food and drinks on European flights  next January, not  that this will  be a good  thing"
1.0,"Bangkok to Manchester  and London. I  started to fly BA on this route on a  trial basis 10 years ago and  was impressed with  its whole offering.  Until recently we've  switched using Emirates  and Etihad. We  use the route  two or three times a year to visit family.  They were offering a good price on their Premium  Economy seats so  we switched. What  the big mistake. Never, ever again. Despite paying a  great price you  can only book your seat within  12 hours of  departure unless you  want a £40 - £50 surcharge.  Having to pay we had some anxious moments worrying  where we would sit together. In the end it  went OK but we can't get over the cheek of charging to  reserve a seat - Emirates and Etihad don't charge. The seats themselves  are very old  but uncomfortable. Leg room was OK  however the seats  felt very narrow. Nothing like the comfort of Emirates  and Etihad in Economy. Inflight entertainment  was on a post card size  TV with a  small screen that  looked very inconsistent. Picture quality was  like watching a TV in the  cabin Food was : Little choice,  cold starters and mains swimming in water. Other than an initial drinks run and obviously  the food service  the rest of  cabin service was . If you  had extra drinks or service including  food the only  choice was to  visit the galley at the back of the plane. Cabin crew were surly and generally  rude The plane was old and the cabins were  worn and threadbare in places. Certainly on this route BA have not invested in their fleet and are a decade behind  UAE and Etihad when it comes to comfort and service."
3.0,"The return flight  into St Lucia  started well. To my surprise the Business Class lounge for 1st and Club customers at  this airport was a pleasant shared lounge and the  US Airways flight  were the only  ones leaving at this hour. It  looked very nice - considerably better than the dive at Antigua. It  was light and  had very comfortable seats and some decent snacks and a well equipped bar. We enjoyed  the stay there. It was some trek to the plane. As I  entered the front  cabin door and made my way to seat 1A a lady FA As grabbed me and snatched at my boarding pass - ""we have  not see it,""  she said sharply, ""its a security process."" I was  startled at the  ladies tone as  though I was trying to sneak  onto the plane. Very strange as I had passed  my boarding pass  twice anyway. Pre flight drinks was  my usual lukewarm . Plane left on time to the minute. There were five empty  bins in 1st.  Having found my miserable looking, ever thinning pillow (they get smaller with  each flight to save money) and  went looking to  quickly find another. Can you believe ? Five empty ! Four empty  empty bins. One  more pillow in the fifth bin!  Which I grabbed). Even with two - on lie  down I had  barely any head . My wife asked for a 2nd pillow. ""Sorry madam we have  one to spare.""  I started with  a Salad and smoked trout. It  was alright. Cream of broccoli soup  was alright. Balsamic  vinegar glazed chicken for mains was a disaster. Dried  - Unedible. FAs  took up my  seat It was  hard as rock and very uncomfortable.  I slept not  for one minute.  Nor did my  husband Nor did the lady in  my adjacent seat.  I flew the  flight in 1st, last spring to  Dubai and slept for 5 hours , but it was far more softer to sleep on. I can only surmise the  seat about five years old -  was worn out. (The side areas were also very grubby). We both embarked totally shattered.  The plane generally was very tired. Worn carpets that  really should be replaced. The usual cheap amenities bag ed off the usual poor experience  of BA 1st . The IFE  looked very dated. One wonders if the BA board  will think of flying with an Asian or Middle Eastern carrier to  learn what true 1st Class should  look like. FAs , apart from the rude one - were great. The landing at  Southampton was by a highly skilled  man - and  over 35 years <mask> travel the <mask> touchdown I <mask> recall."
6.0,"London to Edinburgh return. Check in at T5 quick was able to use the fast track and Galleries North lounge due  a frequent flier status, quick security spent an hour in the lounge  with good food  in offer. Boarding onto a new looking A320 seat , with an empty seat next  door me, departed 10 min late  and otherwise a quick 1 hr flight staffed by  very decent crew who served a  meal and drink  of choice. Landed about 10 minutes late but bags  loaded quickly. Return check in again very quick but  was pretty long, used the BA lounge at EDI  that is quiet  with a few food and drink options, boarded throu ng 11 seat 4F on a pretty old Boeing  737 which was full. Departed on time for a flight of 1hr 45min so landed about 20 min late, service okay  along with a snack and drink . Okay experience I use BA  domestically and in business clas around Europe because Heathrow is convenient to where I live and to sustain my Executive Club (Oneworld) status, however there are negatives in the fees  and credit card booking fee that  airlines charge which I hate! Additionally  you see they are trying to cut costs further by charging for  seats in economy on Domestic/European flights  this puts them  below bracket. I covered 38 flights this year in all classes and while I will continue to use BA in UK/Europe. However this year I've realised there  are far cheaper  & far better options for long haul within the  Airbus alliance."
9.0,From Heathrow to  King Kong. We 've not flown  long haul with  the Airwaves for  several years. This  service was a . Staff attentive  but good. Aircraft  is spotless. Food  service excellent. We  did not recognise the product. We  got a very  comfortable sleep on  this flight. The  double bed is  probably one of  our best despite  its strange layout.  Would recommend.
2.0,"Hello from Heathrow , Buenos Aires.  I haven't flown British Airways for  almost 10 years, and with work  i usually fly  the middle-eastern or  western airlines, what a contrast! I  wonder BA have  done anything in that aircraft in the 10 years since I last flew. The TV  screen is just  very low resolution with a very small number of ok films available,  nothing of interest  to the music either. Food was  quite tasty but small portion, no side salad. Drinks  ( than water)  and only offered at meal times.  They are so narrow - I paid extra for  an emergency seat ($85!) after reading  what narrow the seats were, a wise decision, but  we shouldn't be paying extra as  other middle-east and  northern airlines I have flown have bigger seats, better  seat choice, better entertainment - how  come they offer such a poor service?"
7.0,"Hong Kong to London. First time  in long haul on British Airways.  Air rest does not fully go  away and I  have an empty seat next to . Food was  good - especially the dinner. A  big chicken chunk with some vegetables and potatos. Leg room was terrible and minimal for an aisle seat , cramped. Inflight  music was a bore - too  many adult music , rock /  pop / jazz. Some staff were  extremely polite and pleasant while 2  of 3 were grumpy and seemed to not want  to be working , dragging their feet. CSL was  there and another  female attendant working  in first cabin , world traveler  in the main  thing when I  would not sleep and went to the galley to  eat Lack of snack choices which was poor, how many lemon cookies can you eat?  Have to love that they do  3 rounds of drink service as Singapore Airlines never  offers this for a 12 hour flight or more."
3.0,"Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok with  British Airways in premium economy, in an old tired plane. The tray  light didn't work , fact broken, and the screen was dirty, the colour was going. White wine was warm, starter was  some strange red  wine in mayonnaise, dreadful. Main was  the good piece of beef with  green veg, then what appeared to  like a piece  of cake. The staff then disappeared. The trays weren't  even cleared for an hour. When I went to  go back for  a drink all  four staff were  still having a  chat besieged by  customers wanting things.  They had lost  the grip of  their service. In economy people were working round the uncleared food trays. The breakfast was  much better than  usual but no  bread just awful Danish pastry. Poor,  because of what  the economy costs."
4.0,"Disappointed. Almost all other airlines will have same or better leg room, definitely better meals and cost a  little less, so don't choose British Airways unless you are getting a good deal. No choice of meals (only veg or  no veg) and the quality and quantity was extremely poor. They don't even contain any salad. No snacks with the drinks. Delhi - London was approx 10 hrs, but served only one meal. Was informed by the steward that only veg meals left and the meal was just  served without even bothering to ask us, if we would like to have it. Same on the leg  between London to  US DC. Not that it mattered because the meals  were not at all good. To top it all, my luggage did not arrive on return to Washington DC."
1.0," British Airways was  supposed to be  a quality airline , that does  not apply any longer. My first  flying experience earlier  this year was  just be told  how my seat  has been sold  because they could  still take me  and I had  a wait for  three hours in  an airport and  they did not  yet have the  time to give  passengers a lounge  pass so I  just wait having a refreshment. But  by 10th December  is just not  enough and my  last trip with  them I had  two flights lined  between San Diego  to Seville, all  being operated with British Airways. Their  last plane was  delayed by two hours. By the time we arrived  at London I  already lost my  connecting flight. They  said I was  on my own  but I booked  in separately so  then had to  get new tickets  to pay for  their own stay overnight. Their behaviour  is one of a cheap airline that cannot be  depended on and in case of  emergency does not  want you to  fly to your  destination"
1.0,"London to Philadelphia.  I paid for the premium economy  seat and the Flight Attendant would not allow us to recline the seat back because  the people behind us were complaining. That was not  the problem and we did not get what we paid for, full comfort of the  seats I have  reached out to British Airways several times to no . In fact  at one time the British airways rep told me to falsify a travel insurance claim to get my money back. "
5.0,"- Ft Worth  and Mumbai via  US Heathrow after  a reroute due  to Lufthansa strike. Overall British Airways  first class product  is not up to par with  airlines and feels like a premium economy experience. Ground  transfers at DFW were OK though  there was no agent in the  gate till about  2 hours before . On board the seat if flat, but very narrow. Food was awful and felt  as an economy class meal served  with china; no  presentation and was  mediocre at best.  Crew on both flights were fairly mediocre - just  walked through the  window but didn't  seem particularly interested in passenger service  over all.The second  flight on LHR-BOM was the worst  food I have  experienced on an airplane - literally  one deep fried potato and thats . Lounge at  BA was unimpressive and overly crowded  with minimal food selection- sad display  in their main hub. Overall I would not fly  with BA by choice given their mediocre product. The still have 8 % across in  seats compared with  6 on AF,  GA and UA."
4.0,"Flew from LHR to AUS. British  Airways Club World  seats are barely wider than coach,  but the curvature  in the shell  making it feel tighter in the shoulders than coach  with the seat  width almost half . Profoundly uncomfortable when fully flat  as there is  one hard bulge  on the hinge,  making sleeping position  uncomfortable with head rest a few  times Could barely wedge myself into the window seat  in unrestricted aisle , couldn't get  rid of the  window without putting  one hand on  and pulling down  my seat divider.  And that makes  a lower part of flat bed  get unhooked and dropped to the  side four times  in preceding flight.  Seat is new  with great windows.  But a bit  pricey compared to  Airbus 330. Flight crew was fine, meal service was adequate, wines were good, in-flight kitchen  has been cut  off to almost . My upgrade  was heavily discounted , I would  still pay full  price for Club  World"
8.0,"Flying to Hong  Kong in business class. Having chosen the 'best seat'  (* is important),  having had a  pleasant flight onboard  an A380 Upper . Service is  smooth but unexceptional,  noisy but no  bad as is . If on A380 with my chosen seat, this  will be my preferred flight between  Dubai and HKG.  I take numerous  trips on this  flight in Business class."
1.0,"Return to Heathrow connecting onto Virgin Atlantic to Shanghai. I arrived at Manchester terminal 3 at 08:00 and checked in to my booked flights. My outbound transfer  flight BA1389 was delayed by over 3 hours (schedule 09:55, actual 13:10). At Manchester airport, the BA service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customers. After a 2 hour queue,  BA refused to help me re-book any flights to Shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the Heathrow BA service desk. I boarded the late flight to Manchester, hoping that BA Heathrow could help me with the connecting Virgin Atlantic flight when I arrived at Heathrow. This delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to Shanghai. My flight landed over 3 hours late in terminal 5 (Schedule 11:05, actual 14:06). Upon arrival at  BA (14:30), I proceeded to go to the BA service desk at Terminal 5 to  find the next flights to Shanghai. After a 1 hour wait in the queue, the BA service personnel were not only unhelpful, but were extremely rude and aggressive towards me. They refused to help me book another flight to Shanghai, they refused to book me  onto a flight back to Manchester, they refused to help me retrieve my luggage, they  declined to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the £1814.60 air fare.  They explained that I was now stranded in Heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and  only my luggage, but they simply told me to leave the terminal  as they would not be helping  me any further.  After I pleaded  for the BA staff to move my return BA flight back to Manchester forwards to allow me to  get home, the BA personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that I was no longer blocking other customers. At no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation  which I was in.  I  was left outside  airport 5 with no transport, no accommodation and no  luggage Eventually, after asking several helpful members of airport staff, I retrieved  my luggage from  Terminal 2. I  find myself a hotel in Heathrow at 20:00 after an exhausting 12 hours and now need to figure out how to get home."
10.0,"I return in  Business Traveller Plus.  Very enjoyable flights  change ways with first-rate leg-room (38in in WTP vs  36 in regular ) remains a strong positive point  with me), some  of the best  local cuisine I've had in recent years, an excellent  onboard drinks service  at Tribute Cornish  for on-time departure/arrival , the attentive,  knowledgeable cabin-crew service  we received through  many years from  UK Airways. (Two  disappointing flyspecks though , no more  turbulence on boarding ; no nibbles  in the drinks  - but nowhere  near enough to  change the overall trip.) This remains  our favourite way  to flying between  continental USA and  Europe I am  a regular Skytrax reader and note  that numerous negative  comments BA's regular  Economy service has  been received in  my forum (haven't flown it myself  for a couple  of years though),  so on this  two other recent  occasions BA's World  Class Plus premium economy remains as  good as ever.

3.0,"Fly Club World from Chengdu to  Bangkok last week, my first time  on BA long haul for a  dozen years. How they manage to  sustain their reputation  remains a complete mystery, with the onboard product being  simply awful -  and this on a newer Boeing 787 plane! The  seating was tatty  and tables loose,  even with seat recline mechanism, IFE  uncomfortable and slow. The food was not even to economy standards, and the lack of  alcohol in the lunch demonstrates pitiful  money saving. Amenity kit second rate, the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish, and  although the flight  being quite empty  for business, the service seemed to  take on a  low Staff (when  we appeared in  the cabin) were  extremely friendly, but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the  poor facilities that  BA now provide.  We will go  on to using my preferred Asian  airline and I can only assume  that BA ""loyals"" will also start  changing as the  airlines seem intent  upon driving BA  back to low cost airline levels."
2.0,"Appalling food, especially on the Orlando-Gatwick return leg. Choice of a horrible-smelling  salad and a vegetarian pasta, the pasta was as if it had  been boiled for an hour and the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a chemical factory. There was a roll  but no butter, instead a tiny pot of 'spread' that was whipped up to give it bulk and which virtually disappeared in your mouth the moment it entered. For 'breakfast' we were given a tough bagel with a filling of cream cheese that was probably only a few  inches thick. No  butter etc. The attitude of the flight attendant was  extremely disinterested and unhelpful when I asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served. The amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of would have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable. The flight attendant suggested that I should recline my seat as  normal and couldn't understand when I refused to do this on account of it making  her a complete hypocrite. Eventually the  person in front of me must  of got the  message because she put her seat  down off her own bat. I felt very sad  that my national  airline of British Airways has lowered  itself to these standards of food and customer service. The seat was OK but nothing to write home about."
6.0,"Left Heathrow to  JFK on a  single ticket in  the economy. Boarding and departure both . A few  extra seats in  a separate cabin  but that contributed  to a relaxed flight. Service was  good to the  level of ""we  dont really care"".  But acceptable - just. IFE adequate. Seat became uncomfortable  for the last 3 or 4  hours of the  journey"
9.0,"On to Heathrow,  back to the  catch up with  no boarding and impressive that a  shuttle service is  still in. Unfortunately , again for  this same time  or the duration  of the flight,  gates to gate . Otherwise this is a great  and short hop."
9.0,Flying to Manchester. Short hop of  about 35mins in  fresh air unfortunately delayed by about the same amount of time due  a someone not  having Done this  quite a number of times and  thanks to the  fact they manage  they get a trolley service in  the landing. Alcoholic  transport is free  this is something  but this isn't  always case even  with 6hr trans-American flights.
2.0," I have been  one loyal BA  premium flyer for  almost decade but with their recent  changes this might  soon change. On my recent long  haul flight to Nairobi from London,  I was shocked  by find that  a usual tray  with snacks available through the flight  is no longer  available for free ; like some  large budget short haul airline, you have to pay.  Also unlike a budget airline, BA  rates remain higher than most. I returned from Nairobi  on premium economy - yet instead  not getting something  worth the substantial extra fare I paid to be  a premium, breakfast  consisted of 1 p - literally  one muffin only , no juice, no fruit, no . It is  utter disgrace and  insult to customers  that have, as  I have always  been accepted the  higher fares for  good service. Even the flight attendants  seem embarrassed with  their new bare bones regime. It 's no fun  to them to  still be charging  for token treats  that have always  provided free. Note , BA never  reduced fares when  they price of oil halved, making  these current cutbacks  look pure avarice. Disrespecting and providing  poor service to  your loyal customers  while charging a premium is not a winning formula.  And I wouldn't blame your invariably  rude flight attendants  travelling elsewhere where they will be  badly treated. The  final insult was  a response I  had when I  posted my above complaints. I was  reminded that extensive customer research showed  they wanted to  get charged for  their free snacks and preferred getting  a muffin instead of the usual  one - while  paying the same ! Which as is apparent to  me a complete  joke and insult  is injury. I  will flying again next week LON  from NYC and hope, not optimistically,  nothing better. "
7.0,"Welcome to London Heathrow. The British Airways Lounge at Seattle is very poor for starters,  the old lounge seats which are  old and give  an impression it's  like the 1990's. Plane was half full as it 's Thanksgiving Day so that made for a nice  relaxing flight. No real complaints as the seats in business class are  nice and comfortable  while sleeping although  my meal quality left a little to be desired. Woke just over  one hour before  departure and was  given a bowl of cereal. No juice, fruit etc.  I had to  ask for the  breakfast dish which the crew seemed  unwilling to provide,  and when they did was just  food to me,  not anything else.  Sadly this ticket was on miles.  Value for money  shown below is  calculated on basis that it was  an revenue ticket."
2.0,"Flight from LGW  to St Lucia got off to  another puzzling start  with check in.  The priority tags  appeared and I  had to ask  about them. (I  did not have  to as the  passengers came off  my plane last .) The BA 1st Class lounge  - ""still closed""  undergoing refurbishment. (I  don not think  we have any  plans of re-opening  the lounge at ) The No  1 alternative is  Fully Boarded and  easy to seat.  Both floors had  just been hoovered  by the inbound  plane All scruffy.  We took off  in time to  a minute. FAs throughout were fine , but no  email address by  far Seats look  a little ""old""  and I suspect  my plane was  some of the  last to have  the ""new"" 1st . The IFE  was certainly dated.  Dinner was ""sort o okay."" No  La Bouche"" anymore  did BA want  to cut further ? Had to settle for some  plain peanuts. They 've run out  all the premium  ones - I  believe they only  have two bottles  a board. Crab  salad was alright  - nothing special. The usual butternut  shell soup. This  being my 5th  Business Class flight  that year and  the 5th identical  - I suppose  its too much  people expect a  nice clam chowder  and lobster bisque from the bean  counters at BA HQ. Main course  the sole was  bland and tasteless.  Chips were fine  but for once , chilled. Another  pleasant experience from  Australia - but  to be honest  this time you  are used to  a ""business class""  as in BA  Business Class. I  noticed when I  bought my seats,  as there was  no unsold seats  two days before  my flight and  in one way  ticket was a  whopping £4500. The  plane was full  however and if  I paid £4500  on this -  that would be  in despair. I  have asked recently  to fly BA  Economy Class at  - Its down  200 cubic meters  in space. -  And that's it.  Another alternative is  a Business Class  or Club World  but that is an industry joke  with the ying ling seats. Off  to Perth in  late Spring and  Melbourne First. Guess  whom we are  now flying with."

I had to  stand upright for 11+hours and my  son had to sit partially reclined  to eat his meals. I had veggie meal which was served half  time before everyone else - no  food until everyone else served. Choice  in meal for husband was chicken curry or chicken curry. He doesn't like curry so it was whispered to him that he could have a veggie meal.  Dinner at breakfast - served half hour early so had to eat alone. When other  people came out, guess what no meat. On complaining to BA Customer Services, told could  get another meal if we had gone on line and paid extra. Been offered the insulting and derisory  sum of £20 off our next flight (as if there will be a next flight) - not even offered a refund  of payment we made for booking broken seat. Both airline and customer service disgraceful."
7.0,"British Airways crew  going out from  the Heathrow to  Toronto were very  friendly and enthusiastic.  We were also  very good fun,  which makes life  more pleasant up in the sky. We do this  trip every 6  weeks on our  way to visit family in Canada.  It was good,  although like other reviewers we've noticed  small changes which make things not  feel so special.  For instance, the wine is not  as pleasant as  they used to be, and there  used to be  a choice of  2 types of  wine or white.  Some of our fellow passengers said  we could have  lived with a  bit more food. So take some  snacks with you  until the wee  small hours. On the return journey,  their dinner was  good but they  are out of  stock in premium economy, and there were only 6  of us. We  are given food from business, but  everything was served on a freezing  thin plate, and  really lacked finesse. I know this  was only premium  class but there  was good standards , few years back. The breakfast before landing at  BA was horrible, a bagel, with  no cream cheese  in it and some tooth breaking  chocolate bars. I must write and  apologise to BA  on their breakfasts,  I have done  it once, with  no effect. I will try again. The staff were  quite efficient and  I felt safe,  and there were  frequent drinks runs,  so like many  passengers who travel regularly with BA,  we were a  tad disappointed, and  wish that they 'd be kind  and to listen  from their loyal customers of many ."
1.0,"- There is  something good to  like about this  bus - People with 3 pieces  or hand luggage  are allowed to  fly Business Class  - pitch is : there is  not space to  board Catering at  about 15.30 hrs  there was a  table with 3  cheese sandwiches, that was it for  the 2 hour and 10 minute flight in Business  Class Moving map  did not work.  Bus parked far  back from the  plane amongst cargo  and bus only  stopped once all  passengers had disembarked.  Low priority Business  Class bus. Altogether  a terrible experience.  Going forward: TAP - you have  a business."
4.0,"From Heathrow to Hong Kong with  British Airways on  an A380. I  actually had more  room / seatspace on a 2 hour holiday charter  plane to Spain.  I know why  I had to  take such a  cramped position for  3 hrs. Then  on top it all, i'm sorry sir we havent got any breakfast ! Not a  single chappie. Return  to same cramped  position For a  short haul flight  you would not  blame BA."
1.0,"Private Airways from  London to Bangkok : If you are thinking about  taking British Airways  to Bangkok. Don't do it. Thai Airways or Eva  Airlines for the  same price offer a much better  deal (for direct flights). If you want the best go with Emirates , it's a  fly over flight.  We fly this  airline 20 times  every year. Here  are the key  reason why you  do not fly with British Airways.  On my experience I believe they  make flights so  they are always full which increases  the risk of  feeling uncomfortable and  uncomfortable flying. The aircraft are very  old If you ask for a  sandwich during the flight the staff love to tell you 'Can you wait? service is  in 20 mins' this has been tested a few times. They hate anyone who asks  for a snack because it starts  a chain reaction  with other customers.  Your next service  will be in 1 hour but  they will still tell you 20 mins. Entertainment is terrible and old and you will  also keep accidentally  hitting the service button and light with your arm.  NO phone charger , no USB . No Wifi. Seats are very old, very uncomfortable"
8.0,"Great service flying from London to  very attentive crew and acceptable breakfast on outbound leg and meal on return leg. Outbound  legs the crew  was pleasant and efficient. On the  returning leg the  passengers were one  if the most  friendly and approachable  i have met on a BA  flight in quite  some time. Food  at a shorthaul  restaurant was very good and drinks including champagne regularly , The only  complaint I have is that unless you are a  First World Emerald card holder you can't select your seat at the  point of booking unless you pay  the per person  per sector. I  believe it's a  US Airways thing.  In the LCCs  can you book your seat for  a reasonable cost.  On business class  flights I expect  I get seat  choice as a  result regardless of  class status. I  feel this policy  is misguided and  we will take  it into consideration in booking future  flights"
1.0,"Singapore to Sydney in business class.  Our price was lowish so we booked—never again. Seat comfort was almost non-existent with appalling . The in-flight service hit a  new low for  an absolutely shambolic, no team effort, aloof hostesses were  downright dismissive of passengers. Food and  drink were cut-price  and worsened by  bad wine and . No water offered and meal  was forgotten. Entertainment choices were sub-par. No noise-cancelling headphones. No cosmetics in  those dirty toilets.  One dollar-shop amenity bag. I have  experienced better economy  airlines than this sector. Shame on  you British Airways. </s>"
1.0,"Hong Kong to London, seats 22K and 22J. It  was one of the worst journeys we have ever had to entail. My other half who is 6'3"" was locked into a paralysed position for 13 hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for 90%  on the flight. The small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfort. He couldn't even watch the  onboard entertainment as there was barely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined. As a shorter  Asian person at 5'4"", I was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flight. Placed in the middle, I barely had any where to put myself, seats  being so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me  is of slight build. My headphone socket was crackling , the film  I wanted to watch, Cleopatra, (with the desperate hope  of killing 4 hours of time) wasn't working, it was just a black screen with audio. After travelling long haul last  year to Tokyo with another European airline, I could clearly detect a  huge difference with the way economy  passengers are treated on BA. Within 10 minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and  packets of pretzels to customers. On  others we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered  any drink. On this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellers. Would much rather pay more and travel with another airline than  travel with BA long haul ever again."
6.0,"A good flight  from Heathrow to Stockholm. Busy and  slow boarding as  people board by row number. Therefore  it took forever , with an  error of hand  and flight was  running late. On board meal now  a bag of  chips or biscuits but I know  even by January even that will have gone, thereby relegating BA to  a low cost airline. Not surprised  thank you, as they have to compete with the others, but BA  will need to keep their prices ! Female crew were as friendly  at ever. Males less so."
3.0,"London Heathrow to Zurich return using their business class. Online check in and easy access through security at Heathrow. Lounge was overcrowded and not much better than using a coffee shop in the main terminal. Seats onboard A321 are a joke for  business class with very small legroom / seat pitch. Food also shows reals signs of cost reduction, and  it is very much closer to low-cost carriers than airlines like Lufthansa or Swiss. Staff service was best described as ""perfunctory""  – they provide F&B and then rest of the flight in the galley chatting very loudly about their Christmas plans. Return flight no different, except that cabin staff did manage to say hello as we boarded flight. BA has become a very expensive and disappointing  airline to fly."
3.0,"What a disappointing experience flying British Airways from London Gatwick to Mauritius. Flew club class and the service was merely adequate, they did what  they had to do and no more - at no point we were made to feel valued customers. A request for a cup of tea after dinner, resulted in no tea brought (it was allegedly given  with another passenger), when we had fruit as a dessert, it was given with no plate, bread at breakfast was also given without a plate - had to be put directly onto the tray. On the flight out the  following film releases  were in the onboard flight magazine,  were available to view. Given that we paid a  bit of money for these tickets, the service given was very poor  with the flight attendants not overly friendly. BA now seems to be a budget airline with regard to service and amenities but premium in price. Flew Emirates last year to Mauritius and there is no comparison. Emirates wins hands down. BA needs to get its act together as it will loose customers."
1.0,"Double disgrace. They cancelled my flight  an hour and 45 minutes before the the flight  and put me on the next  flight with 3 hours 15 minutes . I do have VIP access to the lounges,  and non of  their lounges in  Britain accepts my  BA access card/company.  After I asked the BA staff and managers to  request access they  just gave me  this insulting £5  piece of voucher.  Surely they can do better than  that It probably  doesnt mean anything  to BA, but I am not  a happy customer.

1.0,"Bassinets by British  airlines cater for newborn only. My 10 month old son could not fit in it. The only option was a child seat, however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat. The only option is to sleep on you. However the arm rests are fixed in and hard. Couple that with the need to breast feed your child, with his poor head and  neck crammed in between the seat, either his head would get banged on the armrest or he'd kick the armrest at the other end. It was not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from London to Hong Kong. Other airlines offer bassinets up to one , some even 2 years and  they have arm rests that see moveable so that your child is not so constrained in a tiny space for long hours. Imagine a 13 hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he can't fit in the  chair And every so often you fear he'll fall off your lap. To travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and British airways refuse to do anything about it."
9.0,"Security at Singapore  Airlines is carried  on in a  private area away from the desks  so it was done quickly, efficiently  and enables you  easily bypass the  line to enter  a terminal. Boarding  became chaotic. After  greeting families with  both first and club passengers, and  boarding the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance. As before, the cabin crew  was professional, helpful and enthusiastic. Dinner  was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening . It seems  to shame that in its desire  to cut costs,  British Airways uses  forks and napkins  that seem a little too thin and the cutlery  is slightly too  small Nevertheless, the  dinner was tasty  and cooked properly , there was  also good selection of wine and  beer After a  round of glasses  of port they made my bed  which I slept  on for several  days The seat  was equipped with  four USB ports but these put  out such little  pressure by iPhone  taking a long  way to charge and they could  hardly handle an iPad. We landed at Heathrow on  schedule and reached  gate 5 within  a matter of  hours One of British Airways’ greatest  assets is its  ground crew who,  by my experience, are considerably better  then their rivals.  All the airline  needs to do  something to stop  trying to save money and start  providing its premium  class passengers those little extras that  we have become accustomed to on  other airlines. It  may have been  a one-off but  management also needs  to ensure that  everything is carried  about properly."
8.0,"New York JFK to London. Pleasantly  glad to have  had a nice flight on BA.  While the aircraft  was relatively old, the seats were comfortable with a  decent seat width  / pitch. I  received a rude shock when I was told I  needed to be seated in the middle seat of the middle row but it turned  up alright. The  problem with BA  were that we  needed to purchase  the seat if  they wanted a  second seat. It  was their way  of ancillary income.  Their IFE can be improved as  BA have very  few offerings. Cabin  attendants were extremely friendly and attentive.  We were tested  as we had  an ill passenger  worth taxiing for ! They showed  up and were  helpful in their  new

7.0,"London Heathrow to  Manchester City. A  very good flight,  started on time, crew smiled and  looked like they 're having fun.  Nice full cooked  continental breakfast which  were served with  amazing efficiency and  very hot. Interactions  among passengers positive.  arrived on time  but as had  the luggage we  were in the  last queue for  our car in  no time at  JFK Flight back , not as  quick as was  anticipated due to  delays earlier in  our day, check in was surly  and on board crew still fine.  On both flights  both crews paid  special attention to children and I  loved how they  put child lifejackets  into the bins above kids for  every child passenger.  Economy was cheap too, the only  problem being that  we don't have business class on  our flights so we couldn't treat  ourselves to a  day of luxury"
10.0,London to Toronto : Business class  and First return. No complaints at . Both flights departed on time  but landed slightly  delayed Food actually  quite decent for  food and crew  – top of  its game both  flights Had the latest entertainment system  either ways. Clean est seats. Not  much else to  report – if only British Airways could get it  done right every  day 
6.0,"India to London  Airport with British  Virgin OK service  en flight, but  seeing through the  side windows was  an issue as  they are no  screens on the  flight I understand  that airlines are  busy coming up  new solutions but  this is a  big flaw on  a 787, on a long daytime  journey you can't  take out the  window just lower  your intensity. Seat  placement is poor  and almost all  flights you will  see either needing  to climb over someone or have  someone climbing over  you Not up to standard. The  accommodation in Chennai  were also poor."
9.0,"Singapore to London.  Had not flown British Airways long haul for over  5 years I  were pleasantly surprised on my recent  flying trip to . The premium economy seats on the upper deck were clean and comfortable and the food served was  well above average. However, more important was the unobtrusive  atmosphere provided by the cabin staff whereby announcements are kept to a  distance and there is no constant  noise during the  flights Both flights left and arrived on time. Overall a very good experience."
9.0,"Tel Aviv to Heathrow with British Airways. Another good flight. IFE much improved. Tasty food  served promptly with plenty of drinks. Seats not great as usual but  not so important  on a relatively short flight. Friendly and efficient cabin crew. Flight was 25 mins early at Heathrow, which is always a  plus Only downside was slow check in faff at Tel Aviv."
7.0,"Return to London  As with British  Airlines I fly  back very frequently  and the service varies each time.  Our lounge at  Emirates is a  disappointment with only a few seats  and very limited  amount of drinks , 2 miniature bottles of wine between approx 20 . However the  flight itself was  packed with nice  sandwiches and champagne. The cabin service  too was great  all around offering  meals frequently for  the 3 hour flight this was . The flightdeck  keep us updated  throughout the flight.  The only other  issue would be  my baggage was marked with priority  and was one  of the last  people come off."
3.0,"It was a  strange experience while  travelling back from  France to Singapore  by British Airways. Our baby stroller was marked for  the other airline  en route to France, so we  may have to wait long way  and it will  not come back  in Singapore.   We ordered special  vegetarian Meal. As  per their staff,  our meal is  not vegeterian. However  they were served rice and lamb.  Meaning that there  is no alternate  meal made. Even  a refreshment meal  is provided with the leftovers bread which was hard to eat. The cabin temperature was very low and  miserable during our 8 hrs journey.  We pledge not  to take British airways ever."
1.0,"Amsterdam to London. As a member  in their Executive  Committee and someone who has flown with British Airways  three times this  decade I now  regard them as the airline of  no resort. The  attitude on BA  are beneath contempt.  They used to be the source  to most complaints  about flying, but  in my experience  their service and punctuality beats BA  in their reliance on a long  established reputation. Every  single flight I 've taken this year has been a source of  annoyance and disruption.  from disruption in the cabin the  like of which  I have never witnessed on any airline other than British Airways, to  delays on nearly  every BA flights I have taken  during 2016, rude,  demanding staff that  behave like BA  was still a  British state enterprise.  Yet when I search a flight  for BA appears  they shudder. It 's even worth  leaving the UK so you get  a different national . There were  always problems with the booking process. What makes matters  worse is that British Airways accept that they are  right when making a complaint but  did nothing to  make matters right."
7.0,"London Heathrow to San Francisco with  British Airways. BA  where once a classy airline for  their first class service, amenities and food. But they have succumbed to  US economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to  and the price is still absurd even using points.  They even hijack you for an additional $1000. Or  should I like to say, you cough up 200K in points and the $1000 fee covers their real  fee for you to sit in first. They have jammed more seats in so the  planes have more customers. The seat in spite of its new design is tighter and  more comfortable for a 6'1"", 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the  plane Second, the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times I flew BA in first I had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving FC customers. A request for say , additional pillow or second cup of coffee went  ignored more than once which is a sign of inexperience. The last  flight flying home in April I was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu. First class was maybe 50% full. When it was my turn, I asked the flight attendant if I could select some of the tasting menu along with  some from the  standard menu - she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items. Now please explain to me how  the international first class service could  go out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport? Clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching , this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale  - save a few pennies. At the average price  around $10,000 for a first class seat, BA should  make damn sure  second class has all the food you need. Their  website also talks about late night  snacks and on the last two BA first class flights to the US when I wanted to try these snacks they were gone as  most are shared  with business class. The food served is both uninspiring  and generally on the level of US airlines first  flight which is  grilled to death and reheated. Way  you go BA,  we have sunk  to the lowest common denominator. Third, when I arrive in SF and  the spite of my luggage having a priority tag, it never comes  in in the  same batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count. Unlike the first class asian carriers like Singapore and Cathay where my FC luggage arrives <mask> BA is always hit and mostly miss. Finally, <mask> galls me is the worthless survey they ask <mask> to fill out describing my FC experience on <mask> I let them know everything I said in this review and the last question asked is ""would you like us to call you <mask> this review <mask> experience""? Yes, <mask> say and not once has someone called. I am waiting for the day when BA announces ""all passengers including first"" should buy food before boarding and headsets are for <mask>"
6.0,"London Heathrow to  London with British Airways. After experiencing the modern T5, we boarded our flight on time and got sat down. We were in an older 777-200, so the seats weren't very  comfortable due to  extra material and the entertainment screen  is small. We departed late as they had to unload bags, they  even had to reset the entertainment . In the air we were offered beverages. Later  in the flight, the meal service. There was chicken curry (I had it - it was nice but the rice was a bit dry) and a pink-looking coleslaw as a side salad. The dessert was a butterscotch/chocolate mousse, which  looked good. The other alternative was a pasta. I watched some films - there was a good range - and I like how the BBC News is up to date so I could  stay up with the current affairs. The crew were  also overly friendly,  they kept servicing us with extra drinks. I had a nap, and then we were served a small  breakfast snack. The much rumoured Mars Bar is actually true, as well as some Belgian chocolate cookies and other small snacks. We landed on time, but had  to stay on the plane until the immigration hallway became a bit clearer."
5.0,"Last leg DUS  to LHR was  over Europe. While  economy class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke. It  is completely outdated , worst of  which it seems  to be not  long before the  flight Crumbs on  each seat. Table was sticky. Asking  Crew members they  are and are  really friendly and  willing to help  on cleaning. Overall  atmosphere on this  plane was extremly  disappointing Next leg from LHR to  Europe very similar , Business class  and upgraded with  an outstanding new  equipment but seats  where still old. The housing of  the seat was  replaced with gaffa  taped next to  a footstool. Asking  management about that they told me  all the housing  broke off and  they was not  able to fix  it so they  put gaffa tape.  In general the  cabin looks quite  and bit dated , might need  a further upgrade  more than the IFE and some  minor details (e.g.  it should be  upgraded - extremely  wide and roved).  Cabin in LHR  was outdated. Boarding  at LHR was  very uncoordinated as  the lot of  passengers don't listen to the announcements  and try to  interrupt and impede  movement of other  passengers Crew on  flight once again  was friendly and  helpful Meal choice  is ok. But  overall impression is  that quality is  way down, e.g.  meat was very  dry and vegetable  is somewhat overcooked.  The Kitchen ->  Long time an  interesting feature of  flight is a  joke nowadays. Selection  seemed to go  bad every time  we fly. Worst of all: One  of my bags  was not made  back to the  counter This itself  can happen and  is not a  concern at all  as the handling  on this was  a real joke.  On identifying that  my bag seems  ot be lost  I went to  baggage counter (even  after finding it  is not that  hard in Boston).  Just explained my  situation and the  lady looked in  her computer and  saw that I  did not checked  this bag ->  but I had  the tag that  he could show  for her. I  had to discuss  this her for  10 minutes and  had to ask  to the manager  on duty in  order to get a baggage claim . Manager on  Duty was very unfriendly and except  for writing the  ticket he did  NOT provided any  further help. No  excuse for inconvience  at all. Last  time I had  one bag that  is delayed. This  job was done  with another person  who was completely  without experience. Extremely  disappointed and really  sorry about the  process Summarizing: Flying  mainly for business for many years and on a  personal basis now.  The changes under  this new boss  will be seen.  Changes in the <mask> British Airways <mask> really good <mask> seems to <mask> from month <mask> month. This <mask> flight was <mask> of the worst I ever had with BA. <mask> assume that <mask> there is <mask> change in <mask> near term <mask> will choose <mask> airline in <mask> e.g. a <mask> cost carrier <mask> there is <mask> that much difference any more. <mask> you read <mask> lot of <mask> other reviews <mask> will see that I am <mask> the only <mask> thinking like <mask> I can't <mask> longer recommend <mask> as especially <mask> value for <mask> is no <mask> given.

10.0,"Getting to Singapore  was first class  and British Airways  at its best.  The Concorde Lounge  is well staffed , the food , wine was . I was  taken to the  First Class cabin  by an enthusiastic  flight crew. There  was a slight  pause on taking  pictures which was  much easier with  my second glass  or champagne. Throughout  my flight and  cabin crew achieved  that perfect balance  of being friendly,  attentive and interested  as well as  caring what I  wanted The food  is to a  fine standard and  each wine glass  was kept topped , After dinner,  a crew member  talking to me, a mirthful Frenchman,  to my bed . I had  two hours sleep  and wake up  for breakfast consisting  with fruit followed  and a full  coffee The aircraft  was on time  so we left  with a minimum  to fuss. The  cabin was clean,  my seats seemed  spacious and the  bathrooms although small,  was kept spotless.  You could not  remember anything before and during this ."
1.0,"From Heathrow to  India return. I  think Air India  as the worst until I traveled by British Airways  in Premium Economy.  Ticket Prices are  low at all  and thus I  feel they must  be charging more  for nicer services but not all.  British Airways staff  in Delhi Airport  was rude and  demanding I have  got plenty of  baggage limit left but even a  10 mm difference  in cabin baggage  which did not  help as it was little hard  I put in  a case because  no handle. Another  large camera pouch  should consider as a separate bag.  Also was forced  too give my  phone bag to my father in  law and left  in a normal  travel bag with all stuff in ! Coming to  Bangalore aircraft, food  service staff - equally poor. Food  was horrific, seats  had torn, headphone  cable not working,  drink tray was  torn (I was  told to keep  my tray on  my food tray  without support by thighs) , tv  screen was not  at all visible  result of too  much scratches. Staff  was not able  any help at all. Nightmare experience."
2.0,"Marrakech to London Gatwick with British  Airlines Baggage allowance is a joke. Doesn't matter how  much it weighs , long as  items are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by  UK airport staff. Apparently you are entitled to have one case and one piece of hand luggage to carry onto the  plane However, on boarding the plane there were people that had 3, or even 4  pieces of luggage which were far larger than ours.  These items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller bags and put them by their feet causing  us even more  very uncomfortable space  to travel in. Other flyers had  our duty free items smashed and  destroyed When we  spoke to the  ground crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager  on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as  the reference when making our complaint  with customers services team as he  is also shocked by what was going on. When contacting customer services  staff were far  less helpful even given the fact  the there was an airports manager on the flight. Absolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airline. We will certainly never be using BA again."
8.0,"First economy from  to Heathrow to  the return. Check  in at T5  fast and easy  I was able  to use fast  boarding and the  nice Executive lounge  on my FF  after boarding through  to A7 onto  another clean looking  plane Departed on time crew provided  free snack and  drinks on the 1 hour flight. Return check in  very quick although  our security system at BHD is  also very slow.  Also the Executive  lounge which is  packed with a  variety of snacks  or drinks, it's  right adjacent to  a gate used  at BA is  really handy. Departed  in time, seat  taken on another  Airbus A320, crew  had a hot  breakfast on this  one which was pretty good for  a domestic flight.  Flight time on  time return a  slightly longer 1hr  45 min due  to congestion at  JFK Good service,  i guess the  return option not  recommended but would  try again even  had I had a choice."
8.0,"From Heathrow to  Kiev with British  Airways Good flight,  was clean, seats  clean and uncomfortable , it was  cheaper so you  keep your money  and takes your  money Food was  good and was  good Staff were  friendly Captain informative  As a go  to event we  attended Separate lounge in Kiev airport."
9.0,"A very comfortable  journey from London  via Las Vegas with British Airways. Good food and drink and the usual excellent service.  Unfortunately BA seem to have abandoned the practice of  serving afternoon tea at about midnight  UK time and now serve a much more appropriate light hot meal.  Flying back, the  food was surprisingly  comfortable However, on this older 747, the IFE was simply not up to it, with limited content other  than films."
1.0,"I booked and  paid an online ticket for a multi destination 6  month trip that took me from  Bangkok to London,  from London, Nigeria,  Bangkok and back to Bangkok. Before  leaving I called the British Airways service number on  site and asked  how I needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that OK - was told 'yes but  only to pay  the £150 fee', and nothing else  - little steep  and OK. I further checked extra's would be against  the Visa card used to purchase  the ticket, 'of course' was the reply. BA make you pay to  reserve a specific seat now. The  trip started okay but the aircraft used on the  first flight very worn and old - anyway got through to 3rd  plane visiting Nigeria for 12 days business and looked like I could arrange to come home earlier - fired up the BA app on internet roaming service  to find its not possible to re-book on the APP as indicated  - not given any local number  I call -  trying out possible BA numbers - to find they  no longer have an office in  Nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in  Nigeria Operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has  to check the  total cost to come up with  the extra of £1000+. I decline this option and explain the £150 as advised (actually  BA says change over is £0). Later BA call centre call back and say they can offer a  fixed cost - hustling for business like they are  dealing in an open market - however for this option it would  only be possible to take payment  using Visa. It had to be paid in cash to only a single bank branch  near Abuja (during bank open hours) - some 6 hours and 300Km's  - By now  BA had readjusted to fly on the original dates  angry with BA over the mis sold flight and  some impractical conditions they try and enforce. Taking this  up with BA  continues - takes 2 month to elicit a first  response - to  get dealt with on one sided . They do not take responsibility  over the advice given over the phone, will not  acknowledge any shortcomings  with their APP  unwillingness to discuss it and failure  to advise on  some very special conditions that apply to their Nigerian flights. My return  home to Bangkok  was a tired sunken seat with  many worn and  worn table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the  overhead lockers before  take off -  after persuading a  fellow passenger out his seat to  fix this for them that this  was not the former 'flag carrier' <mask> a worn out and low cost discount carrier. Never again."
2.0,Heathrow to Houston  on British Airways.  Best travel experience  on my life.  And the seats were so bad  and uncomfortable with  the cushioning -  we couldn't relax  to go to  rest for the  rest of the  trip The movies  were good but  how am I  allowed to watch  movies on a  device that's smaller  then my iPad.  The food was absolutely atrocious never  in my life  have I had  one bad plane  experience I wouldn't  wish for anyone  and be quite  honest
1.0,"London Gatwick to Antigua. Having flown premium economy with  both airlines we  decided to upgrade our cabin for  a holiday in Antigua at a cost of £350 to British Airways World Traveller Plus, and we were told by the sales adviser that  passengers would receive a bigger seat , more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade, better choice of meals and beverages. What we received was a polarisation of this - we had very poor  service and the only difference between  this and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch. Having flown long haul  for BA on numerous occasions in  the past I am completely shocked at the service we received - it was more like a budget  airline - we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off, this was  quickly followed with a drink service (one drink per passenger), we then received our meal service. I asked for white wine which was warm  and chilled and there was no ice - about 50 minutes later they served lukewarm coffee. This is not the type of service I expect on any  holiday let alone  from the upgraded World Traveller Plus cabin. After several hours when no other drinks service  is offered I went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fiancé, to be told there  was no drinks left apart from  champagne or red wine - which neither one of us drink. As  this flight wasn't full I cant  why there would  been a problem you just don't expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have 2 drinks on an 8 hour plus flight? 5 hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more  than eight hours - certainly not what I would expect from an  airlines such as BA. Our return flight was in economy and the only difference was a slightly smaller  seat pitch but as this flight  also wasn't full we ended up with 3 seats between 2 of us. The service was exactly the same as on the outboard flight ie. same poor standard and for the first time ever there was  a hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant. I was looking to book a long haul holiday to the Maldives next year with BA but after this flight and the appalling customer service I received when I complained about the service on the flight when I was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a  bigger TV screen , bigger seat - which I certainly don't think  really justifies £350 upgrade fee. If you are thinking <mask> upgrading I would think twice <mask> what you are paying for. BA have now lost my custom <mask> having spoken <mask> other people on holiday I <mask> not alone in making this decision and therefore <mask> have booked my holiday next year with Virgin <mask> BA can no longer rely on there previous <mask> name they <mask> cutting too many corners giving poor service and <mask> interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the budget <mask> route. If that is the case, they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are getting a good service for the price they have paid.

5.0,"From Heathrow to  London with British  Airways Good Terminal  to ground service.  My former bmi A321 with AVOD  - which was  good Seat comfort okay for 3-hours , would not have liked any . Staff service  really forgettable from the outset -  we really weren't  making the effort.  No communication and 2 rushed services  for the start  & end of  each flight. Food  is a joke  and a very small sandwich for  my 3-hour flight  - honestly can't  get any lower , can it?) Flight kept to schedule - ticket  was quite good , and my  flight is really  more on the  seat rather than  seats"
1.0,"London Gatwick to  travel with British Airways. BA now stands for Budget ! Having flown BA for many years in all classes from first  to economy, I could not believe how everything has declined so drastically. I was offered a drink, no  drinks were offered, as in the past. There was a choice of 2 meals, a pasta and sausages  or mash, by  this time it got to me there was only one meal on offer, I was refused a second bottle of wine with the meal. Before arrival in Barbados afternoon tea was a mini Twix bar, I took 2 and  was ordered to put one back. The earphones for the inflight entertainment were so uncomfortable and kept falling out of my ears. The return flight was no better with breakfast before arrival being just an inedible bun. Having recently flown on Oman Air, Virgin Atlantic  & Turkish Airlines where the food and drink on offer was fantastic.  Mr Cruz should realise that he is running a once proud national airline not Vueling, BA as our national airline is a total embarrassment."
3.0,"Flew British Airways from Johannesburg to London Heathrow. Travelled several times in Business Class but booked First Class this time. Outgoing flight on 747 seats surprisingly cramped (centre seats), food not great and  entertainment options poor but great bed made up for this. Yesterday's flight on A380 also disappointing but seats much better (centre seats). Entertainment better. Food quality very poor. My starter of vegetable tart had uncooked pastry on the bottom. I returned my main course of fillet steak because it was vastly overcooked and the potato/cheese thing uncooked. The 'chef' told  that all meals arrived in packs and were just heated up. He could not alter the cooking time for the steak. I had a very ordinary salmon fillet instead. The sweet was just two slices of  chocolate cake with a spoon of jam and a spoon of something . The breakfast muesli was horrible and the French toast was inedible. The wine didn't  appear to be what was described and the orange juice seemed out of a carton. The First Class  dining experience was  a business class at the most. Will not travel BA first again. Felt very rushed in the morning  with staff desperate to serve breakfast not giving chance for people to wake up and get dressed."
9.0,Fly from Miami  to London. First  time on the  flight and was  very little surprised  how unremarkable the  flight was because  on board via  the jet ways  and boarding was  considerably longer than  the 747 or  737 The World  Class Plus area  was on the  top deck and  BA had divided  first class areas  to smaller spaces so losing the  view of the  plane The seat  felt comfortable and spacious even when  the seat in  back was fully  empty on the  first night flight  I still had  space and room.  The service was  as usual British  with the cabin crew being friendly  but interactive. Overall  very good quick flight and would  definitely recommend BA  I will stick  with the 787  if I really  enjoy
9.0,"Flew British Airways  via London to Baltimore. Have read so much about this aircraft and  am looking forward to flying it. What a fantastic plane, the large windows and higher  cabin pressure made the plane feel  comfortable and light with no dry plane eyes after the flight. The  addition of traveller plus makes it  good value and the new seats  feel very comfortable.  The flight was smooth, quiet and had a very helpful and interactive crew."
1.0,"Welcome to London , and the  service was on . However cabin  quality is awful,  planes are cramped  and uncomfortable. On board service quality  has declined on  all flights and this flight was  no exception. Offered  breakfast was only  a sandwich (compared  to hot meal !) - it's  no joke. Economy Class complimentary service  should end soon. Cabin crew was  also OK, but  only giving 2  stars because they  would be much greater than the  cost of services . Our luggage was delayed 45 mins at Heathrow  by 5. BA  was offering low-cost airline standard - the only difference  is price, it's more expensive which makes poor value  on money. I'm  still using BA  now and I  can see the  massive downgrade in  price during the last 2-3 years and even more  a decline in  quality Shame on British Airways for sliding down to so cheap and so poor image! "
7.0,"Montreal to London and return to Toronto. O/W leg  from Montreal was the most average  BA experience to  Date Poor third  party lounge with little food choice,  mediocre wines and  terrible ambience. Boeing 787-800 aircraft was substituted by Boeing 787-900 which was  okay on the face of it,  however the same  flight number moved  up from the  second row of  seats to the  row in front  of the toilets - annoying as gate staff unable to move me.  When the air field withdrawn, the  flight went tech less to a  mechanical issue. Two hours later after a total reboot  of the aircraft  and we took . Excellent updates  via captain. However,  the crew were  unhappy during the  change with Biz  staff including me having to ask  for a glass  more water. Bizarrely First was blocked off with lights off and vigorously  ringing with no  entrance to the  proper bathroom. Drinks and dinner served promptly. My choice  of fruit for  lunch had already run out. Only  4 loaded for the whole of  us with honey , yogurt offered  but turned out  too be a 99 cent pot plonked on a  tray No croissant  offered (left in  queue in error)  as the orange juice has been downgraded to UHT  version of a carton. On the  second leg from Heathrow T5, the  departure lounge was very disappointing. Shabby  / poor food  and drink service by the third  party provider, with  filthy / scruffy toilets which I  had to queue ! Worst lounge  service to date , cannot be  called first class  by any means.  After boarding on  a 777-200 with  no first entrance  switched off. The cabin manager was by herself and  suddenly we were  directed towards first  flight  Friendly  with prompt champagne and a prompt  drink service after  lift off. recovered  just a tad.  Menu had not  upgraded since my  flight in October  and was disappointing. The amenities bag  for first is now the old  third world offering.  The menu with  some usual suspects  - Beef, Chicken  & Cod but were cooked and  tasted really well.  My promised cheese  bar had already  run out -  Only 4 loaded. (seeing a theme here) and so  I was fetched  for club. Afternoon tea sandwiches were  cheap and bland.  On the race to the bottom, BA continue to  poor service -  particularly on the food front. I don't find it  uncommon in first  classes for something as simple as cheese to run  up with club  sandwich being substituted.  BA may save money (and wasted food) but the  staff whilst cheerfully making the best  from a bad  situation are not  being given the  choice or or <mask> to deliver <mask> class service. <mask> fact, the <mask> were the <mask> saving grace. <mask> don't seem <mask> get it. <mask> in premium <mask> they continue to downgrade service <mask> save money <mask> gain an <mask> worse reputation <mask> the UK's flag carrier. Biz and First Class <mask> are dropping <mask> an alarming <mask> Wake up <mask> and IAG <mask> before it's too late."
2.0,"I booked flights with British Airways  for London-Kuala Lumpur-Bandar-Kuala Lumpur-London. These were all booked at the same time and they also  had the booking, therefore contract, with Royal Brunei Airlines (RBI) for the KL/Bandar/KL legs. For whatever reason RBI cancelled one of the flights, and it was only by accident that I found this out, by going on the BA website. I had to change a flight and waste  the day in Brunei. BA have refused all responsibility, even on the  pretext of communicating  the cancelled flight  to me. I find this deplorable , booking everything  with BA. I would certainly never book anything direct with BA again, as this lack of service by a major carrier to a customer is despicable."
3.0,The space provided for business class seats on this flight is just ludicrous. I have flown budget airlines that offer better leg room. This carrier is aware  why they have exclusivity on business  class on this route as there are no alternatives.  With the price paid for these  flights versus the  service received this is daylight robbery. Next time I need to travel to CT I will fly SAA  and JHB.
10.0,"from Heathrow to  Allen Dulles with  British Airways. This  marked our return  home to the  airport as we  have flown over  to London on  the BA B747-400 . First from  London We were warmly greeted upon  boarding and escorted  to our seats.  Our A380 interior . First cabin  were immaculate with  much more personal space at our  feet when compared  to the 747.  Here again, the  On board service  is excellent as  were the food  & wine (although  once again the  food was a  little overcooked). I  really hope we 'll be able  to fly in  this again one  final day with  BA"
3.0,"Back to London.  Has anyone ever  be told to  carry marriage certificate  while traveling abroad  from Spain? According  to a British  passport gate agent  of Barcelona Airport,  was supposed to  take my marriage certificate with me  for order to  hop on the  flight and leave ! I drove  over the border  of the States , meet a  friend in Canada  then flew out  from Vancouver on  that same day  to London for  one week, and  flew from London  to Spain for  two weeks. All  along the way  through going through  all of Canada,  USA and Spain,  and was granted  visa without been  asked till the  final day of  this vacation when  she was leaving ! All of  a sudden, this  lady agent asked  my “where are  we going?   Where do you  mean  Are  you traveling alone?” I thought she  sounded rather friendly  until she pulled  her aside from  the gate and  said me “you  need to wait . I need  you talk to … There were  At least over  50 people behind  me waiting and  struggling to figure  out why I  cannot get on  an airplane.  I am a  legal resident of US; however, I  am a citizen  from the country  participating in Visa  Entry Program, which  means I don’t  require visa to  enter Spain and  especially not when  I leave. So,  whats wrong!? My  names on the  plane pass and  passports are matching  and the name  on my US  permanent Resident Card  did not match  with my passport.  Of course, I just got married  and that I  had different last  year from my  wife but even  so what kind  of right does  she have to  check me for my US Permanent  resident Card and  stop me at  the gate like ? So, when  someone asked me  if I have  enough documentation to  prove the mismatch  from my last  year I jokingly  asked “marriage certificate??”  Last thing I  realized was I  cannot get on  an airplane because  I didn’t have marriage certificate with , and what  was it even  matter was after  we spoke to  her she said  telling me ""you  may go this  week but next  year you will  need to have  wedding certificate with "" It was  just ridiculous!"
9.0,Dallas/Fort Worth to London Heathrow. Excellent service overall in British Airways First. The first class  cabin interior was  an excellent condition  and the staff could not have been nicer. The  cabin featured the  all new First cabin and it was quite elegant. Food and wine great as well although the steak  was a bit overcooked. I hope  you fly with BA in First again.
8.0,"Flew London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel with British Airways. No queues at terminal 5 at lunchtime - everything was very quick and efficient. Flight was punctual and well organised and service good with one exception. The flight info said there would be a “snack” but all we got  was a small bag of crisps. Although it was a near two-hour  wait over lunchtime,  There was no food offered nor could we purchase any. (No shortage  in drinks, including wine, though). You have been warned."
4.0,"Flight to Lisbon  by British Airways.  A bad flight, when a person  did not want  the check in  luggage it is  best he packed  and not waste  money in the luggage pick up.  My luggage was taken during the  security procedure because  they said the  plane was full,  and it was  because there was enough space to all to have  the mini trolley . I had  on the plane,  some people that  you must say had bigger luggage then my own.  Back in the plane fast exit  from Heathrow and  carry on flight a bag of  nuts or peanuts,  nothing healthy. On  my arrival at  my plane parked near the Military Aerodrome on Portela ( Maduro), and 10 minutes bus ride to the  airport and more 10 minutes to  wait for luggage. Long time BA customer but do  not know if I will fly again."
1.0,"I flew a  business trip with  BA to Miami onboard one of  their A380 aircraft,  wondering what has  lead to this ? Outbound flight  stopped 1 hour  later we had  to due to  the broken seatbelt  that should have  be spotted during  landing Having flown  the route several  times on the 747 we were  look forward to trying the A380.  we were seated  in row 31  that is the  first row in  our mid section just before the  large galley area. From the moment  I sat down  the was a  loud whine coming  from the wall  below us! Upon  questioning the crew if this would  stop they said  yes it was  from fridges in  the galley and  not the engines  so we wouldn't  hear it. This  carried on for  2 hours and  their crew issued  some ear plugs to wear and  said that the  sound was ""normal"" on all their  new aircraft. The  meal was horrid  and only a  flight of 2  and I chose a curry which  contained no flavour  it was incredibly  cold The return  flight was a different A380 which had the same awful noise but  it did stop  for 2 hours prior to arrival.  The food on  the return was  absolutely disgusting as  was the outbound  flight and as  usual the ""breakfast""  only consisted of  one cold bagel  type thing with  the blob of  melted cheese in  it middle. The  temperatures have dropped  how far it is incredible. I'm  told if I  flew in row  2 on Emirates  or the like  I wouldn't be  covered with ear phones I'm booked to Miami once  more in early  January fortunately on  a quiet 747  and after that  I will no longer fly with ."
9.0,"Paris to London  with British Airways.  Cheap flight. Fast , full flight  that left Lisbon  on time and  got to London  and no delays.  Economy on flight  was nice for  so a cheap ! Not like  a return trip . British Airways  make us feel  good when the  trip is ok."
3.0,"The flight started in the First Class Concorde lounge at T5. It is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats. The seat cushions need refilling. The general ambiance is quite good. A refurbishment is long overdue. The food quality and choice is generally quite poor - although the Crab Tortellini was good. Nobody invited us  to choose from the menu or to offer drinks. I had to walk the floor and find someone. All sloppy. The menus also were worn and scruffy and someone, a  waiter I think, had scribbled on the inside, some funny cartoons. We boarded and the flight departed to the minute. All good. The Boeing 787 has a small 1st Class and I realized that the space also is smaller than the 777 option. The 747  option is a total disaster and I go to great lengths to avoiding flying their . Food was OK. Very little wow factor. The meze was fine. They ran out of Cod -  although at this  point I don't think we had hit the cruise. Seven from eight passenger - and only one Cod apparently. I had the lamb which was alright but  in short night flights I prefer not to have meat. My wife's allocated seat was - broken, hence the vacant seat on the flight. So she sat one side of  her plane and I sat the other. Brilliant. The plane was only six months old.  With the competition on this route you would think  BA would want to impress. Was it a coincidence I wonder that there was no Arabic or Asian passengers on the flight? With Emirates on this route - why would there be? We landed on time and then had  a walk miles. Another underwhelming experience with BA. I  wonder what those who spent £3,000.00 one way thought."
3.0,"The flight started badly in the so called new Concorde lounge at Dubai. I have reviewed this in  my lounge section. The situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departure. Apparently minimum rest period had been compromised. Not sure  that this was true but we ended up with a 787 crew not a 777 crew. On the 777 the First seating is double that of a 787 and result was we were served, the entire full cabin of 17 - by one FA. He did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy. The Boeing 777 first seat is the largest of the three options (747/787/747). Mine was starting to show signs of wear. No amuse bouche. As announced last month BA have cut back this  - Wow, a £3 saving on a £3,00o one way ticket. Well done BA. Champagne was lukewarm, as  was often the case. Lamb and  tomato salad appetizer was ghastly. Horrible in fact. The soup was the usual Butternut squash soup (do they offer anything else or am I unlucky) and was lukewarm but okay. The apricot chicken was pleasant enough but I could not taste any apricot. A bistro product at best. Later in the flight I had afternoon tea - sandwiches. All dry and tasteless. Watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this  worked fine. Nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice.  All without being stacked for a  flight As one comes to expect with BA, underwhelming due to the bean counters at LHR cutting back  staff as well as increasing fares. I'd like to see the entire BA board removed and a new dynamic team of  man and women with vision and inspiration for our  new carrier."
4.0,"Gatwick to Alicante. Crew friendly but a bit amateur , business class Club Europe cabin. Upon boarding I found my row of seats dirty  - lollipop stick,  empty hankie wrappers, newspaper and empty water bottle all strewn across seat.  I had sat  on gate for an hour since  arriving from Glasgow,  but isn't it  raining and why don't the crew  check the state of the business  class at the very least? Pilot  came on the tannoy and said because there were meals being served we had to wait for 6-7 more to be delivered. This delayed the departure by  30 minutes. More afternoon teas were carried on (and crockery). Cue lots of banging and clattering in the forward galley. Crew  member offered a  coffee once which I thought was  generous for a  European cabin. Not very proactive. Call  also went unanswered twice. I asked for a Baileys and ice to  top off the meal when I managed to catch the attention of  Pilot As duty free trolley rolled back I was  handed two bags of nuts instead  and another CC. Gave up at  some point."
3.0,"Fly Heathrow to  be with British  Airlines and they  have some of  the oldest planes  flying this route , the screen  has only 6""  long square lines  on the screen. The food is very poor on  board compared to other airlines covering the same route,  only two offerings  of water on the outbound flight. Usually fly this  way in business  class and British  airlines offering is far inferior product  on this route ! Despite being Silver member will be voting with  our feet and  using other airlines  options available on all future travels.  There was one  long trip too  far with British  Airlines"
1.0,"London Gatwick to  our return. British Airways is a  bad airline and  you will never  fly it again. Paid extra for  premium economy and  paid £192 to  be sure we  would sit together,  something I have never had to do with airlines  for long haul.  we were told  this may be a small charge  when we booked  our holiday. The  lounge was very  noisy and dirty , floor was dirty, my tray  was covered in coffee stains. On  the outward flight, one footrest would not stay up,  going inward the  foot rest and leg support would  barely work. The crew gave us  the champagne welcome  but vanished until the food came,  even if you  would have liked  your drink. It  appeared the crew were very tired  and just fed up serving people, I suggest they  switch jobs."
10.0,"This was my  second time to  fly into London  City Airport with  British Airways. I found the experience to be very  pleasant indeed. The  gate agent was  both friendly and  helpful and made  me very positive  first impression. The  ground staff were  helpful and polite , boarding was  quick and efficient. During this short  journey the captain  were informative and  the cabin crew  performed a sterling  service at serving  tea and snacks  during a relatively short flight. Disembarkation  seemed orderly and  each bag arrived  on good time . I am  still very happy  traveller and will  fly this route  later in the  UK"
2.0,"Had to fly out of Johannesburg  on BA on 27th October but  owing to aircraft  issues (A380?) managed to get onto another flight (Boeing  747 to ensure I caught my connection to Charlotte  via London. This particular Boeing 747 had clearly had its day, but  while infinitely better than my return flight on the  day I paid  an additional fee for my seat , irrespective, felt ""packed in"". The  problem was very  much slow service  by section cabin staff and   it my opinion  way too many  seats are accommodated  on this aircraft. Chaotic boarding did  however help matters.  Do in future use one of the US airlines for this route."
9.0,"Welcome to Los Angeles. Initially late boarding as aircraft was late on  arrival so cleaning  had been better.  Get over and  everyone else was superb! The overall  atmosphere isn't flash but rather understated  sophistication which you have to be  Italian to fully understand I suppose.  Excellent champagne, fine  wines and cognac complimented the restaurant 's a la  cuisine meal and  the service was second to none  in our geordie . We loved  this fact that one of our  meals could be  used as a  table for 2."
2.0,"London Gatwick to Mauritius return. Our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable, but new to British Airways we were prepared to wait and see. The inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experience.  We paid two supplements for the flights. A substantial fee to upgrade from Economy , a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! The combined cost therefore was significant. The benefits were not. Firstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. A lady ahead of us had a headrest problem,  and was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  Throughout the flight  and waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. Food - as we had flown this class on  all scheduled airlines, we were expecting a menu to select meals. How silly. Here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto). So, no Choice! No bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a 'choice' of one red wine, and plastic cutlery. This was served after the attention in Economy, and may account for the absence of choice. Whatever, it  tasted awful. It was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. What a waste of resources. Significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. The Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toilets. It was necessary to go forward to Club, or back to Economy! It became clear early-on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin, so back it was! During the night, with passenger debris in aisles, this was hazardous with  using plastic bags (from headphone containers) to slip on. Is nobody in British Airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential?  On arrival in UK we read that BA is to put even more seats in Economy class on this type of aircraft. Goodbye British Airways - not even nice to have used you."
4.0,"Flying to London , in economy . The food  on a 4  hour flight is  like a sandwich  for lunch. 1  food service instead  of 2 in  good old days  so you better  get everything you  want for the  next flight. British  air service keeps  on getting worse  and worse. It's  another shame because  their crew are  just generally friendly  & nice people.  They will only  keep getting worse , worse if  fares are cheaper  than all the  flights which they  almost never are."
7.0,"London Heathrow to  Mal Lumpur. Concorde  arrives at LHR , Check in easy at First Area. Was excited  to try the  new 787 and new first on  my special occasion trip. Cabin intimate with 8 semi  standard suites. Look  nice with nice finishing touches of  glass and chrome,  but seats quite narrow. Champagne before take off. Nice crew but slightly  overweight and not totally familiar with  cabin type. Main  menu was very  bad Scallops overcooked and main beef  is overcooked on  one side. Breakfast ok. Bed for  two comfortable but  quite narrow. Power outlets wouldn't work with my iPhone or iPad. Table  before dinner wouldn't  fit properly and  the light fell  out of its  place - on a new aircraft?  I had a  great flight all  round redeeming Avios  on occasion. The  newer first is an improvement but  they need to revaluate their offering against competion, likes  of Qatar Airways,  Air Singapore etc, because their products  or onboard service  lag behind. "
2.0,"Its a shame  of once upon a time being such a good  airline to now  get service at  such high price!  On such an old tatty plane each way, very uncomfortable. Entertainment was old and tired.  had to keep  stopping many times just to change the channel. Food was like mush on the way  home and on  the return they served me a  small meal as  was all they had left. The cabin crew service was very poor on the return . The crew looked miserable as  if they didn't enjoy their job. Asking for anything  seemed like a chore for them. One of the crew looked so  tired her hair was all over the place. I asked to buy  another bottle of  shampoo when they came round with  it duty free. The steward said he would come  back with it soon. I waited  & waited, then  asked him an hour before landing. He apologised and said he forgot,  so he will bring it down , Again I waited, and just  as we were  going to land  and asked again, he returned with a bashed in  bottle of perfume and said sorry but this is the last one. I couldn't except  it as it was very badly presented for a gift. After all  that if I knew it was the last one,  then I would have chose something else, but it was too late , we were  on Terrible 12  minute flight."
3.0,"Get to London Heathrow, and wow, British Airways has gone downhill. Very  rude and abrupt staff and the  service if you can call it that, was a sandwich and a  cold coffee in a paper cup. This is on a five hour  flight British Airways needs to take  one look at the likes of Qatar Airways etc."
2.0,"First time using  British Airways as always flown Virgin but routes from Orlando to Gatwick were full with Virgin. The flight  got cancelled with no reason for 24 hours. No  even a text message sent to my phone 4  minutes before departure  and no telephone or contact number. After an hour of ringing everybody  I could at BA I ended up being passed to an offshore call centre. If you deal with BA this will be where you call for everything - cut off three times and completely incoherent. I was traveling with  a wife and  8 year old daughter in ""Club World"" seating. The  aircraft was over 18 years old and whilst serviceable, it was in a dire state. My daughter commented ""this is like a dustbin with wings daddy"" when  we got into the cabin. On arrival to my ""Club World"" bed it had a  small piece of plastic that had fallen from somewhere.  They handed it to a stewardess who said ""that bit isn't important"" whilst looking down at me and taking it away.  The inflight system  is a joke, the resolution on the screen made  it almost impossible to see anything. All the pixels were broken. The charging for laptops etc was US only and the remote for the  navigation system didn't work. An announcement came on before we left ""we have a passenger travelling with us  who has a serious nut allergy.  Please do not  carry any nuts at anytime"". Once  we had taken off we were served warm wine with a large  glass of mixed nut! I am proud to be  Australian but I  feel incredibly embarrassed  of British Airways to represent my country in such a poor way. Fly with anybody other than BA. Trust me, they 're nothing short  of a joke. </s>"
6.0,"Flew London Heathrow  and Bangkok with British Airways. Cabin looked worn and dated. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Disappointed with lack of snack with bar service, in fact I previously flew in June and the airline always provided  the fully stocked 'help yourself' tuck box. Inflight meals a disappointment compared with other airlines. Inflight entertainment satisfactory.  I have had  similar inflight experiences  with other non direct airlines on this route."
4.0,"Welcome to Geneva.  Im not sure  British Airways are  ready to short  change business anymore  and can see  BA going high  with economy seating  again as some others do. Business  the same as  as everyone now  talks about, but  the downgraded food , lunch consisted  was a small  salad with a  piece of ham,  side of Palma  Cheese and dollop y buffalo mozzarella  cheese and a  bread roll. And  that was that.  Not even butter  on the roll.  But the value  for food was  only GBP1. Crew  tried their best  on a poor  economy Flight on ! Not worth  a premium over  the ticket."
9.0,"it does seem that many of  the negative reviews of British Airways  are from passengers  of First or Business class. My wife and I  travelled from Heathrow to Los Angeles , found the  overall experience extremely  satisfactory Boarding was efficient, the seats were comfortable and  the leg room  better than adequate. IFE was very good. The food was, well, it  is airline food , you cannot expect haute cuisine at 38,000 ft.  Breakfast was tasty , and there was some decent red wine. The cabin crew were  outstanding in every way, both friendly  but efficient. Would  anyone recommend BA to a friend?  Not without question."
8.0,"We booked to fly Club World 4 months ago. Turned up at St Lucia to be told British  Air had overbooked  so we had  be downgraded : this is on  our £1700 ticket.  According to the duty manager, they  always oversell the  extra cabins and  staff are fed up with apologising  and angry passengers.  we were given  £ each travel  day as compensation, so it means  you have to  contact British Airways again. We ended up in World Traveller plus (premium ). Seats were  available but it's the standard Economy ! Breakfast was  a croissant which  has come out of a fridge,  it was disgusting."
2.0,"My flight from  NYC to Boston  went okay. Disappointed  that only be  allowed to sit  at middle of  row of 10.  Sorry to have  them pay extra  to have a  better seat. Also  breakfast on board  was disappointing with  the one meal  with a biscuit . crew were  nice and helpful.  The return flight  is different. Staff  was particularly helpful.  Sat in front  of seat fully  but I wasn't  trying to fit  the tray in.  One member said  it was causing  problems for the  man in front  so I requested  to put his  tray up to . Also armrests  do not lift , leaving less  then 6 inches  of seat in  middle and armrest  so I was  essentially trapped in  my seat for  4 hours. Not  pleasant and unsafe  in an emergency.  Only had one  meal trolley followed  by a meal  for an hour ! Staff then  left and only  water or juice  available for rest  during flight. Will  now use BA . Delta and  Southwest flights offer  much better service."
9.0,"London Gatwick to Valencia with British Airways. Boarding the flight at Gatwick was good, professional  & orderly. Ground staff at the airport were lovely and check in was efficent. Onboard we got out  at the gate and under way quickly. Seats were fine, plenty of leg room back in economy, although they seemed to be a little dirty when I sat down but I thought nothing more of it. During the flight , cabin crew were professional doing their duties. All friendly and welcoming. Food wise we only got complementary biscuits - a little bit of a let down - but on a short flight , this totally understandable. Drinks were fine, got the normal selection: Coke, coffee, juices etc. On the return  trip it was slightly different. They  seem to have  less in stock not only in the food department but also the inflight shop. Disappointed in this as what I wanted to buy wasnt avaliable.But on this return flight the  positive outweigh the negatives. Flight crew  was amazing. All kind and welcoming like the first flight. Overall the flights were nice. Well worth the money. Definitely would fly with them  again on short  leg flights through ."
2.0,"London to Seville via Madrid. If  you want budget airline service but  premium airline prices, look no further  at British Airways. I used to fly a lot with BA for both business and pleasure. But lately they really started dropping the ball. In 2016 I  have a streak  of 8 consecutive flights all delayed by 30 min to more than  4 hours. But  this is not  its worst. Recently I booked a flight to Seville  via London. After a few weeks  the flight got  cancelled It took  me 3 different  calls to find  another solution via  email on the  same day. ('No  I don't want  the fly the  same day!). But  Guess what, 1  day later my  trip to Madrid  got cancelled as well. Again it  take some time to find an alternative. Ultimately I  have to settle  for a 7 hour travel time  rather of 2.5 hours. Also I need to take extra holiday and  travel costs to  fly to my destination in Seville. After complaining to  them about this , I expected to get some  kind of compensation,  for all I'm an esteemed Silver  Member (their words).  Apparently none of that. A few  phone calls later I am stuck with an automated  BA service replying  telling me that  no compensation is possible. I didn't ask for any  compensation or anything.  All I asked  instead is to waive the re-booking fee if I ever have to  book a flight. This seemed only fair after BA cancels flights willy-nilly  but doesn't take  the customer into  account If this  is the service  acceptable to a Silver member, then I really don't want to know what they do to customers not  members of their  cheap flyer scheme."
3.0,"US Airways state  seats you can  opt in for . When I  requested availability 24 hours prior to  the flight, there  are only three  tickets available for  the three of  these I also  wanted to have  the window seat , only available  seat were aisle  seat in C  to J. Due  to online check outs I had  only the option  or select an  extra seat. At  arrival at LHR  we spoke to  BA customer services  member advised that  depends on how  often you pay  for the seat,  not certain seats  may appear available , in short,  the less you  spend you get , the less  the seats with  seats not being  provided This is  now a new  rule and the  crew member said  that has led  in many complaints  with customers. The  aircraft was a  737 reg G-CIVV  bought in 1998.  The aircraft had  just renovated a  couple of years  ago and had new seats and  improved lighting. However  - aircraft tables  was not clean,  the room was  dirty and the  aircraft is ""an "". These are  spoken words of  the cabin crew , not me.  Really - the  old is an  A when compared  with the new  aircraft Cabin crew  are very friendly  but were not  easily seen, only  at the start  on the flight.  Breakfast was ok  with veg lasagne  and a nice  cheese mousse. However  my one meal  ruined towards the  middle of the  flight by a  bite size chocolate  bar and undrinkable . BA wake up - look , see what  their competition is  doing aircraft wise  - sort out  this unfair check  in policy."
2.0,"From Heathrow to  fly with British  experience To fly to disappoint. After  the arrival in Heathrow T5 the check-in area for  Air Europe was clearly marked and  marked for the  area of the check-in lounge and a host was  guiding you to  your check-in line.  While saying hello  to the host  on my way  to the check-in  lounge I was stop with an unpleasant “Excuse me,  it is business class”. Like a  naughty school boy I returned to the lady and show her my boarding pass which  enabled me to  join the “exclusive "". Check-in was  complete and I  arrived airside in  about 20 minutes.  In time for  some duty-free shopping  in an airport  well decorated for . Being a little bit hungry I was looking for the “light  meal or snacks "" prepared for  me and “drink from our World  Class bar” as  is promised again  from their website.  My only   purchase made was  2 sad sandwiches  and after checking 4 empty bottles  for display I found some warm , white wine.  So I decided  the cut my  time spent in  their “comfortable private lounge” and treat myself with some Costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the  Lounge Waiting for  the promised menu which “features irresistible meal options crafted  that perfectly match  your time and duration of your flight”. Couple months  later a tasty  lunch with canapés  was offered to  you in Club Europe. In the  return flight I  was offered the  food option “beef or fish” with,  and a nice  big smile from  Captain Purser. The tray looked like  an Economy tray  from a Tarom or KLM flight  in Bucharest. No  longer an overlapping  main meal option of cheese and  a merengue and a fish which  is the blandest food I ever  tasted onboard. When  everyone was still  waiting for my  "" British experience”  my tray was taken away. Coffee  and a second  set of drinks  being served shortly  as the main meal service was  and I couldn’t stop wondering where  my smooth, stylish service from my  last flight went.  Of course, the crew was polite  but nice as  much as they can, shaping their enthusiasm according the  food offered to  me And another  strange element: no  complimentary drink service;  I needed to ask for another drink as the  staff was busy  to stop the  club Europe toilet  on the front from leaking and flooding the entire  cabin galley."
10.0,"I have traveled with British Airways many times in the past. It  was reliable and safe but the attitude of the  ground staff put me off. It therefore came as a pleasant surprise that this seems to have changed. The stewardesses were  very friendly and attentive. The aircraft was a Boeing 787 with a seat configuration of  110 which was good. In-flight entertainment was very good and it worked.  Service at Seoul Incheon airport was  very quick. We departed more or less on time , got to  Korea on time but had to do one circuit  because of traffic. All in all a very good experience."
9.0,"Flew London Heathrow  to Cape Town  and Johannesburg. Effortless  packet drop and  return transit in  some very quiet , Silver card  flight so made my way to  London North. Plenty  good seating available , sadly I  arrived too early  for the dinner service so ploughed  my way through  my rather poor  "" tea"" sandwiches.  Lunch selections however  was tip top.  Landing at remote  airport quickly turned  in a scrum,  with passengers crowding  into the entry  doors preventing passengers  attempting to board  or doing so.  Large part to  blame for boarding  the A380 so  soon before the scheduled departure time.  On board flight  1 to JNB  proved up to  speed with a  nice young mixed-feet  passenger and good  fitness levels. The  economy on the  flight puts that  on its sister  BA fleet wide  commercial aircraft to shame. On time  arriving in JNB  was then onto  the morning BA  Express connection to  London Flying Comair  was like flying  high in the  morning with full  buffet service breakfast  and a bit  good old fashioned cabin service (endless  cups of tea!).  The arrival in  Amsterdam made for  great end to  the good journey."
4.0,"I was very disappointed to find  that British Airways are now a very 'middle of the road' airline compared to a  year ago. Why? Firstly, compared to my only other  airline in an A380 (Qatar Airways) there are more  people crammed into the BA business. On the outbound  leg only 1 of the 2 upper deck toilets was working and  in the return  journey my in-flight entertainment screen was broken which meant , it was not visible and kept springing back to a near  horizontal position. The only possible solution  the steward could  find (as there  were a critical  piece missing) was  simply wedge it with a cork  which sounds very  reasonable for a 21st century airline  but whenever we hit slight turbulence  the cork kept  popping out and  knocking the screen  from view (very  handy when you are half way through a film). The flat bed side window cabin  food was good  and the beef that was my  second main course  tasted tough, tasteless and quite inedible. I gave up  about 10 minutes  just trying to  taste it and chew it. They did at least have a nice  strong red wine.  My staff did well enough. I  continue to fly  here a lot and am a Silver Card holder but it is no longer my airline of choice."
9.0,"I hadn't flown British Airways in a while but I thought I'd  pay them a  go again. I  was in Club World, seat 64K upper deck from  London Heathrow to Chicago. Let me  start by saying that BA crews  are tremendous. They are friendly, approachable, professional, amiable and  knowledgeable The flight  crew did a great job in getting us there safely and they were informative without being over bearing with their announcements. The service on board was very good, the food was plentiful and quite tasty. The  flight entertainment was excellent. Loads of choices and great . All in all a great  experience Based on that, I will keep flying BA  for my transatlantic flights. Again, the crews are a  credit to BA,  who do a great a job."
4.0,"Vancouver to London Heathrow. I was  booked on Air Canada but rebooked  on British Airways as I was unable to make the AC flight  when AC cancelled an earlier flight  - YYJ to YVR. Having flown British Airways in the past, I was looking forward to flying them again, but my trip was somewhat disappointing. Seat on the Boeing 747 not the most comfortable, but still a slightly bit  comfortable than on  Atlantic Canada's 10 across Boeing 777-300ER.  Dinner served after takeoff was chicken with rice - it was fairly tasteful. Cabin crew seemed approachable, but after the meal service, cabin crew disappeared and made very limited appearances during the 9.5 hr flight to London. I wanted a glass of water and had to push the call button - then waited over  20 minutes until  a cabin crew walked by. Before landing, breakfast was served - consisting of a tasteless pretzel bun and granola bar. It 's very evident that BA's service standard has slipped considerably since I last flew with them in 2013. How the mighty have fallen."
7.0,"At Heathrow to  London with British Airways. Smart and clean A321. Young  flight crew dealt well with demanding  that drinks trolley  handed over and a child who  kept on standing up in his  seat for takeoff.  Only a bag of nuts for a near 3 hour flight but we all know this story. Yes, they are reducing the service but  their other forms , medium-long transport  (& ferries) includes  this in the  mix"
9.0,"We was pleasantly surprised by the  experience first time for premium economy  on this particular . The seat  is comfortable with  great legroom, the  food was excellent , airline food  from both ground  staff and flight  staff were friendly  but efficient. The flight was quiet and smooth, on time and made up time on  another flight. The only downside was  when the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour, despite the crews  stating it could not be restored for the remainder  of the flight.  We did note one steward enter  a premium economy  flight with a  radio and upgraded about 15 people into business, the rest of us went without for  two hours. It worked fine on the return journey . I guess  is just one  of those things,  it annoyed me  that a certain  select few were upgraded and the rest ignored."
10.0,"The flight Kuwait  to London was  on a refurbished  The flight was  good time, cabin  crew were hard-working,  service was a  little British, and  the in-flight entertainment  included AVOD, and with a wide  selection of movies  and a huge  amount of classical ). The flight  went smooth, and  the information from  our flight deck  brought us up  the date on  the progress of  the flight. The  cabin crew even  managed to find  one last miniature , single-malt scotch  for me (good  job guys). Transit  to Heathrow was  smooth and the  flight to Edinburgh  arrived on time,  on time on  an Airbus 319.  Both the service  arrived on time,  my cabin crew  kept the flight  well and the  plane came out at Edinburgh with  little hassle. The  return flight was  very good: prompt  arrival from Edinburgh,  smooth transfer at Heathrow, and on-time  return to Kuwait.  Good time, an  Boeing 747, with  the small seat-back , so I  could not bother  about the entertainment . The evening  meal was the  usual ""chicken or "" (come on,  when can't we  get a change) "", edible and  delicious and the  cabin crew were  pleasant and unobtrusive,  coming through the  cabin regularly with juice and water  for this overnight ! Overall, the  experience was up  against the usual  standards I expect  from BA: I  felt safe, comfortable,  properly fed and  rested and all  three journeys were  on time and hassle-free, with a  great set of  cabin crew and  the tidy and  efficient aircraft. Well  done BA."
10.0,"British Airways was the cheapest airline  so I booked this flight from  Birmingham to Gatwick,  cheaper than Easyjet.  Great service, ok  local food. Professional  turn round. Captain spoke with me , Plane was on time and no issues. Best  possible flight from a great little airport."
4.0,"silver card holder  - British Airways . PPS card  in Singapore -  London to London  flights - average  English when called  - service staff  with a bit  off an attitude  but it wasn't  my job so  they do BA  no favours. 1.5  minutes late and  you sent the  luggage to the  wrong part of the airport so  20 mins delay  to the baggage  and Barcelona flight . Worst bit  was BA codeshare.  If BA 2190  checks out it's  like BA have  not got their  acts together on  it at all- cost silver card holders booking BA  flight had zero  boarding rights -  had to charge  BA for second  flight - free for silver card  holder Get to  BA lounge BA  has explicitly asked  that Vueling codeshare  should be excluded  - no ability  ot use lounge.  Unable to pay  and select my  seat BA trying  to save money.  Unfortunately the Vueling  flight was third  - none of  my check in  flights to Singapore  was BA leg  - so I had to go  through the BA  lounge to get  scanned in before dropping my bags  back to BA  - I have close to a  billion miles on  me - I  booked BA for  the trip -  it could have  used SQ /Star  flight - your  last couple of  days focus on  passport control and  the cheap and  not sorting out  your codeshare process  to both standards  - your poor  service interaction that  they treat me  as a cardholder  that works just  like me in  your ""will fly  the next time  you come to  this bracket. You  are cost cut  it out of  business"
1.0,"I am tall, 196cm to be exact. That's why on a recent flight from London to Brussels I couldn't face being crammed into a microscopic economy seat. Instead I decided to pay £385 to fly in British Airways ""Business"" class. What a mistake! On arrival to Heathrow's Terminal 5 I tried  the enter the queue at zone B as directed by one of the information signs. I was told that the staff had decided to close that so I had to go somewhere else. I joined the queue at ""C"" instead but was told when I  walked to the front that business class checked in at H. I made my way to British Airways business class lounge, which was crowded, dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run-down bus station than an airline's lounge. The place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates, cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room. It was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where I waited for my flight. The gate was announced and  I made my way to gate 10C where the  plane was being bussed. I was in seat 3D. It was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom. The  selling point of spending £385 was legroom and I didn't have any. I asked the flight attendant if anything could be done.  BA would not have been my choice anyway but I do understand that given tight schedules and limited choice sometime you are forced to fly with a particular company against your better judgment. In that case don't make the same mistake as me. British Airways."
3.0,"Welcome to Heathrow.  I cannot believe  why British Airways  decided to embarrass  the staff so  much as they  try to cope  to all the  fuss regarding the  services served, which  we were never  informed about. We  spent over £700  on our flight, two of us.  That is so  hard for loyal ists if we  have to go  with Easyjet or  maybe we would,  but to receive  that same treatment  in a great  disappointment"
6.0,"A chaotic check  in at MLA, with no British  Airlines staff checking  passengers is queuing  up resulting in  a lane being  filled with non  business class /  family members. Security  staff more busy  than Ryanair and  BA passengers going through priority/ fast  food Flight ok , warm food  cooked in mushroom  soup or beef  or crushed potatoes  and also with  salad and enough  water to make  you feel sleepy.  Except that if you have a mushroom allergy beware as there is no option to  test your meal  directly or over  the phone for  that specific allergy - BA should do something about  it Annoying passengers as per usual  when using LGW , for me that's a holiday  experience with people  I don't fly  much yet they  seem to be  flying Alfa and  scared of flying  at the point  where we were  cut off by people behind us for reclining our  bags and I  said ""obviously you  cannot fly much""  despite us being  blue with BA and gold with LH...). Landed ahead  of schedule but ended up waiting for bags until  they were offloaded  and having a  luggage tag on ... Excellent and friendly cabin crew."
3.0,"Flew from Bangkok  into London Heathrow. Once again the 3 cabin B777. Crew were very friendly but not very attentive when it came to service so I never got a welcome drink. The seat was the standard Club World seat which is ok for lying down or sitting full up right,  the in between feel awkward. The food was bordering inedible with especially the steak cooked beyond all recognition.  As always BA's lack of dine on demand and  free snacks were showing (the Club kitchen is getting worse each flight it seems). However the meal service is reasonably quick at just over 2 hours from take off and a significant improvement on the outbound flight. The inflight entertainment selection is quite good but the screen are small and terrible and the cabin as a whole could benefit from  more total over hall. Pre-landing snacks were better than the main service but still not  much writing about. Crew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out on servings. If I had not managed to get the tickets at a heavily discounted  discount I would have felt cheated on both the hard and soft product provided. British  Airlines needs to step up their game to get my money again."
4.0,"London Gatwick - Pisa Return. Another  less than satisfactory experience with British Airways. I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. When I first flew this route (as opposed to Ryanair) on arrival you had an air bridge  that made it a more satisfactory experience. Now, as a cost cutting exercise - you don't. Which means if its raining you get wet. which we did. The BA LGW Club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the North terminal. It was fine. Very busy - but the light lunch was better than BA's own set up - the last  day we used it. Plane left 40 minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slot. I  settled for a couple of G&Ts - and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fine. On the return the ""Club Europe"" lines at Pisa check in were used by just about anyone. It was a zoo. The BA airport crew didn't care and given the management at BA don't care about customer service and quality, why should they? Lunch was quite pleasant, some sort of Chicken dish. We got stacked for 15 minutes which is annoying. On both flights I got the front  seat which gave more legroom. The seats? Well the usual abysmal so called ""Club Europe."" A disaster and only worth the  trouble if you buy them in a sale. FAs in both directions were splendid. They get very embarrassed  about talking about BA cutbacks. Who wouldn't? Flying 1st class next week to the Middle East. Not holding my breath that it is going to be an eye popping experience."
1.0,"We pre-booked seat  number and, on  my seat, noticed  papers piled at  end of seat,  broken plastic bottles  of paper etc.  in the cabin  were dated and  dirty Also the  home entertainment screen  would not work.  Upon arrival in  Bangkok complained to  British Airways but  had a somewhat  late reply apologising and received a  small £20 e-voucher  in compensation. When  arriving back to Thailand (Flight No . 27 Sep)  a check-in member  of staff advised he was unable  for print of  a pass for  the flight Bangkok  to Chiangmai but  told me this  seemed quite normal  it would cause no problems. With  flights booked through  my final destination I was advised  at Bangkok airport  that without the  necessary boarding pass,  we would have  to go landside  and check in  at Bangkok Airways  flight check-in. A  major fiasco ensued  showing the ineptitude  at British Airways  and BA motto  - fly to  Thailand - I  could not."
8.0,London Heathrow to  Las Vegas. Outbound great welcome and  excellent Homebound friends  had same great  welcome from female  passengers on their  end of cabin.  Unfortunately my wife  & I were  chasing after young male attendant whose  accent was rather  erratic and for  us everything seemed  ot be too  much trouble. Detracted  us somewhat from  our very enjoyable  fully booked Vegas  experience - think maybe the guy  is in the  next career. Boeing  - OK but  little bit tatty all round. I  think they're near  me
1.0,"Tokyo Haneda to  London and British Airways is cost cutting all the time! I was  very disappointed with the onboard catering.  After a 12  hours flight there  are no mid flight snacks or food. The tuck box vanished from your offering. We  are served a small breakfast at  breakfast (9am Tokyo time) and nothing until 90 minutes before landing. Pretty much 10 hours with no food!  So not  just the food available seems to have been reduced  and it is  also very poorly timed.  It looks like despite BA's good profits, they are cost cutting to extreme . Perhaps the CEO could try out this sector in World Traveller or World Traveller Plus (rather the the First class he probably uses on a long  distance flight) and see how he  looks at the  start of it! Maybe he will turn a little skinnier! Certainly not  as enjoyable or  relaxing experience!"
8.0,"I had a  perfectly satisfactory flight with British Airways  to Boston and  Paris this month  ( 2016). I  slept most of  the way had  to nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude  your taste buds are pathetic and had no alcohol. The only reason I fly first class is that the beds are  less comfortable than  second world and  I dislike the club seating arrangement.  Aside from breakfast scrambled eggs I hardly eat on  long haul. Generally speaking, the cabin crews are good and attentive and it's a bonus  if you get some ex Concorde crew. I never want to board  an aircraft early  because I know that I will not have trouble stowing my bags in first. A previous review complained that on the 787 there is only one toilet in first but  they are only 8 seats. All in all, I use BA because  unlike the UK I can get to any part of the world  quickly with few changes and in safety."
1.0,"From Francisco to Manchester via Heathrow.  An improvement from the outbound leg  of this journey. A 2 year old A380, the  cabin were much nicer than the  previous outbound flight - seat 82a, I did like  my extra storage bin to the side of the  cabin by the  door which freed  me room on the floor (can't say if that's  the good thing  from BA or  bad on this aircraft though as it was my first A380 flight).  Take the positives out of the  gate No sense of organisation to  the boarding process . 400 folk  waiting by a gate. Cabin crew  were uninterested during boarding. 7pm departure so I was looking forward to  getting a meal  and getting to sleep early to  hopefully get back on uk time as best as I could. At  arrival meal arrived,  little choice offered and bits missing  were both mine and my partners , I got  a bread roll she didn't, she got a dessert  he didn't, neither of us got a drink and  my gosh it was a travesty  someone had the cheek to ask  a member of  my crew for  a Diet Coke! Woke for breakfast  after a few  days sleep and instantly regretted it. A folded omelette  and potato wedges  in a cherry  pie (breakfast of kings). The final couple of hours was spent watching  my interactive map to see how  much I had  been to suffer and listening to  the cabin crew in the back  talk about various things in their  daily lives. The  10 minute call  was from the  pilot and crew  had prepared the cabin for landing.  My quick connecting flight to Manchester was pretty much  that same too. If I could  count things as  5 stars I  would I'm ashamed British Airways is my national carrier."
2.0,"Flying to San Francisco via Heathrow. First time flying  for British Airways and will most certainly be my  final 11 hour  journey from London  bound to San  Jose on a  very very tired looking Boeing 777-200  - not what I had expected.  The system was  poor in choice  of colour pixels on the screen. Couldn't sit with my partner as unlike most ""leading "" BA opt  into a system  with charging if you want to reserve a seat before check in opens? When check in did open  passengers were assigned seats miles apart and the plane  is fully booked - so 11 hours of no  seats IFE and the option to  return to my  partner involved a 5 minute walk  off the plane. We could have opted to go  on Virgin cheaper but decided it would be nice  to go with  Emirates Who as far as I can work out are on Ryanair's  list of additional . Never again British Airways, never !"
3.0,"After many years  of flying on  after being a  staff member for  my last 6  months I have  finally lost my  patience with BA.  ) There is no point BA even having a  passenger relations team  as it seems  the hands are  to firmly tied  and be able  and do anything  to a loyal  passenger when things  go wrong. I  once spent over  month on a  flight to Singapore,  both being First and inbound in  BA World. The  plane was a  relatively new A380  but on the  first journey, the  crew developed issues in the toilets  where the toilets  might not be  flush properly. The  crew on board did their best  but after things  but still wasn’t  the very pleasant  feeling from the  passengers (and the  airport might I  add  On  getting Inbound a  3 days later,  they were delayed  for 3 hours  bc of a  plumbing issue in  our toilets where  it was no  drinking water throughout  The entire plane  must have been  that same aircraft  as the outbound).  BA ground crew  dropped everything to  go and fix  this because they  did feel it  was fair departing  on a 13  hr voyage with  not running water  to the toilets.  This meant no  hot water to  clean the toilet  but the suction  machine still worked),  and not running  water to clean  toilets and of course no tea  / coffee facilities.  Several hours had  passed and the  crew decided to depart anyway, the  decision was to  land the plane  with loads of  hot water and  soap in the toilets but no  tea or coffees  for the whole  flight (they had  better get the plane to land  back at LHR ) before the  2 hour delay  and stop each  party claiming 300  Euro under the  airline compensation policy (the plane landed  safely to LHR  after 54 min ) To top  it off, after  getting back to LHR, the ground  team from BA  failed to tell  the airport ground  staff of a late gate change  that resulted in  the bags delivery  be delayed by a further 1hr  30 min. So  In summary, I get home 5  hrs later than  planned with toilet  problems on the  plane which created  a bit of  bad smell around the whole aircraft,  with toilet issues  on the way , delaying the  flight and making an uncomfortable journey  along the way , and seriously  delays my arrival back home with  some baggage issues  attached to it.  BA has the  potential to get  any decent amount of compensation in  that situation regardless  of the class  we are travelling  on - the  answer from BA  public relations was : Avios Points!  is 15,000 going  ot get me?  So I ask  I can do  that and the  nice lady on  her phone (who  then embarrassed herself  trying to tell  us couldn’t do <mask> as the <mask> decision is <mask> Can I speak to the <mask> I ask? <mask> am thinking <mask> a loyal member spending so <mask> on BA <mask> might have <mask> decency to <mask> to me), <mask> answer was <mask> they don’t <mask> to anyone. <mask>"
1.0,"Bari to Gatwick. Yet another abysmal  service from BA. No wonder the majority of passangers  on short haul these days are  booking package tours.  Those making individual  flights obviously travels with other more customer focused airlines. Check in at  JFK was resonable  and unlike on  any outward flight,  where the boarding process was the  usual expected chaos.  This decision to  use hand luggage  with tickets is  the poor one.  Like other airlines, no attempt appears to be made  and regulate the  size or weight  the bags carried  onto board. On this flight, I  had several arguments  about locker space.  The cabin crew  treated us with bored zombie like  English Meal service costed of a  single edible sandwich hastily delivered with no finesse. The  meal arrived a good half an  hour later than  our food! It  is the the  stated aim of BA cabin crew  management to provide  good service as fast as possible  and maximise the time available to  customers in the  lounge Do BA  passengers never sample  the economy short haul product?"
4.0,"From JNB to  Australia via LHR.  So disappointed and  expected so much more. After reading  your comments have  all agree that  Gulf Airways standards  had slipped dramatically.  I flown first  the same routing  a while back  its very evident  you see the  short cutting in  many aspects that  are definitely not  worth it to  offer that sort  of pricing. Food  was at all up to standard and can honestly  not have had  much better experience  being flown business  with Gulf and  other carriers. Its  another real shame , when you  talk to staff on board all agree and are  so embarrassed. On  the positive point,  crew on all  flights were really  friendly and helpful, just let down by a poor  system"
3.0,"Flying to London. First time flown with British Airways and the last.  Service was slow,  quality is poor to say the least compared to other airlines, and to be honest the last time will use them. Check in was fine as done most of it online myself, boarding ok. On value for money I  would recommend another carrier. "
3.0,"My wife and I have been  flying British Airways short haul in Club Europe for  three years and until recently have  done more than  satisfied with the  experience provided. Noticeably,  each year that  service has become  much more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience  during this recent  journey to Malta ex Gatwick. Departure  TIME was 0750  but we arrived  to Premium Check-in at 0620 to find only one  person of staff  working the desks  between First and  then There were  a least 10  people waiting in  the queue, some of whom defected  to Economy desks  and were heavily  jammed with faster  incoming queues. Only after more than  10 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we  left the desk  the attitude of  a Check-in lady  leaves much to  become desired -  somewhat unsmiling and  indifferent is probably a kind description.  it would have been good to  had been informed that the No 1 Lounge was  available in the  back of the  lounge offering, but no mention of  the lounge was  mentioned at all.  The No 1  lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load, but that is another story. Boarding  went fine, but  our in-flight service  from a totally disinterested cabin crew  was perfunctory at  times The meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered  until after all  food had been dispensed. Clearing the  plane was even  worse The flight  was in final  descent to Luqa when, returning from  the toilet, I  found one of  my cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her I-pad whilst bottles and  drinks remained at  bay which then had to be hurriedly removed as the Captain announced  for crew to  prepare for landing"".  Should I have  paid for being  a mere passenger  during this lady's games session? Appalling - and such  stark contrast to several LHR-PRG early  morning flights over  the years when it has been a joy to  travel BA. This  may just have  been a bad flight, but I  doubt that this  marks the future for BA unless  something at the  company reads these reports and takes remedial action before it's good name  becomes lost forever."
2.0,"Flew with British Airways for the first time from Sydney to London return. Very unsatisfactory compared to premium  flight experiences with other airlines. Had to pay to  reserve seats and  not only was  it no priority boarding, the World Traveller Plus customers  in fact were  very last to  arrive There were  about 6 rows  in premier economy,  but was told that the meal  line has ran . The meal  brought me back to air travel  of the 1970s. The starter consisted  of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato.  The fish was  bland and tasteless and the rice  an unappetising grey . The dessert  is a square  and plain cheesecake.  All beverages at  table were served in thin paper ! There was no other service, no offer of water or snacks  with the meals. Toiletry consisted of  a wash and nothing else. The  seats were not cleaned and replenished during the stop overs in Singapore. The seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg  rests of other  flights BA World  Travel Plus is certainly not value  for money and I will not  stay with them ."
1.0,"New York JFK  and London Heathrow . British Airways.  Do bear in mind that this complaint concerns a business class ticket. Customer service is non existant. I  did not choose  seats on line.  Called for help and was told  that was not possible for them to do it  on the phone.  Should I use another browser. I  told a friend  who could try  with her pc and another browser.  Different story. Unable 't choose seat.  Call airline again  and was told  again it could  only be done  by airport staff. After pressing them for the number  and being assured  it was being  given the contact info for BA  for JFK, I called only to  find I had been given the  wrong phone number for JFK. Absurd.  We hadn't used  this airline in years and never  have again. It's a shame. They  ought to be such a class  company"
5.0,"We haven't flown British Airways for  such a while  but this journey to Nice drew home to me  that BA is  no longer the premier airline I  expected it to be. Trip was  of no major  problems but my  point being is  because it is  not different to  any of the  various other airlines I have flown  with as EasyJet,  Singapore Airlines, Flybe . Cabin interior  felt a bit tired, I asked  the air hostess for a Diet  Coke and didn't  find one. One toilet between 120  + people in  cabin isn't great  on a 1 hour 40 minute . Cluttered galley  with people waiting for the one toilet, congestion in the aisle blocking  out flight attendants  is not ideal.  Never get me  started the flight  BA airline was  cheaper but no different than the  others lower cost  but when comparing ticket prices BA  not longer has  an edge for me."
3.0,"From Heathrow to  Malaysia Lumpur. Very  good service. This  being their much  cheaper Boeing 787 first class. Could nt book a  table in their  cabin despite trying  and book 3  months in advance. The cabana in  our lounge was  nice and had  one clear partition  for the toilet/ chair Nobody bothered  or check if  I needed anything.Priority  there was a . Outbound service  on board was  the Cabin crew  failed to anticipate  your needs. No . One toilet and the same size as in a low cost  flight Food OK  but not great.  On arrival I  questioned the chief  complaining about fast  track only to  be brushed off  with ""we don't  do fast track "". Return flight  is equally poor.  After the bell  ringing no one  in Rang again  took an hour to order breakfast.  One came and  says ""of course  when we start serving from the  buffet side"". So  much for first  time dining on . The only great part of the trip was the first class  breakfast in Kuala , thanks to  Malaysia Airlines as  that is their lounge and NOT  Qatar Airways .  Malaysia lags behind  La France La Première as far as first class  dining is concerned."
10.0,"Travel with British Airways is always a good experience, took a short  flight to Majorca out on 10/10 returning 14/10 from LHR T5. Flew out on G-EUYY A320 and back on G-EUXF A321 both excellent flights, the crew were very smart and welcoming and the aircraft clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the lunch and bar service going out and refreshments and  drink service on return. Noting other reviews its a  shame people board flights hungry as  their are many outlets at the airports prior to  leaving even major retailers do good ""meal deals"". The crew make the difference ensuring a safe comfortable flight."
7.0,Still cannot believe  that British Airways  had such a  narrow seat pitch  for such a  small aircraft. I  have been on  several short haul flights that would have been far  too comfortable let  along a 12 hour flight to  London I am  not overweight but  I am 6ft-2ins tall and when  the passenger in  front of me  took his seat  their was absolutely  no space remaining.  That total lack  in space ruined  my otherwise flawless  experience and would  certainly make me  consider alternative airlines for long haul comfort in future.
1.0,"Seattle to Prague via London Heathrow  on British Airways. Check-in took about an hour (online checkin was not available). The catering onboard is the  best from all European legacy airlines. The breakfast on  a long haul flight was a bad joke (bread with cheese and a muesli bar).  On the 2 hour flight only  served chips or biscuits. I talked to the cabin crew on most of the 4 flights, they encouraged me to write reviews, because they do not agree with the company catering policy too. Also the performance of the crew is of a very low quality. The aircrafts were new, that is of course more important that food."
2.0,"Welcome to Heathrow.  British Airways gave  us something I  wasn expecting - probably my worst  commercial flight experience . Clearly BA's  security measures have been primarily concerned  about turning economy  flight into the  ultimate 'cattle-class' experience. They really need  to up their game to compete  with Singapore Airlines , Emirates -  they deliver economy  style travel at  prices completely different  than BA - where do I start? Cramped seats  that even felt  too small to  my children (6 and 8) and little leg room.  It feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel, let alone 12. The food was laughable - yes,  BA says on  the marketing blurb  their are 12+  items to choose  from but it fails to mention that they are inedible. I thought  a children's meals of macaroni cheese  might be a  safer bet -  a grey gelatinous  bits that turned  brown made even  the cabin crew blush. The entertainment  provided just about  what the children  entertained - but  the high hopes  - kiddie rucksack,  free 'kids' treat  bags and a  welcoming welcome for the under 12s was completely lacking.If  you have a choice go with another airline. Go with Emirates."
1.0,"London Heathrow to Budapest with British Airways. Yet another abysmal flight with : The majority  on passangers these days seem to be large tour . Perhaps that's why service standards  and comfort resemble a 1970s charter . The cheaper no checked baggage tickets, allowing a ridiculous 23kg of hand luggage, cause  delays on boarding,  as 2 or even 3 people  having to lift heavy luggage into the lockers. Consequently  toilets are blocked and while these  transfers take place. All semblance of  the boring has  been abandoned, there  was no welcome  upon board, only  loud shrieking from  flight attendants to  those seated quickly  enough to place  luggage small enough  on the seat in front to accommodate said oversized  heavy luggage. The  seats on my flight were hard and uncomfortable. Cabin so called service,  almost nonexistant. The packaged inedible offering  presented as breakfast  is thrust at  me with no finesse, and accompanied  by half a  hot cup of  stale stewed tea. The cabin staff  seemed hell bent , racing through  customer service to  make time available  to chat in  the galley. The  one redeeming feature was that the  flights left on time, and arrived 10 minutes early. I was only  taking the flight as part of a tour group.  Even independently, I  could have opted for a rival low cost carrier."
4.0,"Washington Dulles to Nairobi via London. Was excited to fly First Class on BA from Dulles to Nairobi, since it's about 15 hours of flying time I decided to splurge on a 1st Class ticket. Things started off poorly at checkin when BA's computer system  went down  a seemingly constant problem ) . After 45 minutes of waiting, they  was finally able to get a back up system going and I was checked in and off to their Lounge. Great meal and service there. My flying companion didn't want to splurge on a 1st Class ticket so she was in Business Class. It wasn't long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she's seen. BA has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight, meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when  your asleep. Well I sprung for an $850 upgrade  for her and all was well. Until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart. Here's where BA's systems again breaks down and their computer isn't working to locate the bag in the hull. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. We land 3 hours late at Heathrow and miss our connection to Nairobi! No one to assist you; head off to another terminal  for customer service, wait 30-40 minutes  on line to be told that they can put you on a Kenyan Air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait  for the next  morning and fly out on BA. We chose Kenya Airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag. On our return flight I had booked a  Business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since I couldn't use my 1st class ticket. No, can't do that and you'll have to apply for a refund. Meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis! I  was told later that that is ""promotional"" and to hell with a paying passenger. The bottom line is, don't fly BA if you are going on to a distant location, they are unreliable , assistance is negligible. If you're just flying on to the Continent where there are multiple flights you  never make it."
1.0,"Flew Malaga to Gatwick. Although a better flight than two weeks ago the 'service' of a small packet of crisps, peanuts  or biscuit is a disgrace. At least with other airlines you can purchase food. Passengers were hungry and  cabin staff were clearly embarrassed with the megre offering. For our national carrier to go to this low base and makes a mockery of 'To fly-to serve'. We will choose any other airline over British Airways in future - human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the BA  crew (although the  cabin staff did their very best). No doubt BA management can't wait  and get their hands on more of our money when they start to supply food at a charge. Truly shocking values  clearly not customer focussed in any way whatsoever."
3.0,"We were very excited about our  Air World journey to Mauritius and  very disappointed we were. The food  were great, the wines weren't either and the foot board of my "" bed"" kept on collapsing so  I hardly got any sleep. The cabin staff were  lovely and very  accommodating We have  a Virgin Upper  Suite and it  was much better as your bed  is made up with a duvet  and sheets. All we got on  British Airways was a sort of  very nasty blanket and no sleep suit either. Very  uncomfortable in all of it. Our  flight was terribly  late because the incoming flight to Gatwick was struck  with lightening which is not BA's  business I know . I would have thought they could provide another  flight to save  us to wait  as long as  they have done  with the past. Maybe they just  never have spare  seats any more long haul. We have travelled British Airways Europe several  time in the  last 3 years and think this  is wonderful but long haul just  did not do it for us , certainly we  know next time  I go long haul we won't have to travel British Airways unless  we pull up  my socks."
5.0,Return journey Gatwick  to Dubrovnik. Outward journey seating was basic but were at least served a basic cardboard tasting breakfast and one drink. Return journey departing at 12 noon only served either hot drink and 1  snack or cold drink and small of packet of  biscuits I think this is slowly acclimatising people to refreshments being withdrawn completely early next year on short haul flights. Staff were very friendly but they must be embarrassed by the lowering of standards on British  airlines
3.0,"We recently flew British Airways business class from Calgary to Rome via London and returned  the same route. Like previous reviews we too will avoid British Airways  by all costs. Although the cabin service and staff  on all of our routes was exceptional the layout  of the international business class seating is brutal! Who designs seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or  climb over their feet?  Even worse is what British Airways sells as business class within Europe. They  offer nothing more  like economy seats with the middle  section blocked off. My husband is 6'4"" and I'm 5'10"" and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us. Could you make your passengers feel anymore cramped?! My biggest complaint about British Airways is having  to pay to reserve my seats! They are the only international carrier that does this.  Especially in business class. When I  signed on 24  hrs in advance, there were no seats to choose from - and to my utter surprise my husband and I weren't even seated together. Shame on you British Airways for being so cheap! We are flying to Europe again shortly and will  definitely be looking  around On the plus side, food  & service on our flights was exceptional but your customer service leaves much to be  said"
1.0,"London Heathrow to  the return. Appalling : The booking  system is dreadful : they charge  if you want  to change seat  for economy, I  had been told  you will be  charges for food  and drink from January, and the  app very difficult  for use. Their  customer ""service"" via  phone or email  was abysmal (they  are extremely rude,  sometimes completely wrong , and I  had been cut , given wrong  tickets and put  in to loop ). Whilst some  on the cabin  staff are lovely,  they are extremely  rude This week a steward refused  and help me  place my cabin  seat in the  luggage locker (the  suitcase was not oversized, but I  had a bad  one at present,  and I asked  him very politely)  - yet he  never refused though  it helped other  passengers I flew  first class a  month ago and  my fold out  bin was filthy , even though  a steward saw  it he ignored  my wet coffee  table and salt  was everywhere and  I had to  repeatedly ask him  for clean it.  Which he did,  albeit with very  much grace. I  use British Airways  when I can,  because sometimes the  right routes and  times fit best  for my needs.  But every single  flight I do  fly with them,  and am reminded  why I dislike  them so much."
2.0,"Mexico City to Malaga return. Things started badly when  the 2 year  old son was  late on a  missed booking reference. The call centre in India refused  my help fix  it saying I  could manage his  flight because it  is in my  name Then we  got a three  minute delay at  BA - something  to do with  BA miscalculating the  baggage allowance. During  that time BA didn't give us any food or  drinks and gave  you no updates  as to what  was happening. We  were just under  3 hours late,  but couldn't get  our Return journey at Malaga, another  two hour delay.  When we got  there tried to  check Avios points  exchange website, but  was getting 'system error'. Then tried  contacting BA customer  service and after  checking through the  BA system was  told that ""due  to disruption your  flight cannot be  accessed  That's  my last time  you fly this  totally uncaring airline.  "" The only  news is that  Mexico City is  one great airport  over a weekend!"
4.0,"Come on British Airways. Really. I have flown BA long haul on two journeys in the last four weeks. First from LIM-LHR and now LHR-DEN. I know  how BA has refurbished some of their B747-400 and B777 but the  aircraft are a disgrace. As a  British carrier, what message does this send to the rest of the world? On a  positive note, the  BA crew are  extremely polite (sometimes to the point  of being passive-aggressive),  but this is a humourless service. Even London Underground has moved from  their dated uniforms.  And in-flight catering is lack-lustre. I choose vegan because the standard meals  were truly awful.  You now even have to pay for the snacks  and meals (unlike  LAT or LATAM). I understand the economics are difficult,  given that some  companies subsidise flag ging but small and low-cost changes would make a major difference. Firstly,  beef up the staff (have you  noticed the LAN ?) On the last flight, one crew member hadn't shaved and it wasn't designer stubble.  Throw some humour training into the  crew and just  keep passengers flight comfortable. The IFS systems are so  old that they match the reruns of old BBC sitcoms/ soaps offered.  on a positive note: 1) I  believe BA is  the safe airline  with the crew professional. Big bonus  point for me. 2 When there is a problem, BA is efficient  in sorting it out. 3) Communication  within the cockpit is usually good."
2.0,"Being a gold Exec Member and this was a redemption flight one should not really complain. But if I was paying 4000 UK for this I would be out raged. The Aircraft at B777-200 well past its sell by date. The Crew whilst personable and very pleasent look bored. The food is a disgrace, wines (white warm), reds (cold) so bad as when I asked for the Business class menu to compare it with First, was superior in every way. Example being First - Soup versus Business Crab Tian? The CSD just apologised and said I know its a  lie but we keep telling them. Aircraft was so  heavy the ceiling fell in with the celoptape loosing its grip and some foam plate  sticking out. It really is past a laugh asking people to pay their rates. Overall I find BA moving to a 3 star, its overall product is lazy, apathetic, inconsistent and tired. The crew are fantastic in the air as for the  Economy well its like a tube station or a civil servant job for life atitude. My advice stay well well away for premium prices,  the Euro Business is laughing stock."
5.0,"I hadn't flown  with BA for  quite a number  of years, so  upon seeing their  current fleet, I  came expecting something . Instead, it  was like being in a time warp. The aircraft  has seen better days, in my opinion, and judging  from the IFE  markings and the  cabin design, damaged  seats and uncomfortable  seating it showed. Our nearest toilet  was out of action, not good.  My crew were  in the service  is okay, it 's just a convenient way of 'A to B'  In my opinion,  nothing else. Only  should this airline manage to update  all they offer,  improve (aircraft wise)  or provide as much emphasis on  those everyday economy folk as they do on their  frequent fliers, I  will consider them 's Value for  money is negligible,  and after using other, forward thinking  British airlines, the  service made the end of a  pleasant holiday feel somewhat sour."
8.0,"Flew British Airways from Boston to London Heathrow. The plane was clearly dated - judging by the old IFE screens and even some rust  here and there , but the plane was clean, the crew were extremely nice and polite. The food was good, although I would say the light meal just before arrival could have been a bit more substantial. Overall, it was a nice flight. A note on the ground service: the way it is set  up - with  one line for bag drop among others and multiple counters that can call for this and that spread out - leads to some people not hearing being called. I could clearly hear the  counter annoyingly saying  you have called them and they  are not listening  so I am not doing it anymore"". I really think it is not nice, given  some distance between  those counters and the lines and the natural noise on an airport terminal."
9.0,From London Heathrow  for Lisbon with  Portugal Airways. The plane was slightly  slow but the  pilot explained why  and we recovered  the delay on  the way. I  find communication to be important and  appreciated the gesture.  All crew were extremely nice and  every snack we were given was just fine for  only a short  delay I am  very sorry we had to take  the bus in  order to get to the terminal.
4.0,"Toronto to Lisbon  stop in London (outward) and stopover in London (return) with British Airways. A mix of Premium Economy and  Super Easy check in at Toronto where the staff are great and the club lounge  like usual was clean, welcoming and well run. OK  snacks with juice and water offered on boarding. Bizarrely, no sparkling wine offered (""Sir - we only offer  sparkling wine on  return from London"") No hot towel after take off but menu card offered. One round of drinks followed by dinner. Steak was overcooked, dry and with a  nasty gravy - the worst meal to date. The biggest insult was the breakfast which has been downgraded from the ""muffin or nothing"" to a basket of smaller muffins, chocolate and cereal bars plus tea / coffee and juice. Just when you thought BA couldn't stoop any lower,  they manage to find something else to nickel and dime. Good club lounge in T3  with decent showers.  The flight from London to Lisbon was one of the best short haul flights for  BA A younger mixed fleet crew , really friendly,  offering great service and a prompt drink and snack service - a tasty roll (2 bites) and a  drink (1 bite) with second drinks provided on request. Returning from Lisbon, a dreadful bus  ride to the aircraft, a more sullen and older crew with average service with the mini savory roll replaced by sweet or savory snacks (shameful that BA are increasing the sugar on offer across most flights with the current  obesity debate). The BA lounge on the B gates at T5 remains  my favourite lounge with plenty of  seating and some  comfort and quiet.  Also one of the old 747's with the old configuration with PE in front of biz class with juice, water or sparkling wine offered  on boarding. My IFE had frozen  as I sat  down and even  then reset had a mind of it's own. The  onboard video was abandoned soon after starting for a  quick demo as there were clearly IFE issues across this aging 747. I finally gave up watching TV as the channel kept changing. No hot towels again.  Next drinks round , on asking for the little bag of pretzels, I was told they had be cut by embarrassed  cutter (at around  20 a bag - really?) A vile coleslaw starter, a choice of steak or butter chicken curry which I had and  the small pot of chocolate pudding completed dinner. The chicken was tasty but not a business class entree (as claimed) by any stretch of the imagination. Tea and coffee but no after dinner drinks (had already been cut). The biggest insult in this continuing degradation of service is the scrapping of the second meal. The sandwich has gone with either <mask> cookie or single finger of chocolate with tea / coffee with <mask> embarrassed crew (again). This constant reduction in the PE product with the small stuff can't go much lower - there's <mask> the seats <mask> space left! Ironically, whilst in <mask> the announcement was made regarding short haul food and drink being charged for in economy. BA are being disingenuous to <mask> that people are asking for improved catering - yes, they're asking <mask> you've cut the service back so much in the first place. I'd pay for a decent M&S sandwich but I enjoy my free <mask> Charging for <mask> / coffee and juice - <mask> Air Canada haven't stooped that low. I really worry for BA's <mask> The drive to improve the <mask> line has gone too far. I don't see fares being reduced to reflect the reduced service. The board of BA / IAG group and their shareholders should be ashamed and embarrassed with <mask> as the demise of the UK's flag carrier continues."
4.0,"Flew British Airways to/from Heathrow recently as first experience. Have read a number of previous reviews commenting about the indifferent attitudes  to cabin service. I absolutely agree,  but what a shame. But BA, if you actually read some of these reviews, you can actually retrain and improve our perceptions quickly. When boarding, rather than  simply pointing to which aisle to  avoid walking down, actually have your cabin staff positioned (even in economy!) to assist passengers struggling to load carry on baggage  and to get seated and out of the way of others. Many of us are unfamiliar with the somewhat different controls on the newer 777's. Perhaps a handout as we board or a  tour of cabin ? On long transatlantic flights, cabin  crew disappear for at least 4-5 hours mid flight. Perhaps an occasional trip down the cabin once every hour or two  to ask if customers need anything? (Or are they fearful of the extra work?)."
7.0,"I frequently use  US Airways morning  flights from Boston , London, and  back again, but  the reduction in  the quality of  food served in  flight is startling.  The English Breakfast  menu was a  complete surprise until  our last flight,  after which the  lack of portion  size and quality  became noticeable. The  standard landing snack  has always been  a decent chicken  egg sandwich, but  for this flight, it was a  disappointment - maybe  because I forget.  Our cabin crew  was efficient and  helpful and the  service was excellent,  vastly improved from  the older 747's,  as we have  experienced on the . Beware, however,  Long Track security  from Heathrow, which  even in the  past six months,  have been glacial,  but better than  the lines."
5.0,"New York JFK to Düsseldorf via London Heathrow. The  plane check-in was  quick and easy. The choice of seats (free of charge) was very  easy even the plane was half-full. The check-in (baggage) organization in JFK was a mess. Long lines with no priority for  passengers You should arrive min 2hours before the boarding, otherwise you will  miss your flight.  The staff  in the plane more less accabtable.  When hand luggage got misplaced in the plane, I  heard somebody just remove it. I asked the staff,  well at least they found my hand luggage. Recommendation to BA, staff  is partly unacceptable. Beverages and seat comfort in total ."
4.0,"For simply next time we fly, and where possible, we shall use any other airline (with one exception being South African Airways) rather than British Airways. Flew from Johannesburg to London Heathrow. The seating in business  of the A380 is dire and the description given by another reviewer that it feels  almost if you are in a coffin is pretty accurate. The staff  are just about acceptable, but they  seem indifferent and just going through the motions of serving the food and beverages whilst trying not to look too bored whillst doing their job. Oh, and my TV packed up and froze, so I was unable to watch  or listen to any music for half of the journey. The Qantas business class seating is superb and just how all the other airlines should configure their seating on the  ground Shame they don't fly to South Africa, although, if they did,  its would be impossible to book a seat, as everyone would choose to fly with  them and not British Airways."
7.0,"London Heathrow to  London Took off , landed on  the Sandwich on  this outbound flight  was good with  lots of drinks  in this short  trip Return flight  is offered again  with plenty of  drinks a full  meal Seats hard  and okay. Service  great on both  flights Tickets expensive ly for two  tickets got it  down to £150  on avios points.  I only booked  one week before  departure"
2.0,"Flying Gatwick to  Birmingham I never  in my life  took a flight  was bad as  THIS one. My husband and I were flying to  Manchester for our second anniversary from  London Airport. The  attendants were rude and inattentive. I  hit the flight  control button so  several times, and  while waiting 20 mins, they just  turned it off.  And that was  only the worst  about it -  the flight was  very cold. We asked if they could please turn  it up (they  didnt care), multiple passengers asked for  extra blankets (not that it would help). I was literally shaking the  first flight through, even though I had multiple layers  of clothes on.  I will never  go direct to  London with British Airways. I paid more for a direct ticket, than  a indirect flight,  but thanks BA  on letting me realise paying more  will equate to better service."
3.0,"Paris to Bangkok via London. What a mistake to choose BA for this business class flight. The experience of the seats (with their weird coffin-like configuration, sliding screens, and people climbing over me almost continually) was enough to say ""never again"". The service was very patchy, with some  really long-faced and size-challenged cabin staff.  Very undrinkable, and forget having a  single Main course near to inedible,  although the portions were thankfully miniature. The wine selection was good, but my unsmiling stewardess told me there  were no Bordeaux ""only merdock"". (I should have explained  how Medoc is a Bordeaux region, but really). This  service comes nowhere close to Thai, Emirates or Cathay. Singapore Airlines is in a league way way ahead. I should add that the lounges in Paris and London were great. Paris was a share with Cathay, and London's Terminal 5 lounge was excellent. Shame about the flight and the quite hideous  cabin tight, face to face with a complete stranger, noisy and hard."
1.0,"So dire. They  started installing a  special check in  process which failed.  Long queues at  check in and  you had to  wait to be  moved out of  the line or  it would have  lost our flight , arriving well  into advance. They  even lost our  luggage both mine  from my partners,  and they didn't  actually get it  at the Glasgow  airport The luggage  was 2 days  to arrive in  London that's 2  hours from a  5 day break  so we had  to stay in  hotels on luggage.  The online information  system didnt match , we were  told verbally on  the phone and  most people we  speak to were  very rude and unhelpful. We submitted  a formal complaint  through our return  on BA website.  It took them  over 3 weeks  in reply and  when they did  they accepted no  complaints and gave  us a list  more excuses about  how they had  this new check  out service that  were causing problems  from London. Totally  unacceptable to the  people in Glasgow.  Totally appalling company  - gone are  they days where  they had a  good reputation for  chasing after customers.  No we will  NEVER fly with  anyone again unless  it is absolutely  any other option."
2.0,"Here I am again after my previous review 2  years ago of specifically the British Airways online check in system. I am currently in Cyprus on holiday and will be flying back to London this evening  to my elderly Mother. We sat next to each other last night at 1930 and  had our BA apps on our  smartphones at the  same time. My Mother had a choice of 12 seats (on a 300 seat Boeing 767), and I  got a choice  between just 4 seats. Again. So clear evidence of passenger inequality at BA, even though the passengers are  all in the same cabin class. This happened 2  weeks ago when  travelling from London Heathrow to Larnaca.  And why do I, who flies  4 times a year with BA, only get 4 (very poor location) seats to ""choose"" from, and another BA Economy passenger gets a choice of 12 seats  a choose from?  Also why do BA offer an  extra check in  system which is not fit for purpose? When I  flew with Aeroflot, you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your  seat As it should be with every airline. But  they appear to suffer from some  type of 'seat  sharing issue for some reason. I  guess they would rather people pay the £15 to choose a seat in advance on top of the  already high price of their tickets,  which I personally will never ever do."
9.0,Flying to London Heathrow with British  Airlines The was  a first experience  flying BA's A380  and it was very comfortable and relaxing. We usually fly Etihad from Australia to LHR but this time decided to try BA. The boarding at Singapore was  quite friendly and on time. As  the was a late evening flight (2320) we just  had to get  there and into bed as soon as possible. We  stressed this point to the crew and they were fantastic in making  that happen as  soon as they  felt permitted to set up the  cabin The config of First Class in BA is  4 with 2 aisles. This is  just as good as the Etihad First which has a central aisle with individual cabins  ( apartments) of  every aisle. Never the less the seats were fine  and flat bed ding if a  bit narrow. The  passengers were very  comfortable and did  NOT bother us until breakfast time.  Lunch was just ok with limited  space but this  was ok for us. The A380 is clearly the benchmark in long  distance First Class flight and on  this occasion BA  offered a high  class service.
5.0,"From Jose (Costa  Rica to Gatwick  by British Airways.  I was very unhappy with this . The seats  are uncomfortable. The  carpet was old and the tv  screens were scratched  and appalling to  me There were  NO drinks services  this whole 10 hour flight, not  including the 2 meals which were  cheaper than usual.  You couldn't get  off and walk , as the  boarding sign was  up for extended  delays I didn't  realise there was  no turbulence, I've had worse. The  lights disappeared for  short periods of time. British Airways are obviously running  for the cheap whilst trading on  a previous good . This is  terrible Compared to  their Dreamliner which  also has games,  wireless charging ports,  unlimited films and  video on demand  - this is  vastly inferior and  i will never travel BA again."
5.0,"Heathrow to Bangkok  with British Airways. Fast check-in by  BA staff at  the The Galleries  it was as  they were busy , seats were comfortable and the food ok. Boarding  started approx. 50  mins before departure  and boarding through ! Unlike most  on the Middle Eastern airlines we  are just pointed  at the general  direction of our  flight rather than  pointing to them.  This was an  empty 777-200 in  a 3 cabin  area and the  cabin was showing and while generally  good the trimming  is coming apart,  the IFE screens  looked small and  our seats felt  that bit cramped.  So much like  Virgin Atlantic's Upper  Class seat, these were great for  travelling normally or fully flat but  sitting in between was a struggle.  Overall the ying-yang  seat configuration is  uncomfortable to say  very least but  our centre seats  are great if  you travel as  a couple. Welcome  cards were eventually  made and we  took off only  slightly delayed. Dinner  started painfully slow  but it was  another good 3  hrs after take  off before dinner  had finished. Starter  & dessert were  good but the entree was far  to overcooked for  my taste. Also  there is no  dining on demand facility, you eat  when you are  ready when it  suits the crew. The crew were  attentive but painfully . It also  takes more than  an hour after  departure before the cabin lights were  properly dimmed. Breakfast  was served 2  hrs before landing  before the crew  was transformed. It  was a quick  but efficient service,  no shame it  take them 9  hours to get  at that point.  Breakfast was not  great but edible.  BA landed at  exactly on time  and no fast  pass cards for  boarding were given.  Food arrived on  our belt only  moments after we  had passed through , It is  clear that BA  have been cutting  back in their  crew cabin and  that shows in efficiency when compared  against the Middle  Eastern 3, the  European airlines and  even the US , They could  learn from cutting  the very generous  fuel allowance and use the money  spent on fuel on getting a  better hard product ( and cabins)  or improving their  hard product (food,  service etc), especially  for their current  pricing point. Based  on reviews here  BA had set  my expectations of  them low and  it was still  disappointing"
8.0,"I flew Melbourne to Singapore via Sydney on 1  July with British . Our preferred  flight is Etihad  and we decided  instead try BA  where we secured  a very competitive  economy fare. I  have never flown  here before but  had heard not  so good reports, so was a bit apprehensive. We were delighted with  excellent service from  British (BA flys  independently of SYD) in Melbourne in  getting our bags  over to Singapore.  Jet boarding in  Melbourne was very  easy and we  felt warmly welcomed  with the very professional cabin crew.  Our 777 First is a 1-2-1  cabin and we  loved the centre  lounge with the  pat down privacy ! Departure (1500)  was on time , the 9  am flight up  from Singapore was  extremely smooth. Cabin  crew were very  helpful and attentive. There was ample room to stretch , although we  could not makeup  a sleeping option , we were  allowed in Singapore  and go on  an LHR. The  service was lovely  and was the  selection of wine  and drinks. In  all we were delighted with the  accommodation and flight."
8.0,"Early morning flight to Amsterdam from  Chicago A complicated schedule cause a  slight stir at  first but check-in were woderful this  year and did  well at most  minimal assist. Straight  off the plane which was an  old B-767 with  a 2-2-2 configuration  and business class. Crew professional and  the choice between  please meet or  learn english for  breakfast Full served , cabin cleared in the 50  minutes the flight lasted. Despite a delay out of  Chicago we were  back on time in Amsterdam. The  cabin was crying out for a  nap but otherwise a good flight."
8.0,"San Jose - London Heathrow -  San Jose in September 2016 in Premium Economy. Was so excited when British Airways announced the new San Jose service earlier this year. Driving  from the 101 to SFO had become a tedious task with traffic getting more and more congested. So was relieved to  get out of SJC, a ten  minute drive from home. My only one gripe with BA is not being able to select a seat at time of booking without paying an additional fee which should not be necessary in  premium Economy. Night before travel, I was unable to select a seat during on-line check-in, so next day I proceeded to the airport only to be told  a seat was available due to over-booking. Was provided an $800 compensation credit card to  spend the following day which I gladly accepted. The  BA 787 is a beautiful quiet airplane and a  nice choice of aircraft for this route. Was given  champagne upon boarding and a hot towel. Only one drink service after take-off and only one shot of whiskey was provided. Dinner service included a choice from the Club World  cocktail menu. Full  course breakfast prior to landing. Return  was given glass of champagne upon boarding and hot towel. Lunch was a Filet of Beef. Mid-flight snack  bar was a let down and afternoon tea included a pizza. Cabin crew were OK and nothing exceptional on both sectors. Overall a good trip."
7.0,"Flying to Porto , Barcelona to Gatwick a week  ago with British . Both flights  on time. While the seats are  above the cabin , and the  ground crew professional, the service has  actually been minimized.  Just one quick drink run (tiny serving) and a small snack (tiny bag of crisps or biscuits), nothing ! They even missed several rows when handing out the snacks and  we had to  return them. Crew spend most of the time arranging things in the  plane Maybe it's  time to start  preparing food for purchase?"
5.0,"Flight to Boston  and London. First  time flying BA , flying Qatar,  Bahrain and Oman , business class.  Checking in at  BA was quick  and efficient with  two seperate business  and first class  seat in area.  BA uses the  economy lounge, which  is basic but  comfortable The flight from BAH to  BA was on  Boeing 777. The  rows are in  a 2x4x2 configuration  which are very narrow (similar to  the economy seats,  but marginally larger  in the economy , though reasonably . When fully  occupied there is  too much room,  so people over  10 feet will  notice There was hardly any storage  space and the  LCD screen was  too small and  in poor quality.  The food was  only average (I  liked the carrot  / pumpkin soup).  the crew was  young and the  crew felt old  or tired. The  bar in Heathrow  was large, but  was too busy  to be able  too sit comfortably.  The bathrooms in  all the main BA lounges are  quite dated and  require a good  smell far more  comfortable then they . The quality  the food in  each lounge is  poor though the  wine and spirit  here is decent.  The flight from  Dubai to BOS  came on a  747 and this  was similar to  the 777 -  slow and tired  with cramped seating  in business class.  The crew were a bit better  in this leg,  but still disengaged. The food was  of average quality,  and the wine  selection while small,  was good. Overall,  BA has the  look of a  British carrier compared  against some of  our middle eastern counterparts. The lounge  was sub par,  especially when compared  against the Qatar  lounge in Doha,  not even the  One / One  class lounge in . The business  flight ticket was  very cheap, though  I can now  see why. Given  a choice I  will not fly  it again."
8.0,"From Gatwick to  New York JFK  on British Airways. Check in at  gate is a complicated, slow process  but once through security things get better. I dislike  their business class  seating layout. Old  fashioned very worn out seats with little or no  cushion but the  amazing cabin crew  make up for all of this.  They were going out of their  ways to serve, to make sure every passenger was comfortable, well fed  with plenty of drinks. Food was  served Flight on time, but arrival at JFK is  one long immigration  process etc."
9.0,"We flew from  Malta to Kos on Tuesday 13th  January departing at  midnight As the flying time was  between 3.5 and  2 hours long,  I had contemplated flying Club Europe  as with identical  seats to the economy seats, it  would seem worth  my money. We  flew in around  5 and having  just paid to  get our seats, everything went smoothly  as most of  Terminal 5 seemed  pretty quiet. I  had tried to  figure out in  detail what food  if any) might  been offered on the flight as  we would have  rather not eat  lunch at 06.00  at the terminal.  However despite knowing people that work  at British Airways,  this seemed quite  limited as the  web site is  very ambiguous. Having  explained that, I  should find out  if the food  menu depends on what band your  flight is classified  under but try as I may,  i couldn't find the LHR to  order on any  of the bands. In the end  we had tea  with toast at Gordon Ramsey's which  is expensive but  a lot quieter  that the other outlets serving breakfast. Boarding was on , although we  did have to  take a bus  from somewhere near  hour three which  arrived around 10 ! The plane  was little more  then half full which obviously speeded up boarding and  I left a  minute early. The  flight crew were  very friendly and  accommodating and we  got offered a  banana and a  coffee for breakfast,  it was fine. As we had a spare seat  on our row  for three, it effectively meant that  I had the  allocated space as Club, which made  our flight a  bit more comfortable.  Having arrived a  little early in  London after a  slightly bumpy landing  where we were  in customs and  received our bags  in half an hour. Overall a  good flight and  airlines must have  a tough job  filling their Club  style seats unless , course passengers  want to, pay  hundreds of pounds  and lounge access  or a hot  flight"
8.0,Flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. We enjoyed the flight very much on the A380. We chose two seats together and it  was comfortable. The inflight entertainment was  great and had  a fair choice. The food was ok and there were plenty of drinks to go round. Staff were  friendly and helpful.
1.0,"The husband and I flew from Atlanta to London , it was a nightmare experience. First the flight  got delayed of  2 hours and since we had to make a connection in London to go to Geneva, we only had 45 minutes do so and it was a nightmare. No one to helped us, we had to run like crazy in the airport. We had to pass security and immigration one more  and we finally  did it but  our were the very last ones to board the  flight to Geneva  as it was about to close is door. I was shocked that  UK Airways did not provide us with any assistance, obviously they do not care about their customers. On  our way back,  another flight from Geneva to London was late by more than 40  minutes and we had to run  again in order  to catch our flight to Atlanta. We flew in premium economy that does not even have its own bathroom, when you are in premium economy, there is only one bathroom for about 150 people and it is a shared  toilet with people in economy. The food is non existent, one ounce  potato salad and four once of  a ""so-called"" meal  plus dessert and  one coffee. You will be left  hungry so don't  gorge on their food because it is more than a huge disappointment. We paid $3800  in this trip and I regret choosing this airline. Premium economy is not worth the extra fee, you only get 7 inches more than in economy but  damn it. You will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than  in economy. That's it.  I  will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested  in make a flight connection in London Heathrow, please make other arrangements as it is a huge airport and British Airways flights are late. The only positive thing I must mention is that employees on the plane were very gentle, polite and  willing to talk  with but other than that, everything else with British Airways was off.  Neither worth the price nor the headache."
1.0,"We flew from  Downtown Atlanta to  London Heathrow on  May 2nd, and  I have to  confess it was  the worst experience  I have had . When we  walked onto the  flight there was  NO room for  any of our  blankets at all , we had  only put it under our feet,  bearing in mind  that was a  6 hour flight.  as uncomfortable as  it was I  knew I would  actually get some sleep, when I opened the blanket  there were long  white hairs stuck  into it. The  covers were ripped ! When the  sun came out  I didn't get  a one, 2  hrs into the  plane I asked  a lady for a mineral. I 'm still waiting!"
8.0,"Gu Dhabi to London. British Airways is usually a very organised airline.  I do have  some stuffiness and it irritates that  you need to pay for selecting any seats, even  when we fly Business class. This is something that  BA and every  sane person, would consider as utter madness. I did  indeed pay a  fortune and managed to get an aisle seat for my AUH-LHR leg on my trip.  Everything was chaotic although this is  not to do with BA but  rather the airport , Staff were  friendly and efficient  when we landed ahead of time.  Upon departure we were given a  small snack and  on arrival a full English breakfast. Overall a comfortable flight."
3.0,"From Heathrow to New York JFK.  The poor service  is beginning to . Cabin interior  is tired and  our media screen  was tiny. Food  seemed ok but  we had one  drink and were  later told there  is no beer left on the  plane Asked three  other attendants for  a drink later in the flight , only one  person bothered to  answer - and that was to  explain there were no drinks left.  Food on the return flight was  no better. I 'm planning a  first class trip  in Thailand in November and I  think the Emirates  ticket is £550.00 less than BA. The British Airways  flight is again a Boeing 777-200,  they are now  older and outdated , the Emirates  are all A380 or 777-300ER, less  than 5 years  ago with the  latest up to  date entertainment and  all in flight service. And they  offer a chauffeur  driven car to take you to  the airport! -  Why would anyone  use BA if they had a  car"
5.0,"Left Heathrow to  JFK return. Outward leg was full. Seat downstairs on  middle aisle. I am tall and  this is not  great leg room. Plane was clean  - crew efficient. Evening meal of  chicken and rice  seemed passable. Departed  and landed on  schedule - I was actually en route to Botswana  - time to connect with that flight. Return leg  was not full, seat upstairs and  it seemed quieter.  No passenger in  middle seat so  he had aisle  side window to  open but the arm rest between  our seats only  took up half  that - seems  a BA design  was and is . This crew seemed to be in a race  and complete the  food service - again chicken and  beef (5 days after outward trip) and not as  fully prepared. The  flight crew were  told to serve coffee in the  back of the  meal in order to disappear as  quickly as possible.  They reappeared at  dinner which was the BA version  - a ""full "" as it  was on the  outward trip -  bright yellow which  appeared to be  uncomfortable but the  food was OK.  Landing on time.  The crew seemed younger than usual , maybe they  need a senior  manager point out to them that  all the serving  and meals is  not obvious and  is what we  paid for."
3.0,"Ab Dhabi to  Uni return. Probably  one of the  worst flight/travel experiences  myself and my family have had  too endure! From  What was supposed to be a  special occasion for  us as a  group taking our  kids to the  US to get  her into university , into an  airline that will make sure that  they never fly  UK Airways again.  Sadly when checking  in in Abu ja the flight  was cancelled due  some technical problems  with their new  Airbus 787. Of course flights get  delays and we  can understand but  I was rediculous  at the total  absence of communication. Passengers stood around  2 hours with  no one knowing  anything was going  and eventually a  check in clerk told the passengers  they come back  The next day  around 10 am  to check in. The actual flight  out was 14:00,  however the plane  was delayed yet again. British Airways staff were no where to be !! Eventually a  new British Airways  plane arrived. We then couldn't check  in because the  machine was broken,  After an hour  later decided to  finally check us  in and we  flew away to  see our daughter  off in Uni.!  Finally at Heathrow,  two hours to clear customs because they were short . Then on to collect bags , to find that my daughters  backpack for Uni  is missing, apparently  she made the  flight and no  one knows where  he is. Again  zero communication from British Airways despite  multiple calls to  them each day , the crazy thing is that  we have to  repeat the story  with every service  desk person that  answered the phone.  Crazy thing is  that in the  trip to Uni  we had packed  a few sentimental items into her  check in bag,  and we explained  this to the BA phone operator,  and was told that was probably not the wisest decision. Thank you  everyone for the great advice. Now , on the  train returning to  UK to Abu  Dhabi (same plane)  2 days later  when the plane  was delayed again  thanks to hydraulic  oil leaking from  an engine. Great  flight found the  plane But a  NEW plane all  new problems! Seriously  UK Airways, should  do not test  your new aircraft  when you haul  them around the world.

2.0,"Gatwick to Malaga. Aircraft on remote stand at Gatwick North Terminal requiring a shuttle transfer and  boarding via steps without  windows - not bad this early  on as just overcast but dark and chilly waiting to board. Aircraft in poor state of preparation with stains on back  and seat leather and generally dirty. Pushback delayed due to late arrival of passengers who missed shuttle. 40 minute delay in departing due to aircraft movements volume that lead to two female passengers having argument that  lead to CSD  decision to return aircraft to stand with one passenger being moved. Well dealt with by  the staff. Very noisy group of  friends on golf holiday in seats  on rear of row 21 who  had alcohol the  entire journey becoming very loud using  vulgar language - spoken to by other passengers and  asked to desist. The food just gets worse each  time I fly with them - muesli high in  salt and cheese , tasting worse than cardboard - is this really  they best they can do? Finally to round off flight, a very hard landing to  finish one of the worst short haul flights I have ever taken  on BA . The staff great but product is  poor"
1.0,"When a flight  departing at 18:55 , advertised snack  consists of a  packet of crisps,  a two biscuit pack, or a  very small packet  containing nuts. These, and a drink  in a small  tea cup were  sold with no  indication possibly the  airline crew were  confused by the  lack of anything  more substantial. British  travellers need to  consider whether to  buy food offered  in short haul  aircraft or to  use reasonably priced  high quality snack , as do  at low cost ."
8.0,"This way, London  Airport to Amsterdam  on British Airways.  London itself was  Easy Food tasty  and staff friendly.  It is a  long flight and  our flight attendants  have a lot  of do in  such little amount  in time, so  I can be forgiven for being  somewhat hasty. The  only complaint is : incredibly crowded ! Lockers in the lounge would  be a great  addition especially for  business travelers."
4.0,"Flew from London Heathrow to Seattle. Poor boarding procedure at T5 with the indicators suggesting  plane was not ready to board but on arriving at gate we walked straight on,  joining others who were waiting and seemingly not sure whether to board or not. Econ seemed about 75% full. Sat half  way down but  with no choice  save for main meal which was served after about  4 hours of  taking off. Cabin crew very apologetic  but blamed management for recent cost cutting measures, saying  it is happening a lot and  upsetting many passengers. Travelling with 3 children who didn't like the only  food offered, so much frustration with British Airways taking a budget airline  approach but charging all full service price. Complained to Customer Service after  arriving home and was told the  crew at LHR was to blame and they didn't  have to delay the flight waiting  out the extra meals. Seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to  anything the crew said. Crew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my  cabin which was highly appreciated. Hard to recommend BA but given the competition on this route, and the desire to stay with One World/BA FFP, it's a poor choice."
1.0,"London Heathrow to  Manchester It seems  British Airways has lost so much of its traditional customer base that  is turning into a budget airline at scheduled prices. I only fly  for them now when tour operators give me no choice. Ground staff  are the now usual bunch of  well worths, refusing to change my  seats because ""that's  all the computer has allocated"". Boarding was the now expected shambles. The no checked baggage fare option results in so many  small bags being carried on board  that overhead space for small cases is at a  minimum On this flight several were removed from lockers, and the owners rudely told to put them under  their seat in front, thus severely  reducing leg room. Cabin staff were rude and uncaring. Again now the  worst for BA.  Only in flight snack was a soggy croissant and a small plastic  bag of tepid stewed tea. The seats are very narrow, allowing minimal room a no  communication between neighbouring passengers."
1.0,"I am a  commercial traveller on  several airlines and  frequent One World  Airlines FF. British  Airlines flight BA632 from LHR to  London on 11th  May was by  me the worst  flight crew that  I have encountered  in 45 years of flying. The  crew had no  concern in the  number of passengers  from Business Class,  but were more interested in chatting with each other  in the galley ! After 1.5  hours in the  cockpit we were offered a drink,  a champagne was  served and the  crew gave me  some gin and tonic. After that  we did a meal service and served a fish  dish that had  been overheated and  so was inedible.  This was all the service we received on the whole flight of  4 hours. No  pick up of  passengers no offer  of water, and  in the cabin  they spent their  free time in  the galley eating  & talking. I  then went out  and asked them  were there any  service on this  plane and received  no reply"
3.0,"Gatwick to Bilbao. British Airways migrating to southern terminal and it causes a chaos. Everyone is used to flights being constantly  delayed in Gatwick, however with silver tier membership or flying business one expects to wait in a BA lounge. BA does not have a lounge now, instead they are using No 1 lounge subject to capacity. And when 5 flights are delayed,  their is no capacity even for business class passengers. Does BA ground staff care about it? The ""computer  says no"" attitude prevails together with the usual BA familiarity and ""sorry"" that means nothing. Try to be more professional and  show some respect. Now the customer  experience is non existent and no one cares about anything. If I want no frills , fly easyjet."
6.0,"BA club Europe,  London Heathrow - Istanbul - London , over a  hour check in  was T5 quick as was priority , used the galleries South lounge  which while very  crowded was okay , a few  decent food options  available from the main terminal. Boarding  back on to a pretty old  aircraft however seat  very clean and  comfortable departed a  tad late but  made up the  experience with on  the arrival. Crew  were good, friendly , chatty, one  if BA's assets,  food served was  very nice lots of drink runs on the 3hr  delayed flight. Check in on the  flight again quick , was the  last security lane . Istanbul Ataturk airport is not  a favourite its crowded & dirty,  the lounge used  for BA is  some of the worst! Not worth  the trouble of finding. Boarding through  gate 209 organised seat 3A old  but clean and comfortable 767, departed  within 1 hour  very good food  & service from a nice crew,  good LHR on  arrival although the flight arrived on  to the furthest  away gate and  boarding (Not BA's !) took so , with huge  delays which meant  another 1 hour  waiting landside. Good  experience Will continue  on use British  Airways if the  timing is right."
4.0,"Madrid to Perth via Singapore. So  frustrated with BA. Really useless airline.  Was delayed on  arrival to London 3 hours and no reason given. Missed connecting flight to Perth from  Singapore Was given  free lounge access , this was  better than nothing but I wonder why they couldn't 've just given me access to  their lounge. I decided to give  BA a chance  by avoiding BA/QF flying between Australia and Europe but I never will … Pay to  reserve seats? Pay  or request meal? I guess BA  was positioning itself as a budget airline, but its price doesn't reflect that yet. It's a shame as I enjoy the transit through Singapore rather than the gulf states. Meal service was alright, food good, and  bathroom service also okay but they  sat in the galley most of the flight and didn't serve drinks. They were quite  an cheerful bunch at least. Check in process was smooth all in !"
1.0,"Welcome to London  arriving with British  Airlines in First Class. The boarding process at Miami was chaotic with  a staff member inviting World Traveller Plus, Club World and First Class  members all join  the queue to board. Despite flying First Class it  was 15 minutes  to get to the front of the queue and a further 10  minutes on the jet bridge before getting onboard. The  staff were indifferent  as we were not escorted to our seats. The ""hot"" towel service before take off  was a cold  plastic towel which had not seen any hot water. The ""hot"" nuts were served 10  minutes after the drinks. The meal was dry and  of poor quality.  The cabin crew forgot my partners main course and put one in the oven 30 minutes after everyone else had eaten and when it was served, it  was cold and  wet When the  team member made  my bed up I was informed  we had ""run out"" of duvets  but the crew  only managed to  find one after  he complained about the poor experience to the CSM.  Overall on this  experience BA's penny pinching across all of the cabins  has lowered the  value of all of the product and it is  definitely worth paying  for First Class  and save yourself  some money because United Airlines Economy  Class is better than what I experienced on this ."
2.0,"We flew as  a group of  five from Heathrow  to Krakow in Club Europe. The aircraft was clean and newish so  were the new ""economy"" seats in  the Club section.  ( would like  too know who at British Airways sanctions the use  of these tiny seats in Club I know its nice to have the middle seat  - but I  would prefer a  regular seat to  sit in - maybe BA should have a look  at Turkish Airlines Biz cabin!) The service outbound was just adequate - one drinks round,  with a dinner  plate (BA872) which was edible but  dumping / dumping  a meal out  in a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least.  Are the crew trained to do  this or was it just bone idleness not to  put the meal in the galley  or serve to  another passenger? In all, the outbound  service was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating. Now for the return ... what a  nice Nn lounge at Krakow - that's right you  hang onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and  get quiet! The flight was delayed  for nearly 3  hours so by the time boarding  came it was a scrum (priority boarding abandoned) to get through the  gate as most  people were so fed up. British Airways prefer not to pay for  wheelchair access to the plane so we were then  off to a nice ride in  that old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up  passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits. Once  off the plane the same tiny seats, although we  were winners all round as we  went to bag  2 and 1C so at least we had some  breathing room. The meal service on  each leg really did make me . The steward offered a shriveled  potato salad (leg s skewers), or  like this, a boxed sandwich. I  just had to ask if that  was it? He replied ""yes"" to which I replied  ""... who's eaten  half the food?"" He laughed and actually said we 're lucky, and if I had any food with  us could he have some! And I'm not making this up. Once at LHR it  takes 1h for  the bags to turn up by which time the  bus service to the parking had stopped (and that  got into a  little drama but  i won't go there on this ) So -  what did we  get for our Club fare to Krakow? In my opinion very little,  although what we did get was : If anyone <mask> thinking of <mask> to Krakow <mask> BA my <mask> is save <mask> money and <mask> economy (with another airline), and spend the saving <mask> fun there. In fact choose another airline since <mask> on this route are just a joke. I <mask> been Club <mask> hundreds of <mask> over the <mask> 20 years and the gradual <mask> in the <mask> has now just about reached the point where <mask> I have used up my <mask> Avios it'll be Bye Bye BA for good. (I will only use Avios to get First long haul as that gets you the best return on them."
3.0,"London to Denver. Seat space   poor (I'm 6ft 2"" and really )  Film  quality poor, screen  time - poor temperature control, poor food.  Drinks  - Nothing in  relation to Emirates,  not Turkish etc . on par  as Ryanair at  least (Ryanair doesn't  have films but  drinks almost as  good but 8  minutes of this  long flight is  very painful). Better  go find another airline and route  if possible."
8.0,"London Heathrow to Cape Town. Check in at Heathrow T3 very efficient.  Use my card to access the BA Lounge at T3 which is pretty average, although enjoyed a good  meal with very  nice claret so did not need  much eat on  board Boarding a  whale of a  row at remote  gate 35 where both the PA and aircon were not working, but nonetheless everyone seemed  to be seated  for the inevitable  last passenger/bag offload,  this caused a 30min push back , Service seemed  good on board  although I did  NOT eat dinner)  and we had  one friendly young  staff member on our aisle. Managed  a get some rest and with  some breakfast before landing at CPT,  45 mins late. All in all,  excellent value for  money The usual hopeless British Airways  logo which needs constant re-sets and is from the  back of the ark."
5.0,"Flew London Heathrow  and Miami return with BA, then onto Bogota with  BA British Airways  had gone from being a very good airline to barely satisfactory. Not  once was the  flights delayed by  1 hour both ways, but due  to a baggage error they made  during the return  flight I only  just boarded the  plane on time.  In both flights  I ran out of one of  the food options, leaving only the  main dish. They  poor entertain system  of low quality , a small  menu with poor resolution. Seats were  worse uncomfortable than many other airlines  have flown in ! Their only saving grace is  a generous trolley bar allowance. I had connected from  BA to BOG with Avianca -  which are a much better airline. Seats were more  spacious and entertainment  systems of a  much higher quality,  although they had  been charging in economy. Shows how  much BA have  become when they're being outdone by the Colombian national  airlines If it  was for the better price, I 'd have preffered  the flights with  them"
2.0,"London to Johannesburg return. Still waiting for a reply,  after 6 attempts via email, post and phone to  get contact. On flight BA 0055 to Johannesburg the  customer service was  The worst we 've ever experienced.  We took off around 19h30, and were only offered a drink at . This was  my only drink  served that night. Dinner was served at 22h30, no drinks accompanied this. We were surprised to see we  was sitting in the back row of the plane, which was not what was shown  on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our  seats when we  made the booking. We did not have a choice of meals as they had run out, all we were offered was  this very poor excuse for a  pasta risotto, which was inedible. It  waited over an hour for the  tray to be cleared away. Breakfast was served to  our special diets around 04h30, waking the entire section where we were seated, then the  lights turned off  after another hour until we were  given an equally horrible breakfast. Coffee was not offered at all - the amount of  tea offered was below minimum requirements,  if we had  not taken our own water with , we would  not had a problem. When we  exited the plane it look like a rubbish tip, no waste had  being collected during  the flight, the  airline staff were surly and uninterested. Prior to this  incident we tried  and avoid the “back of plane” issues by paying an additional £56.00 for exit row . The payment was accepted and receipt issued via email. When we went to check  flights online our  reserved seats had been allocated again. When we arrived at Johannesburg airport we were told that the seats were no longer  available and had been allocated to other passengers. No  refund or explanation was given. Not  the way we  expected our holiday  to end. The service on this flight was as to be expected, regular drinks offered (water throughout the  flight the only negatives being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast. Cabin staff were very good. We have not received a refund  on the £56.00 paid for the exit row seats,  so I await  an explanation as  regards why these seats were not allocated to us. Even though we were flying economy, we expect a  level of service and edible food. If the back rows are to receive less or no choice on food and drinks then they should be charged less.  That is unfair and bad business practice. Upon speaking to other people who have flown with BA, the general consensus seems to be that only first / business class passengers seem to be valued, and our experience confirms this. BA were not the cheapest flights by far, we <mask> to fly with them due <mask> reputation, which was sorely let down. "
3.0,"British Airways is  even worse. Online  ordering in, what's  the point if  I cannot choose !  No  hot food on  either of my  recent flights (except !) yet the  airline still don't  mention this. Moreover,  although I asked  both a warm  drink as well  and a can  of coke on  exiting the flight  it looked like  BA was doing me a favour  in giving 2  tickets as opposed  as just one! At least I didn't take the  one offered to  me Always late  for flying in  & out of , which might  be due to  changing airport. "
4.0,"Flying Heathrow to  Birmingham I went  through the British  Air app on  my phone 20  second after online check-in opened, and totally disappointed to  discover only 4  seats available to  choose from. This  is the second time this has  happened with British  Airlines in the  same few months,  They really should  only be offering  an online check-in service if you 're given a  second choice of  seats selection! I  emailed them to  explain why they  do this, to which the reply  is that most  seats are ""restricted"" on online check-in. They did sort  a seat I wanted however as  was flying with  my Mother who  knows I want  should be sat  next to. Yet when I looked  online at the  possibility of paying  more for a  seating reservation before online check-in opens,  it was a  single choice available. If British Airways  do want to  pay extra for choosing a seat, and make it  nearly impossible to  find a seat  reservation for those  not paying, then  they should abolish  this online check-in as it's clearly  already providing the  value it should do - Online  booking means being  free to choose  among several seats,  and being unacceptably limited to 4 seat choices only, just 20 seconds  when online check-in  had opened!"
4.0,"The online check in is available from Dubrovnik so everyone checks in at the airport.  Parking in Dubrovnik is OK but  pretty poor, but better than being  at the busy  international departures area.  Our in bound flight was late and we were therefore late departing.  Not priority boarding. Cabin again not very clean probably because they were trying to minimise the delay! No newspapers available, when there are only  two rows in business you would thing BA could provide them in  their premium cabin. So called 'Brunch' was served, which was a few  tasty looking pieces of ham and  potatoes with a tomato, lettuce leaf and cucumber. Very  disappointing for what is scheduled as just under a  2 hour flight.  Looks to me  as cost cutting  thus far and not sure how BA expect to hold onto premium passengers who are paying a lot of money for their tickets. Cabin crew did nothing to stop economy  customers coming through  or use the toilet in business,  leave it that ? Very poor  service and think we will look at alternatives next ."
1.0,"Book a domestic  reservation from Knoxville to Atlanta for onward British Airways flight to Heathrow. Went to BA  for check in  and to be  informed that they  may not have  a reservation so  we needed to  raise it with  a travel agent.  All in staff  was bothered and  kept on being  rude Finally resolved  that issue after  nearly an hour  with the assistance  of my agent.  Flight in Atlanta was mediocre at  all Flight itself  seemed fine and  cabin crew were  extremely attentive but  they weren't anything  that I'd say . First Class  is average at  times when compared  against Emirates or  American Airlines. My  plane didn't arrive  before Heathrow so  had to go  thru the rigmarole of raising a  reservation with BA  and baggage - it was finally  delivered almost a  week later. Overall,  exactly the kind  customer service that  I would expect  when flying First  Class Raised a  question and received  no response after nearly three weeks  ( four follow  through calls to  public relations), who said that since  the agent had  cancelled my Knoxville  reservation that was  scheduled to land  at Atlanta less than 3.5 hours  before the scheduled  time for the flight to Heathrow,  their system ""automatically  canceled my booking ."" - I  dont know whether  this is normal  but I've never  come across this  company before in  ALL my years  experience flying. Absolutely  no customer service.  Prices have declined steadily over the  years and its  current offering simply  seems good enough,  Not to mention  its attitude towards  people paying for  its premium cabins,  that is atrocious.  Safe to say,  wont be flying  for them again . I can  handle it."
8.0,"London Heathrow to Dublin. On time  departures and on time arrival. Good  time and good . However, there are more cutbacks, no cooked breakfast on 06.45 departure, ham and cheese crosissant instead. The  two cups have . I managed to get another coffee from the Galley, and some biscuits. Still recommend  it"
6.0,"Last flight from  Moscow to Dubrovnik.  Check in reasonably  well although only  a desk at  first class check , New fast  and security was  the Number One  gate was busy  so we had  a reasonable choice  for seats, refreshments , On boarding , by the  back of the cabin, when lowering  the tray table  to the seat  down front on  board my seat , and my  Seat 4A, they were very dirty, nothing that could  probably be solved by a wet  cloth but not  clean enough. Hot  tub was OK.  Cabin crew were  really good. Flight  landed on time into Dubrovnik, but  our bags were  on the last  one so priority  boarding doesn't work.  A bit disappointing really."
4.0,"From Heathrow to Hong Kong. Very  disappointed by the  booking agents or  who was making decisions about seat  selection for BA 's service to HKG on September 10th. I was  buying my ticket  in April, so early. As BA  Member Club Gold  Member I had  reserved already then  a favorite seat on this aircraft , 51D on  main deck at time of buying the ticket. In AMS, when checking  tickets for that flight, this seat  was still granted,  but hours later at gate I  got reallocated to 14G on main  deck First no  comment then that they ""could make a family happy to sit together"", but they could  never tell me  if this family was traveling with  BA or not.  The other seat  changes due to  another full flight. Just the cabin service director was  happy to get  for a change to 13B, a  bit a little further away from the restrooms. But still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck. - I have gotten already 2620 EC tier  tickets this year and have little understanding for how  management treated me.  I am so  happy flying with  airlines they know my preferences: upper  right aisle seat and as much  center front as possible. I am  happy to give  up my seat  with families with infants or any  other person, but upon their reaction , guess this  was not the  case  Communication is marketing and  it was very  poorly done by  management this time!  But should I  be loyal to  this company which  is not respecting my loyalty benefits?  Especially concerning their  booking policy, that  passengers not paying  their reservation earlier on or booking late need to  make aware that they might not  get seated together!  This flight itself  was aside from odor and noise,  and the cabin  is very pleasant."
8.0,"Amsterdam to Heathrow. Swift checkin, security and passport control. Lounge with a nice view, but  it might have a little larger  drink and food selection. Incoming plane  waits for about 30 minutes, boarding for 20 minutes but on time arrival. Boarding process a little chaotic. Was moved to 2C, because on  that seat was  a husband of  a handicapped woman.  Was served their afternoon tea with sandwich and scones which was delicious.  Pretty comfortable, pitch on the small , Business class  public transport to LHR terminal 5 main building."
4.0,London to London.  Great time flying on this route  for BA and always boarding with  a minimal delay of 1 hour.  No snacks on  plane despite comfortable  & pleasant flight.  I recently started this route some  years ago with low cost flights  but the service does not meet the standards that  could be expected for a company  of its dimensions.
2.0,"Flight to London . The aircraft was fairly new (which made a  big change compared  with the many ancient long haul planes we've flown on with BA). We'll ignore all  possible reasons for the flight being  so delayed and  go straight to  our complaint: having left our hotel  quite early for breakfast we decided to wait for  the food usually  available on the plane. As we  never land until  noon we assumed  their would be some lunch offered. We were offered  no soft drink and the choice  between a bag  or crisps or  the bag of  sandwiches We complained  and were told  again this was  the policy on certain flights since  very beginning of  2014 What a  shame We regularly fly BA and  a silver card  flights however, we've decided to fly  our next two  short haul flights with Emirates. The  other planes we've flown on lately  are long haul flights have been dated and not very clean, and the standard of the food in business class has gradually declined in  popularity What other airline expects you  a climb over a strangers legs or to have  another stranger climb over your legs  to gain access to the aisle?  We can't keep  letting people up  you have no alternative but to  simply climb out!  the older I  am the harder this is becoming."
9.0,"we flew from  London to Porto . The flights were on time, crew on board were polite and helpful, the captain kept us informed  on both the outward and return flights. The cabin and toilets were clean. Porto airport was well run and efficient, Gatwick  Airport had filthy toilets was not such a pleasant  change "
1.0,"The many problems  BA had with  my outbound flight paled in comparison to my return.  Upon arrival at T3 from another carrier I went to the BA baggage check in  but was told that unlike every  single major carrier  at a major  European airport anywhere  on the planet, BA cannot possibly  take bags to my departure terminal,  however The agent  makes it clear it could be done but that  we would get in trouble. Fast  Forward security was woefully slow and  confusing When I arrived at the gate boarding had  begun Though I had purchased a  seat upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service I had received  on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items ; despite management's  public statements in their replies to  the earlier complaints  that ""Our hand  baggage allowance at  the bags with a 23kg limit  on the is also one of the most generous"",  and the fact that the flight  were not full  and more than half of the bin space in business class was empty, I was forced to check  the bag carry-on compliant bag. The  gate attendants were  clearly shocked about this and later  apologise for the  baggage agent's unwarranted behavior. The flight  was okay with  these same uncomfortable coach seats in  economy class and  an inedible food offering. In all a waste of money for BA's  premium business class  airline The recent Economist article about  their race to  its bottom service tier and the reneged promises made along the way speaks volumes about management's hostility towards customers and especially BA and OW elites. The asterisk on the Oneworld  Facebook page singles  down BA as  The only carrier in the group who will not  let it's own  frequent fliers and  passengers on OW  and have a checked bag on  the lowest and only competitive fare  BA offers. As the Economist article  states loyalty is  relatively easy to  lose but extremely  expensive to re-attain."
2.0,"Welcome to Moscow. I was supposed  to travel with  BA 233 today.  I had a  connecting flight coming  into Dallas which was a little  late As soon  when no one  met me at the arrival I  thought that I  was plenty of  room and did not rush to  my gate. When  I arrived to  the gate 5  minutes before closing  a lady said  the BA moved me to another flight because this  one was full  after my previous  was delayed. I  was really surprised  as there were  not lot of passengers still at  that gate and I was not  a last one.  She asked if  BA company will  reimburse me for  the cancellation because  we will miss another connecting flight  from Moscow. She said that the  airline will not  tell me anything  because it is not the company's  responsibility  After  that she said  if I am  still listening and  she will cancel  my next flight  the BA transferred  us to - BA 235. I  questioned why and  she said that  you should listen and then I'll . I listened , but could not understand few  questions still. Why  No one met me at the  gates if there  is a risk  for me being  cancelled Why she  explained that the  plane was full,  that my place  is given to  someone else without  telling me. Why  not least she  will say sorry  only once and  continued to insist  on her version  because it was  not fault of  my company. Is  that really something  which BA treats  as a normal ??"
2.0,"Return to Cape  Town via Heathrow. The aircraft was  very old with  no TV screens,  no seats and  the air conditioning  system which settles  air on air .  Food was ok, nothing  special but when  food was served  everything was started  way too late  so by the  time the food  got served, there  was no time  they serve any tea and coffee. ."
6.0,"Vienna - London  Heath - Porto in March 2016 in Economy, VIE-LGW 2o minutes early,  but almost on time after a 20 minutes departure delay. Web-check did not work. After having entered all  my required personal and passport details  online the system informed me that “no web-check-in is offered for this flight”. Quite irritating, as this information could have been easily shown at the start of  boarding procedure. Having Oneworld Sapphire status , used the  new premium check-in counter and was able to score an aisle/window seat.  It worked fine with no lines but required to be at the  airport earlier than intended, as BA charges extra for  certain seat selections (even for a middle seat at the back of the plane). Boarding  for both flights  worked fine and  was free. Service  in the VIE-LGW  flights was rather  excellent for BA,  but cabin crew was professional and  on flight deck - as per usual for BA - great. Much  like FA’s on the LGW-OPO leg and again flight deck excellent. Full bar service on  all flights and a sandwich was  provided as well. BA uses a shared lounge in  Economy which is  to the poor  part rather small and cramped, with  few food options. However, the hot  drink of the  airline tends to be of good quality. Snacks and drinks fall in  a discount category. Lounge experience in LGW was very  disappointing BA closed  the own lounge  for LGW to give up the  facility for another airline’s lounge and  the pay-per-entry No  Parking Lounge, which  was so crowded , even finding a place to just sit down was a challenge.  All food and  cold drinks have to be ordered at the -  rather chaotic -  bar off a menu. Food is  not delivered to your seat; a  labour consuming process  for a lounge that is filled  beyond capacity. My understanding is that this arrangement will  continue well into  2017 before BA  opens up a new lounge. Why BA gives up its own lounge  service in its  home airport to accommodate another airline is beyond me. Overall solid experience  on the air,  although not so  much on the  plane Will consider BA for further  travel in Economy  Long haul, if fares are competitive,  I will avoid departing from LGW.  Except for business class, I have  avoided using BA a while ago  owing to the  poor seating arrangements  for both short  haul and long haul flights."
4.0,"We booked a flight from London  City (LCY) to  Amsterdam (GVA) for  my summer holidays.  My flight was  booked at 7:10.  we turned up  at the airport  and be met by a huge  line at check in After waiting in that for half an hour  we headed to  Amsterdam The airport  is packed with  people any where to sit. After  two hours it was time for our gate number to appear, but  unfortunately didn't. A mere 5 minutes  later the flight  was scheduled to  depart with still no information we  began panicking as we didn't know  our gate number  and we thought  they were going  to miss the flight. We found  later the flight  was in fact  delayed due to  some issues with  an aircraft, which  did in fact  delayed to Venice  in few hours ! Chaos followed , as we  also met other passengers travelling with  me who also had their flight  to Frankfurt cancelled.  Another huge crowd of people appeared at the help ! Luckly we were rebooked onto  another later flight  this was also  late by an hour."
7.0,"Wonderful service and  accommodations I flew  between London Heathrow  from Munich. The flight departed on  time and formalities  from the gate  was professional.

3.0,"I flew British Airways Club Europe, from London Gatwick to Malta International Airport. I don't know why we paid double the economy fare per person as the seats are exactly the same as economy class apart from the lavish table in the  middle of the 2 seats. You get a blanket, a cushion and nicer food than  economy and access to the lounge, which comes with  the Barclays travel  package anyway. I enjoyed the food  on the plane but my sisters friend who flew with us is a pescetarian which means she only  eat fish and not meat, so the crew said that's no problem and gave her a disgusting baguette with tomato, but she didn't like it and there was no other choice for her. Complete waste of money but I loved the chocolate  bar - the  best I've had. To conclude the BA club Europe  is a waste of money because the seats are exactly the same as economy class and your paying  to travel in  full comfort and luxury. The Club Europe seats are a joke."
5.0,"Fly British Airways from London Heathrow to Larnaca. Cabin  is excellent. Cheerful and helpful. Food and drink good.  Taken down by aircraft. Business class  tickets are identical to economy. Little  doubt IFE was  not working for  a whole plane for the whole  trip In any case IFE was  a small screen in the bulkhead  so no choice  in content. Business cabin is normally rows 1 thru 9 but was extended back to  row 14 meaning we had to share the two  toilets with economy  flight Flight left late but arrived almost on time.  Overall OK flight , the business  class is not worth the extra cost. Would recommend  it but not  on this route.  Passenger on outbound and inbound flight chaotic with priority  going to families with babies of which there were  NOT very many).

8.0,"I wanted to  discuss BA's Boeing  747 to Shanghai. The ground handling at Terminal 5 was very efficient.  A little surprised that we had  the take a bus to the  gate and walk  up the stairs,  although the boarding process was swift  - completed 10 mins before schedule.  My seats were  no disappointment, they felt slightly harder and more narrow than the seats on older Emirates  Airbus CX 777 or Lufthansa A380. Screens were a  lot smaller, legroom was about the same. BA doesn't spoil it's economy passengers here. The Boeing 787 is quite silent, but the A380 is even a bit  more silent during the flight. However, this is where the criticism ends. The plane was  good food was excellent. The best  aspect was the  staff -  smiling and helpful, and professional.  Overall the high  standard of the crew would be my reason to prefer BA over the competitors."
1.0,"Prague to Singapore via Heathrow with  British Airways. Not a good experience flying BA. Will never book again.  They allowed me to book a  return flight with  about 1 hour  20 minutes to  Singapore This is not sufficient time if you have to change terminals and especially if you have kids. We did not miss our flight but we had  ot run fast to make it with 2.5 year old toddler. There are no airport  taxis available so  be prepared to carry your child.  Prices below average, food was terrible  but not enough  for it. At  many destinations they didn't deliver our  bags"
10.0,Early morning flight  from Heathrow to Glasgow with British Airways. Check-in very easy via App.  Flight T5 was fairly busy but I was quickly through security. Full  and departed gate A19 on time. Cabin very smart with new seating. Service was very good with a  full breakfast which was very tasty.
3.0,"Flew British Airways from Phoenix to London Heathrow. I'm trying to research whether this is just the Phoenix route but this plane was ancient. The business class seats are dirty and ripped, the  security system is  broken and the  food for first and business customers is embarrassing. BA are the only airline to fly to Phoenix direct  from LHR, but they need a  serious rethink about the poor standards and condition of this plane. Next  time I will fly a different airline and transfer via Chicago or Dallas."
6.0,"Lisbon to Heathrow on British Airways. I booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when I went to check-in online the BA website said I had been sold a seat-only flight. The travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a  luggage allowance. I called BA and was messed around by their staff member. I had to pay an outrageous fee to have 1 bag of only 12  pounds fly in the hold with me to London. At Lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strike. The  departure board did not show the check-in area for the BA flights.  I had to find my own way to where BA check-in. I joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump. When other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the check-in agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuing. The check-in lady I dealt with was very pleasant and cheerful.  The departure from Lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seat. The cabin crew were very professional.  All departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was served. My seat was  very comfortable and the drop-down screens showed the route followed. Arrival was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Baggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many  passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bags.  Where things go well, BA is excellent. However, charges for baggage are outrageous and place BA in the same category as budget airlines. I give top marks to the hardworking and very professional cabin-crew though."
4.0,"London to Marrakech with my family for a 7 day holiday. First  time on British  Airlines Pros: Flight  arrival time Comfortable seats, generous luggage  - Easy online  checkout 24 hrs before. Pleasant flight.  First Meal -  Always thought they  could provide proper  cold meals i.e.  soup and curry. however, route London  and Marrakech (and  vice versa) only  one type of cold meal, sandwich  are served. Also , chocolate dessert,  cake and the  hot tea, coffee or drink is  provided Unfortunately I could not have  a meal as  we do not eat anything with added sugar. Toilets - Only saw 2 toilets which  looked rather over  sized and busy.  Bars - none. I expected seats  should be built-in  HD TVs so that kids could  be busy and  entertained This was like a no  pay airline. Thankfully  everyone had their  iPads with them. Staff - Okay,  they could be  way more friendly and approachable. A  camera would make  the difference. Return  flight - Airplane was bit dirty.  Even noticed crips  all tucked under  a chair. Overall a 3 star  flight in my  eyes"
7.0,"From British Airways  from Barcelona to London Heathrow. While the 767 is getting a little  cramped it was  easier to board  on two aisles  where there is  the better feeling of space. Luggage  bins are a  little smaller but  a very good job done of making sure larger  luggage on"" was sent in checked.  Service was good and it's nice to get a  break and something to nibble."
2.0,Flying to Belfast  on British Airways. Boarded about 12 am for 12.55 take off. After  the delay we  was informed there  is a technical  issue and engineers  have been called.  we were offered water or soft  drink initially. We  then took off  at 3pm which  means we had been sitting on  this plane for 3 hours during which time we were not offered anything at all  for eat. It  is quite disgraceful  from BA. Once  again we were  offered tea / coffee / alcoholic  drinks and a choice of potato crisps. Is this what BA has been reduced to? This airline definitely  any longer lives up to expectations  so I will not be flying  with them again.  at least with  lower cost airlines you can at least buy some food.
5.0,"I have to be upfront and  agree the flight from London Heathrow to Boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin ! Over the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I'm afraid it just can't compete , it needn't be so as the issues as  I see them are all resolvable. However, the return leg was like flying with Ryanair. There were only  4 people in  my cabin. There were no slippers, 2 of the  3 items I requested were, in  some words of the crew ""invisible"",  but what did  exist was verging  upon inedible due  the sauce being lumpy and near to warm. The chocolate lava cake  had no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food  on the same  plane is beyond me. My father  spent the entire  time having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. We were not asked  unless we wanted  to be woken  before breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be woken. There  was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving  this flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than  other passengers. Once we had disembarked the aircraft, it  was a further 25 minutes before  I could get in to the  lounge as a door had not  remained unlocked. Finally, we collect our  belongings which I  want to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. BA have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. When comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for  west and Etihad First for east bound, BA just  cannot cut the mustard any longer  I afraid. Such as shame as  our seats / bed are great,  so why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or  accessible from flight  after flight?

1.0,"Berlin TXL to London Heathrow with  US Airways. After purchasing ticket I could not preselect seat assignment despite having one world sapphire status. I called BA 3 times. The first 2 times the agents stated they would select my seat for me and later the assignments dropped out of the system. After the third call the agent emailed me and explained that due to my fare category and despite my status no preselection could be  made At check-in I spent more than 45 minutes online trying to pay the junk-fee for a single piece of luggage. Again I had to call BA 3 times to  get a bag checked onto my flight. 2 of the calls were to undo the  mistake that the first agent made  of applying the junk-fee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outbound. The second call was to get a refund and rebook the junk-fee. The  final call was to complain about spending 2-hours checking in and correcting BA's mistakes. I spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk fee. The BA lounge at TXL is small and does not have a toilet. There were no warm food items on offer. I did find the service to be good. Boarding commenced at the farthest  gate at Berlin Tegel from the BA Lounge. Flight was okay with minimal amenities. BA not only does not compete on price but amazingly, no longer competes on service."
4.0,"Return to London Heathrow. I fly  this route regularly and I have  no decline in  my BA level  customer service. Boarding  to Warsaw is   No priority  boarding rules enforced  when boarding started  by everone at  exact same time, no matter you  pay premium or  not a frequent . New BA  long haul seats are  not really comfortable (fine  for 1h flight  will get uncomfortable  again any longer). Same concerns meals . Crisps and  coffee with no  option of buying  extra food is  just enough for  the flight. I would rather cut  the free alcohol  or have a decent sandwich or a possiblity to  get further food  if necessary. On  a plus side,  the service very well trained and  experienced The WAW KI LON route is served with  multiple carriers (including  US ones) and  passengers will have  a time justify paying a premium  to fly BA  over this route  for the future."
4.0,"Manchester to New  York via Heathrow.  We were bumped  from a BA  Virgin flight from Manchester to London Heathrow and put on an American  Boeing B777-300 via . Whilst I  would agree that the staff on AA see passengers  like a necessary evil (particularly as  they were the lowest of the  crew in standard economy), the amount of room in their seat is  still far a  cheaper option than  sitting on the aging BA B747 ! The food  & drink served  by the AA  flight was also better than that served with BA. At least the coffee on AA came in coffee shop style cups,  unlike the feeble  plastic cups that  they provided, with  only 2 sips and it's gone drinks. I'm going  to be booking a trip for  my anniversary early next year to  Iceland which I  hope I'll book with Icelandair, as  this would avoid  another 20 mins  drive to the  gate and 20 minutes circling time ..."
3.0,"The British Airways experience has really declined over the past 5 years. I often fly business class and at least premium economy. The Boeing 787 is awesome. Clean, spacious and excellent technology/media options. However the staff and service has declined. Rarely do  the staff seem interested in their jobs - they are on automatic pilot. We travel with 3 children and the stroller has become a real problem. Firstly they gave a 5 kg maximum on weight. Try getting a 5 kg stroller that works in Canadian weather! So we bought a new Light stroller - however we have noticed extreme wait times to have the stroller brought to the gate after a flight ends. Try travelling with a 2-3 year old through the chaos of terminal 5 in the summer months without a stroller. With a tight 1 hour lay over we waited over 25 minutes for our stroller- the only reason we got it (ground staff forgot) was because the older and very caring pilot went down the stairs  alone to get it! The younger staff could care less and left us and 2  other families alone waiting. They could learn a lot from the pilot. Also every single  plane on our journey ended up leaving 1-4 hours late (a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it!). The good in the lounge and on board has suffered as well. Anyway, they have to improve. I fly with 5 family members every year to Italy - this time we are using KLM or Lufthansa - and another bonus us we can avoid Heathrow terminal 5."
4.0,"London Malta to  England First the plus points. Generous  seat and hand luggage allowance, even more so by being One World  Alliance member, which also allowed pre-booking of seats (including emergency exit row)  at no charge  of lounge access.  Thus far so good, but new  soft leather seats (whilst smart looking) are hard after  several hours flying without the ability  to recline. No  magazine apart from BA in flight Magazine and inflight  travel magazine. What  truly lets British  Airways down, though , the food and beverage service.  One (albeit fresh) sandwich and a drink. No tea  or coffee service and the crew fast became invisible after the meal  has been served.  Our flight was  full too, meaning that overhead luggage  allowance was at a premium as  any negative effects of a generous hand luggage policy  came into play.  For the basis  on this trip,  security has declined significantly since I last flew with  airlines offering a  more basic level of service."
1.0,"Philadelphia to London Heathrow with British Airways in First . Same issue as my last . I buy a First ticket , relax after a hard week's  work and BA has upgraded a  couple with small children, who eat takeout food in the lounge and disturb the cabin  of the plane. This situation happens repeatedly, so travelling  in First Class  on BA is a total wate of money. I can do the same trip on  other airlines that value their premium passengers."
9.0,Sat on the  return flight from  London to Boston . Premium Economy  or Business. Very  pleasant experience but  disappointing to discover  how my partner's  flight system would  not work. Mentioned  the problem to a flight attendant  who apologised when  we landed and  said that he had forgotten about  his Return flight  was in Premium  Class which was  fine except for  breakfast Every time  I travel with  him I complain  of the breakfast  but sadly to  no avail. No  fancy sweet cereal bars please.
1.0,"I booked the return from our honeymoon with British Airways from Naples  via London Gatwick, and due to the occassion, we upgraded to club class and also paid extra to  guarantee that we were seated together. Two weeks before , they decided  the split our seats (without informing us). I found  this when checking the Advanced passenger information that needed to be provided  that I obviously complained, explaining exactly  what the trip  went and how we had specifically paid extra to ensure we were  seated together as recommended on their website. Their response  was simply that they could not  change seats due  any operational or safety reasons - but wouldn't tell me why they had chosen to change our seats  two weeks before (only that it 's an operational . The customer services representatives were  absolutely refusing to look at moving any individual travellers,  but at the  airport were rude  & unhelpful. My wife is a  frequent flyer as  me so the stress and anxiety  has really ruined our honeymoon with my wife being  bored to tears the day before  she travelled. BA couldn't care less and wouldn't even  give me an  email to write to to complain.  Great customer service."
7.0,"Paris - Paris CDG return with British Airways. Bag  drop at Terminal  2 quick and  was free, checked  out online so had my boarding pass on my  phone Security was  closed at 13.00 but had an  ID so no . First time I have used BA in 5 years without having  been to the  gate through my  frequent flyer status  within the hour  at the terminal ! Boarding quick  and seat 7A was spacious departed  45 minutes late with a 10  min late arrival.  Very nice with  a drink and  snacks provided on  a 55 min  flight Return I  have no checked  bags so straight  from Terminal 2A , is a  great experience with  drinks and food , Boarding at  midnight for an  early departure on to a half full A319, departed a little late which meant a  late arrival in  Terminal T5. A nice flight, nice , a drink and snack provided.  Economy 24A with  great room. Pleasant trip for a  long flight, I  do feel it's  Worth the extra  weight for a  first class seat, economy was fine.  Could use again."
3.0,"Paris to London . This flight  started off and  landed on time.  The jack on  our new style  headset didn't fit  in the socket,  and if I  needed to listen  or anything I  had to sit  to hold the  thing in place. There was no  soap or toothpaste  available in the  small package left  between seats for ! The meal  plan before landing  were a choice  from a mini  burger or a  half mars bar.  A far cry  form the scone,  cheese and cream  from a couple  of years ago  – and even  worse than the  two mini breadsticks,  with salsa, packet  of mixed nuts  for 2 celebrations  from a couple  of months ago.  And even get  us started on the disgusting muffin  which has replaced  the salmon and  cheese roll as  my meal before  and on the  long journey! The  toilets were not  cleaned as often  a they should  have been and  we had to  tell the cabin  manager that there  are no toilet ries left. Very  disgusting"
5.0,"London Heathrow to Istanbul return. The outbound flight was delayed, (approx. 2.5 hours), which was  quite frustrating. Boarding the flight was another hassle in so far as we were bussed from the terminal to the aircraft and then there  were confusion around seating arrangements! Once we were finally off the ground, the onboard entertainment was great and the flight was quite smooth. The  meal was terrible, tomato and egg sandwich with other little tit bits! Return leg, was on time, but the check in queue was horrendous! The flight left on time, on board entertainment was a struggle as  they did not have individual monitors, and we were offered tomato and  cheese sandwiches again as a meal. I hope that this experience is not repeated in October on our trip to the Caribbean, but either  not I will come back to give an honest opinion. We will be flying Premium Economy so will expect to have far fewer complaints. Let's wait and see!"
7.0,"The flight from  Birmingham Heathrow to Krakow with British Airways was slightly  longer but arrival on time. Standard  first class service, nothing to write home about, but efficient. 5:30pm flight to arrive at 8:30pm but served  only a pack  and chips with a drink, not  quite a sandwich for this 2.5 hour flight. There is nothing to be purchased on BA. I believe this flight time should justify at least a sandwich that BA served on my previous  trip "
3.0," I was booked to travel British  Airways from Heathrow  into Dublin airport in Ireland. I  landed at the  airport within the  scheduled check-in times  but was held  off by a longer than anticipated  queue I went  into a check-in  / drop counter  but the staff ignored me for  a good few  mins as she  held a personal  meeting with one  of her colleagues. I was asked  the place my  bags onto the  seat belt and  show a boarding  passes and baggage  card The woman  behind the counter  then took the boarding pass back and after a  several moments I  told her if there was a  problem She nodded  then said her  security system would not let me  board as my bag had been  lost even though the bag was  placed on the  luggage belt and  she had issued  me with a  boarding pass. After  15 mins she  told me to  get my bag  or go to  a different area  and help. It  was bizarre. I joined a second  flight where a  more helpful man  realised that the first person I  spoke with had not checked me  in due to  error He made  another telephone call  but as my  arrival was delayed by almost one  minute he told  me not to  panic and to make my way  back through security  towards the gate.  This was not  happy One would  expect better from . The queue was poorly managed. The cabin crew  made one exception , frosty and  hostile One cabin crew member, an  elderly lady was  friendly and I  saw her help a young mum  and a baby  by answering questions  to 2 Japanese  men with limited  English This member  said the cabin  staff was a  female representative of her airline. My  bag was not  clean and there  were crumbs on  his floor. The  staff made very clear announcements and  their was a  big drop-down screen  to show the  location of the  flight A cup of tea and a small packet  with crisps were  delivered  My  luggage did not  come into Dublin with me and so I had to join a  courier for Swissport.  Here is where  my nightmare started.  A uniformed woman  that said she  represented BA told  me my bag  would “most likely”  not arrive until  after I asked  politely if the  luggage would be  on the next flight and she  answered no and  suggested that I leave the airport  and that a  courier would deliver  a bag to where I was . I took  her advice only  not receive an  automated email that  very evening to inform me that  my bag had  indeed been placed  until the next . Over the  next few days  the nightmare began.  We spent many  hours calling Swissport and their courier . To be fair the DPD  officers were helpful  they told me  their reference number  of Swissport was . Swissport insisted <mask> reference number <mask> correct. "
8.0,"London Heathrow - Vancouver - London Heathrow. First impressions could have been better as this flight departs from Terminal 3, rather than terminal 5  in Heathrow. The departure lounge was  normally used by  large longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to  watch the departure  lounge However the ground staff did their best to  handle the situation  and were clearly  resigned to having  to manage it.  When on board  also found the  cabin to be  extremely clean. Unlike  many airlines, BA offers economy seating  only on the  777 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter  then on most  commercial aircraft. However  low profile of  each cabin means  that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller cases. The IFE system  onboard is excellent. I also ordered one of BA's new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard  meal This option was well worth  giving up, offering an improved choice and quality. The  service provided by  the flight attendants  was friendly and professional and this is one area where British Airways  continues to do consistently well. If I have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch  was miserly for a 9-10 hour  flight Arrival at  London was on time and I  got through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes. Processing through security  for departure from YVR was equally  smooth The return flight offered a  similar experience to  the outward one,  and arrival in London was an hour late. However the relatively quiet  conditions on the  plane meant that I was able to get some . Unfortunately the  boarding experience at  London terminal 3 was no better than the departure . A lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having  you join a slow-moving, snaking line  to clear immigration. A marked contrast to the experience at YVR."
5.0,"Flew London Heathrow to Washington DC. The Business Class Cabin on a  US Airways A380 is unconscionably crammed with seven seats  each row. Most other international carriers I've flown limit  flights to no more than four, or, at most, five seats per row in Business Class. In the  new configuration, passengers  occupying the middle of each row are trapped in their seats if  a seatmate choses to extend their seat into a flatbed. Also, the  bags lack any storage space save a tiny drawer suitable for no more than a pair of shoes, and the seats are claustrophobically narrow. By far the  largest Business Class  cabin I've ever  seen"
1.0," I fly this route 3-4 times a year, unfortunately  there is no competition other than Air Canada. I've  experienced occasional problems  - rude staff,  cramped planes, poor service - but  always been satisfied.  On this last flight a week ago, the plane  has been internally reconfigured, and they  had placed large  plastic boxes in the foot area of every third  row that take up approximately 1/3  in the space, and fully restrict the movement of your feet and  of your legs for the entire  journey if you are a normal-sized  person I have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space - I offered to send BA this photo  but apparently they  were not interested  as they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint, see below. The discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of 1.5 hours  and for which I did not blame the airline - meaning I  spent 8 hours in that position rather than 6.5 hours. Then on arrival we in  turn learned that  the pre-landing snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar, approximately 2 inches in . As a  passenger I arrived  hungry and had  a go and eat somewhere after 10pm, and would  not brought food on the flight had I known of the miserly cost-cutting measure in  which I wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight, but primarily the lack  of foot space  because of the new configuration, as this can't easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again. I ended my complaint saying I had the distinct impression  the there is no respect for economy travellers. I've  now received a response which is clearly a cut-and-pasted  email about the 1.5 hour delay and completely ignoring  my content of my complaint, indicating that it was not even read, and confiming my impression that they  have contempt for the experience of people in economy.  It is particularly shortsighted, as some of us will soon be travelling in higher classes  owing to changes in our circumstances, and we won't forget how we  were treated.

10.0,"From Zurich to London Heathrow. Very friendly staff, great  selection of complimentary  beverages (even spirits such as Gin & Tonic, two  bottles of whiskey are included), flight was on time,  clean cabin. What I generally love about British Airways  is their cabin bag policy that  allow customers to bring up to two bags on board for free."
7.0,"On British Airways  from Boston to  LA via London. Pleasant flight, not  so comfortable as the plane flying  here in July, but still nicer than the old plane I'm used to flying into San Diego. The  TV screen options were much more  limited than I've  had before so I'm not sure if the different  screen made a difference or a  different plane. The crew were kind and unobtrusive. Food  is completely tomato-based which was very strange as usually they offer more  meat options. Overall,  pleasant flight."
10.0,"Flew London Gatwick  to Tampa. BA Club World (Business  Class is a great way to  travel Unfortunately due  the renovations at LGW, British Airways are having to utilise a lounge  and it wasn't  a restful as may otherwise have been but once complete I'm sure that standard will  have resumed. On boarding it was nice to be  welcome back"", a small but nice touch. Straight after settling into our  cabin came complimentary , warm towels and our menu choices. BA does a great filet steak and the  burgers were fantastic.  Part of the  thing I really love about BA is the fact  the they have a diverse age  range when it  came to their  flying crew. The  more ""senior members"" really do know their stuff - the things that  their experience gives you and this flight was no exception. Superb service  was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs  the were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks/ drinks are available  alongside the regular drink/meal service. The only downsides for  some are the  seat arrangement that  dictates that those  with window or centre seats have  to step over other passengers when those passengers are  fully reclined and  their IFE which really does need an update. I know that the  latter point is being addressed on the older aircraft. As an aviation enthusiast, a really big thing for me is that the flight deck crew are always ready to spend some time chatting  during the flight. BA! My airline  of choice"
1.0,"Outbound Heathrow -  Frankfurt on ancient British Airways 767  with old business  grade seats etc.. Aircraft was filthy dirty with wires hanging down. Why do they fly  these wrecks? Inbound Frankfurt - Heathrow on A319. British  Airlines have the temerity to call blocking out a middle economy seat with a metal  seat Club Europe!  These seats were  old and uncomfortable economy seats. The  cabin attendant was grumpy, rude, and sullen. I accept this was a short flight, but  how British Airways  got away with calling this Business Class is beyond ! They should be cited for trade descriptions. I  doubt if any BA senior executives bother to fly their so-called Premium Classes? 

"
2.0,"Dublin to San Francisco via Philadelphia. My international BA business class return flight was rebooked by BA to American Airlines. Instead of the second leg of the flight being the fully reclining seats with movies, electronics, and lots of space as advertised and paid for like my first flight, the second leg was a domestic flight which had a business  grade seat which reclined about 4"", no movies, no electronics, etc. as it was an older plane. It would have been fine had I not paid top dollar for all the amenities. I submitted a complaint and asked for a partial $$$ voucher but to no avail. The  airline service personnel  told me things  that conflict to  our conversations. The final straw was when I contacted my travel agent and had them call BA on my behalf. BA told them they would not refund anything because it  is a voluntary upgrade. Really? BA changed my flight , rerouted me with less amenities.  What is so irrating is the cost was over $4,000 for  one ticket and  BA was not provided the service or flight I paid for. False advertising."
3.0,"Flying to Amsterdam  and London with British Airways. Awful experience. My baggage is delayed since Tuesday 2 August,  They told me that my 2 pieces of lugagge  are going to  come the next day. I´ve been waiting and nothing has been received , I even  asked for the upgrated seats to  have a good  deal with my  baggage will be given, however everything has been very  frustrating My first  experience with British Airways has been  disappointing "
1.0,"I was flying Zurich to Baltimore via London with my cello and had booked one seat for me  plus an extra seat for the  passengers The booking was made online and then verified over the phone directly with British Airways.  I  told the BA customer support agent if the cello booking would be  accepted and he  assured me ""there 's no problem  because you have the additional seat booked, simply turn up at check-in and you will have no problems"".  But BA denied me boarding because their system required not only me,  but also the cello seat needs to have an ESTA visa! They were unable to distinguish between a passenger and a cello in their system. After 3 hours of stress at check-in they  refused me boarding and quoted me over $4,000 to rebook both tickets for all legs of the journey. I made an official complaint and  were replied basically  with no refund.  I am appalled my their total  disregard of customer  support and will never fly with them again."
8.0,"London to Sydney , on a  British Airways fifth  leg route. Boarding  of the outgoing  route (BA15) from  Auckland was a  bit disorganised and  some was congestion  on the aerobridge.  Before board the  crew had an  AC problem so  the cabin was quite warm. Seats  are fairly comfortable  and a fairly  high seat pitch,  so the entertainment  experience was fairly  good Bar service  started 30 minutes after departure. The  BA main meal  is pretty good  - would have  expected dinner to  have served 1 pm and not  2 hours into  a flight. Prior  to arrival I  had a snack  pack which contained  some really bad  tasting granola bar  & some yoghurt.  Cabin crew didn't  provide a regular  bar service on  this flight. Return ing to Singapore  service was a  bit better - boarding in Sydney  was done in  and more efficient  style Bar and  snack meal service  were quicker, although  evidence of BA's  price cutting can  been seen as they've now removed  cheese and crackers  for the main meal. Cabin crew  did do two  cups of drinks  each on this flight and were  quite attentive. Good sandwich for the  bar service before  arrival Late departures on both flights , arrivals into Sydney and Singapore  was on time.  So good to  hear they provide  food even during  long flights. Very  pleased with this  new flight and service, especially when  some full service  flights charge around  even more on  some flights and  their challengers aren't  getting to the  task with the  prices and service."
7.0,"London Heathrow to  Newark return with British Airways. Avios tickets for me and my wife. Great cabin crew  for both sectors,  especially the first as it was a day time flight so we gave them more  work do and  encouraged more interaction. Food was pretty uninspiring and the  wine list limited,  though we did manage to find  one that kept us pretty happy. Disappointingly they did  however have enough  drinks on the  first sector for  much other than a pre flight drink. Crew said it had been  raining on the  flight out and  they were unable  or replenish the bars at their  base (Grand Cayman). Lie flat bed , comfortable, flights on time and bags delievered to  baggage carousel fairly quickly."
6.0,Return to London  flight with British . Busy check in at MIA. This being explained by broken windscreen  of flight BA206 which led to their passengers being rebooked. Our own flight BA208 was  delayed by a damaged tyre which took 3 hours  of fix. The Admiral lounge at MIA was reasonable. The flight left late and staff  offered reasonable cabin service. Toilets constantly  filled by economy class passengers which left them less clean than usual and less readily available. Slept well on flat bed.  Maintenance was OK. They had to  replace 300 missed  arrivals as a result of the delayed arrival and  their staff seemed well prepared for this. Baggage damaged  (+ item) and lost (two items). I watched the ground crew at MIA unload the A380 from the gate after it arrived and I can state that in some cases they literally flung the cases onto the ground from the hold. I suspect this explains the matter.
8.0,"Doha to Paris  is via Bahrain and London, premium  flight is really  cheap The return  leg to CDG via BAH and LHR was $500 more than a  normal flight in Qatar economy class. Yes it also stops over in  Dubai and it's not direct to  Dubai but it was well worth it. Bigger seat, great food and better IFE than  when I could  from the emerald lounge at LHR . So landing  at Doha I can shower and  eat breakfast before  the short hop  for Paris.  I think there are plenty of passengers from Qatar willing to pay extra for premium economy rather than shell out for business class originating in Doha. BA will fly direct  from Doha in  next couple of months."
6.0,"South Paulo to Heathrow with British  First TAM lounge  in Guarulhos T3  was one of my favourites. Boarded on time, Seat 1K, cabin very empty, about 6 people in First. BA First Service  is fabulous, each passenger was welcomed and spoken to  directly by the flight manager which I thought was  another nice touch.  All BA 747s are all in  my experience quite tired looking. However  I will be sad to see the back of them when the  replacements arrive on this route in  next couple of months. The First cabin looks nice but it doesn't  feel like a First Class environment. The food was at best ordinary. The menu was not very inspiring,  one main course was simply dreadful,  fried chicken, the whole meal was not exciting as I would expect from a First Class dinner service. Very good wine / champagne selection. Inflight entertainment poor. BA have great  staff but prices are very high across all cabins and I am sorry to say on this flight it was not worth it."
7.0,"Fly to Kuala  Lumpur via Heathrow.  British Airways gets  criticised a lot,  so I get  it - they  do have the  best seat, they  must have the  finest food, they  certainly have the best cabins etc. They don't seem to be the  best at anything!  Their Business Class lounges in LHR  were often very  noisy the food isn't very good,  or they provide  a load of  beer pouring alcohol.! The Club World  Lounge on the  BA 787 is very nice place (although a bit ). The cabin design and atmosphere retains a feeling of class. In terms of the  Club World seat,  this has its critics, but I  like it! The separate footrest is one of the best features for  having a comfortable  sleep position, and  its one of the only airline  seats I can sleep in. This  could in part be due to knowing there aren't many things to distract you from sleeping such as a bar area  or a huge  library of films  and the IFE.  Menu wise, its  state o' affair. The dishes are ok, although you  only get the choice of dessert , cheese not both, how cheapskate!  I have always found cabin crew  should be experienced,  extremely competent and  willing to help - they make  the difference. I know when I  fly a BA , I will be looked after,  but not spoiled!"
7.0,"London Heathrow to Miami in Club World. Lounge at  Terminal 3 was busy and slightly cramped, with basic  drink offerings. Flight  was on time.  The Club world  lounge was roomy. However, slightly inferior  food service, for example no hot , no drinks , etc. Food quality was good.  However club world kitchen content was poor and inadequate,  and I visited  they had only  whipped cream on  board Seat comfortable ; slept well  when used as  a bed. Baggage  fine on arrival. Overall, a reasonable . A superior  when compared to  other American carriers.  Very inferior in comparison to middle eastern airlines."
8.0,"Flight to Kuala  Lumpur via London . The lounge in Athens was  terrible and the  chair was very worn and needed replacement. The first  leg to LHR  was on an  ultra basic economy  class for a  6 hour flight  was great, but  the meal was excellent and crew ed BA lounge at T5 is large and busy,  but plenty of  comfortable areas to relax. Amenities there  are fine and  in line with  other good airport  for Boeing 787-9 A KUL so  not new, excellent  facilities and service.  Reading some reviews,  I am a  critic of the  window seat layout  so go for  large window seats which provide excellent  comfort - once  a divider is raised!."
8.0,"The flight from London City to  London showed British  Airways (well, Cityflyer  in this case)  to its best. The plane was  fast and reasonably  comfortable the service was friendly and efficient and the food and wine were better than you would expect. It's worth noting that BA has no lounge at  all and the business-class seating on board is identical with economy. But if you fly  in on a good day, this is pretty much  the good as it gets for a short flight."
6.0,"I flew from Frankfurt to London  Airport on BA903. First everything went  well Check In  was quite fast and not very crowded and we  didnt have such a long walk to the Gate.  When we arrived  in the Gate (D6) they told  us our flight was delayed. Instead of 10.55 am, now 11.30 am departure time. The Aircraft arrived at 10.40 and boarding  started at 10.55 (the planned departure ) Because the  aircraft was parked at an apron , we had to go there by bus. The  cabin was OK , the aircraft hadn't been cleaned. They served crackers  and crisps so there were crumbs  flying around the cabin (from the last passengers). The  seats were normal short haul seats and ok for  the 1.30 hours . They told us the delay  was because the  electrical system in Heathrow collapsed. All in all the flight was OK."
10.0,"Flew from Leeds Bradford to London . So much  different from my  previous flight with British Airways which  is long haul.  Never fault the airline in any way. Cabin Crew extremely friendly and chatty, when time permitted, and very  tidy Aircraft spotlessly clean, and very generous leg room. Of the three different airlines flown  over this last week, BA wins hands down."
5.0,"Flight to London Heathrow with British  Airlines in World Traveller. Started badly  both at check-in  / gate boarding , Traveller passnegers  are made to  be second-class citizens,  but this seemed worse at Bengaluru  airport than Heathrow. The plane itself was packed to  overflowing probably because this is the  most direct carrier  for this route. World Traveller is a 3x3x3 configuration.  I had chosen  an aisle seat  facing the centre  ( 38D) at the rear to  minimize risk of  disturbance from other  airlines Leg room is actually pretty good for economy  and the new style of seat  provides plenty of space underneath. Seat  fit is OK.  My adjustable headrest is better than  those in Premium  Economy (World Traveller ), although the  foam base is  uncomfortable For a  10 hour flight I recommend sitting  with the cushion. Service was variable  and the VOD  for my seat  does not work (all I could  see was the  button and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt)  several times without ). Thankfully a  more senior staff  man was able  me find the only other unoccupied seat about 3  minutes after takeoff.  To be expected  be put up  on a seat without VOD for  3 hours is ridiculous - why do BA not check them after each flight? Plenty of food (breakfast  at 2hrs, in then a snack  in after 5hrs, then lunch after 8hrs) but, unfortunately,  although I thought  seating at the rear would mean  food served first, that was not the case, and  by the time  we got to my row all  food was gone.  Wireless connectivity in  the only earphone  and VOD choice  is limited compared to other airlines. Unfortunately I think  that British Airways have been overtaken  these days and  I look to  more Middle and Far Eastern carriers  in future."
5.0,"from Bangkok to  Dubai It's been  a few years  that I regularly  fly business class  at British Airways. I always used to look forward  to the big  with a boozy  night watching movies  or being treated a little bit ! Fast forward , the lounges  being generally borrowed  by other airlines  and make you  feel like a  first class citzien, the planes are  littered with worn  out interiors and  all of this  was reflected in  most passengers dissapointment  and a generally lack lustre flying experience. For better  value and added  value I've found  a premium economy  class must better  run for money."
1.0,"During our recent  Qatar Airways flight from Mauritius to  Singapore we decided  to pay for an upgrade. Only  we find when  you got on  our plane that  both seats given to us were  barely functional. We  got no entertainment on the 12  hr flight, no  connectivity to the  plane so could not even read.  Qatar Airways are  only willing to offer us a refund on the upgrade, as they  know their responsibility  was to get  customers from A  to B. The  audio system are all additional and  are part of the ticket price. Even though looking at their website  does state ""personal  sound system with  Bluetooth headphones"" as  1 of the  selling points for  boarding or flying  premium economy. The  reason that we did not even  have to watch  the security video  was not a concern to BA.  As someone who  gives BA a  lot they have just lost a  customer and do  NOT care. I  will avoid flying BA now. Terrible service."
1.0,"Flight to Lisbon via London Heathrow with British Airways.  Came in on  board but informed  as we were about to board  and there would  been a delay  of 1 hour. Once on board  this delay became  over 2 hours and we missed our connecting flight  from Lisbon. Were  put on the  same flight but  would not get seats together in club Europe despite  the high fare paid. The ""meal""  of 3 sandwiches  on a stodgy  bag Arrived in Lisbon several hours . Pathetic. No  one in London  would tell us  what was happening  when we arrived  to the terminal  departures lounge."
1.0,"Jet Airways ruined our holiday. We had a flight from Edinburgh to  London via Heathrow booked and the  flight was 70 minutes late in arriving at LHR.  So we missed  our connecting flight , when we approached the BA  passenger service desk  seeking help, the  customer service advisor was disinterested, smug and extremely unhelpful. He even said he was doing me a favour  by booking another  ticket "
1.0,I travelled from  BA to Heathrow  and on to San Francisco with  no issues other  than very poor ! Even less legroom than on a local flight  from Europe (Ryanair)  for a 10 hour flight. On the return journey the first flight  from San Francisco to Heathrow was  horrendous Once on the plane the  flight was ready  to go when  it was a  slight delay because  our gate staff  had somehow mixed  in the boarding passes and had  the discrepancy. So  BA had to physically check several passengers to make  sure they were  where they said they were. Very  confusing in view of the security  situation Then our  row of 3 seats had no  personal entertainment (row ?). The first  gate attendant we  talked to fobbed  him off for ages and eventually  admitted he could not fix it.  So the next  turn up flight attendant tried and  changed the flight  and came to  meet us and offered us an  alcoholic drink. So we travelled for  3 hours with  little entertainment. On  arriving at Heathrow  our next flight to Aberdeen was  again delayed for one hour. On  arrival to BA  BA eventually replied offering us a voucher for 20 %. Not much  use if you  want never to  use BA again. Shocking customer service.  To Heathrow and  no BA at Heathrow.
4.0,"They spent extra  to be upgraded  from First to  First from London Heathrow to Dallas  Forth Worth. It  was definitely not  cut it. The  cabin has smaller  First class seats,  and have expanded  in number of  passengers too. There  were now around . Cabin crew were young and  often without enough . Quite unhelpful , it took  so long time  people get meals  as they have  been ""taught"" to do everyone individually.  That doesn't work  if they have  reduced the number  of passengers. Cabin  crews clearly felt  the only responsibility  was to feed  - They disappeared  for lunch for  24 hours -  then it was  better for tea.  There is now  one meal less adequate than it  use to be  Breakfast Club. Further,  Business Class food  is far from  business class. Fewer  seats and what  is provided is  not good. Very  busy First Class  to BA used  not be restful  and the food  was decent."
10.0,"From Heathrow - New York JFK, BA115, First seat  - It was  slightly strange to be bussed to  the aircraft rather  of using an  airport but this was due to  technical issues. I was greeted at the steps of  the aircraft, taken  into my seat, handed pyjamas and  my wash bag and a glass  with champagne. The  aircraft was the  Sky First with  the Panasonic entertainment system, I was  recognised by name  throughout the flight,  got extra food  would try as  this was a  very full cabin, regular top ups  and drinks, and  had a stellar service from a  customer and professional . The new entertainment system was  fantastic and the  waiting for you  luggage service worked as my items  got delivered to my seat. One of the best  seats I've had for a long  time but I always believe it's  down to the service."
10.0,"New York JFK - London Heathrow, BA174, Club World , 62K. If  we are travelling Club World with BA, the upper  seat on the  flight is the  cheapest option for that ""private jet "". Seat 62K is a great  option with window  for more space  and no one  watches over you.  The food was very good and the entertainment system  was the new  HD version with  lots of choice  to improve sound  & picture quality.  Everyone managed a  couple of hours sleep as it  was a relatively  quiet flight."
3.0,"Basel to London Heathrow with British  Express At 11.30am I recieved a text telling me that flight BA755 departing 18:10 had  become cancelled. 70  minutes later, I  received a second message telling me that I was rebooked on flight BA749A departing 21:55. On arrival at Basel airport, I discovered the club class check in doubles as a general enquiry point.  Following a wait of 30 minutes whilst a stream of economy passengers' queries were dealt , a rude and unhelpful agent checked me in.  I asked if the seat 2C,  who had prebooked on the cancelled flight was available and was told no, I had been allocated seat 3C and the allocation could not be changed. Seat  3 remained empty. The business lounge was at least  identical to the BA one I used on my outward journey, being  well run. Our  arrival flight for BA749 was delayed leaving Heathrow finally landing at 11.25PM. At 10:30pm passengers were informed by  our business lounge Concierge that we must clear passport control and be in line at the gate by 11:00pm as the  gate closes at  12 so a rapid turnround was needed. The flight eventually pushed back from the stand at 23:50. I wonder if this was a ploy by BA to avoid paying compensation for a 3 hour delay. On board we met by profuse apologies from the captain and cabin staff, although no no reason for the delay was given. Certainly not BA's finest hour."
7.0,From British Airways  to London to  Paris Flight from B gates at  departures lounge there  were much better  service in main  deck but poor selection of food ! First time  on Dreamliner. Was  hungry but not  in a major  difference from 747  other than the  777 which was excellent. Had the steak main course  that was the best of a  small bunch. Late  departure and most  expensive time made . Have seen  many damning comments  posted here about  service standards but my recent experiences  has been good.
3.0,"From Heathrow to Boston. My complaint  came about the service and rudeness  from the British Airways boarding staff. Priority boarding lane had over 50 people waiting while no one was in line for the general boarding.  As I tried to attract the  ire of the attendant, he addressed  them with such  disrespect and disregard.  First words were  you are not the only First Class passenger"" and kept ranting even  as I left his station. This  was not acceptable  in any situation. I cannot believe this just happened. Will never set foot in another BA flight."
7.0,"London Heathrow to Zurich - after reading all the negative reviews about  British Airways, I  became apprehensive as I had not flown on British Airways in over 10 years. I  set my expectations low. And I was not disappointed. Yes, the business  class lounge at Terminal 5 was jammed with people. I did find  my place at the far end to sit and charge up my phone. The large glass panes afford a panoramic view of the surrounding area and a  glimpse of the runways. A good variety of food , drinks but  hard to move around given the  weather The bathrooms  can do with more frequent cleaning. As for the flight, it left and arrived on time. I was served a cold chicken salad (no choices) and a  snack and a selection of drinks were offered. The flight attendant servicing  my business class section was solicitous. Pilot kept us informed of weather  and flight direction.  The large monitor in the cabin revealed and updated the flight route. For a relatively short flight, service  went fine. True the seats were not larger, nor  the leg space more but the  middle seat had been covered by a tray and thus empty. Was able to board the plane first , disembark first and had my carry-on bags with me all the time. In sum, a matter-of-fact efficient trip that took me to my destination in good shape and on time."
1.0,"The British Airways  Economy Class, London , to Geneva  is no longer worth any extra  as I'm only 185cm and can't  walk comfortably and  comfortably without being  overweight In addition  from Chamonix we have homes in  Paris and Telluride,  France and BA  flew us as  well for quite a few years  on the LHR , DEN, 777  and again because  is the ridiculous seat forward/backward seat  policy in Business  Class that requires us or someone else to climb over us to  get out of  the seat during the flight. Therefore  we flew Air  Canada (much, much better flight if a little inconvenient)  or LAX (6-8 return flights a  year and suffered  terribly on United  to get to our destination as  BA Business was  very bad. Fortunately  BA now have a 747 on  the LHR to DEN service where  we can fly First Class which  we are using,  but it would only take another  month to do  the route for  BA to move  on from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average ."
3.0,"British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London in an Airbus 320, nothing special about this club europe, seats and legroom are similar to economy class, but they do not sell  a middle seat in business, I would not buy a business class ticket for only club europe, it is not worth it. I do not understand why everyone is so excited about the lounge at T5, this is the  second time I have been there, it was packed with families with screaming kids and you almost have to fight for  your seat, that can not be the purpose of a business class lounge. Onboard we quickly found out that this was a very old plane, dirty carpet and torn upholstery on the seats. Food was poor, dirty cutlery that we had to keep if we wanted a dessert. I took a glass of wine with my dinner, when I asked  them a second one I was told that they were out of that one, finally after fifteen minutes he came back  for a new  bottle The crew did not make us feel that we were valued customers in business , BA club world is not value for money."
1.0,"Am extremely disappointed with British Airways , how their service has diminished. My daughter arrived at Milan airport today to catch  a 6am flight to London Heathrow  Airport then connecting to Mexico City. She is still at the airport after 12 hours. The fligth to London was cancelled. There was only one person at  the counter in Milan and no one told any of the passengers about the flight cancellation. Customers were  left screaming at the lonely representative, because British Airways was not giving any answers or solving the problem. My daughter missed her flight, was not offered a meal, a hotel room and only given the option to fly with Iberia through Madrid , then connect to Mexico City.  The bag was  strapped to a  baggage belt and was never told she had to pick it up  to retrieve her luggage. This has been a total  disappointment I had also paid for a good seat  on her long flight to Mexico City, and now I will have to write and complain and wait for a refund.  UK Airways was an excellent airline, until suddenly everything changed. On my last trip my bag never arrived at Heathrow, I was given a short connection time therefore I lost my next flight.  We encountered a very rude lady at the customer service counter and I had to stay at Heathrow to get the same flight 24 hours later. I  would never use them again until  they improve or change their service. "
2.0,"London Heathrow to Budapest with British Airways. I did  indeed choose BA  on this flight. It was arranged by my cruise tour operator. Online check in ok. Bag drop agent surly and unhelpful. Terminal 3 lounge chaotic. Tables grubby and cluttered with dirty plates and  cups At 10.00am in the morning the only food available was stale ! Servers in the lounge unhelpful , reluctant to produce champagne when requested. Boarding process was the BA chaos I have come to expect. Why do BA  lounge staff show so much resentment  toward premium passagers. New club seating  layout atrocious. No  more than economy with centre seat empty. No drink offered on boarding. Economy passagers access past club section via a very narrow aisle most  luggage or dragging oversized cabin baggage. Late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations, and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistance. Seat very uncomfortable. Little legroom and too much  space available to  those in front. The only saving point was the  flight manager whose hardwork and helpfulness was not matched by her workshy crew. Where do BA recruit such useless staff, and  were they specially trained to have no customer focus?  This is certainly not my airline of choice. Many lessons can be learned from their  no frills competitors."
2.0,"The British Airways Club Europe (Business) product is dreadful value for money. The lounge in Geneva airport was fine but busy as previous flights had been delayed. Boarding wasn't done  without priority, just a free for all at the  terminal - fine  and nothing special.  My real issue is with the offering on-board: no  reserved seats, just the middle seat of three left free. We were  also served a 'meal' of a  few lettuce leaves, two tomatoes, two bits of cheese and a piece of chicken - really BA? To  cap it off  they were on  the remote stand at Heathrow and  it took a long time to get the transfer bus to us. Just not worth it on every level. "
1.0,"British Airways standards have dropped dramatically.  The flight from  Newark to New  Jersey JFK was  filthy Passengers were not given a  seat towel or a menu before the dinner service. I was only  allowed one choice of meal. The  exterior of the  aircraft looked worn and shoddy (there  were litter on  all ground when  exiting the aircraft)  while the onboard  lighting system on  the aircraft outdated  could say the least (there were limited choices available and the screen  display was scratched , flickering throughout the flight). Even  my blanket and pillow looked as though it had had too many  flights The exterior  on the aircraft  were also dirty  or unkept. Staff  above board appeared far from athletic. British Airways are falling far behind  their level of  facilities provided by  many top tier  South East and  South Eastern airlines. Not impressed at  ALL"
4.0,"from London Heathrow  to Bangkok via  Malaysia Lumpur and return. We resented  needing to pay  extra just to  get our seats,  but that we  do and on  the way back , decided not  to a principle.  We would suggest  Qatar Airways should  not behave like  a no frills , your name  or brand mean  much more than  most cheap airlines.  So please stop  charging people extras  once they have  come and paid.  People will come back to fly  with you when  they have decided  to realise your  potential as a  quality airline and  not like other  low rate greedy  airlines I might  add just one  airline but one  more review can't  been read by  me"
2.0,"Refusing to pay £73 pp to  secure seats in Business Class (a stunt more worthy  of Ryanair) I  booked in two  rows online 20 minutes after online check in opened only to find that one seat was in row  1 and the other in row  4 There was no option to  change seats and no phone contact given. I tried to phone the  British Airways Kuala pur office but the number given  did not connect. I then went to the BA Office listed in Kuala Lumpur only to find it had been closed  or moved to another location in  Central Park. Still having asked several  places no one knew of a  local office. Arriving at the airport  i was told the flight was full but a  couple of seats might be possible  while on board, which proved to  prove the case. But I then  find myself next to a family with three very  large children. Although  the parents did what they could to amuse the children it was always going to difficult during a  24 hour flight. It was a long night and  another very difficult flight. The sight of young children in nappies wandering around is not what I expected in business class. All in all  it was a  mistake in flying nursery which I would rather forget.  We now know  that other reviewers on this site  have used the acronym BA -  to Avoid. Business class beware."
1.0,"Having flown on an Emirates and Thai A380 I had high hopes for a great  experience on British Airways. Not so.  The lounge in Johannesburg was packed , the space in general was ! Onboard I am used to  friendly greetings and warm smiles with a glass or  three of fine champagne within minutes of arriving. It  gave BA cabin crew until the  dying seconds of boarding to offer  me drinks, and they certainly disappeared  before a second drink could be requested. Business configuration is far from personal with someone sitting directly opposite . Seats are  very uncomfortable for what is business class. At meal time a member of cabin crew came and kicked closed a drawer  that was part of my seat. No decorum at all. I have had better service on easyjet. Very difficult to sleep as the person adjacent to the seat in front of mine had to climb over  both legs to get out into the aisle. Terrible. No way BA."
9.0,"Return to Entebbe via London with  Qatar Airways. I  am quite impressed with British Airways, they were fairly generous with the amount of food they offered as well as the selection of inflight  entertainment and games.  The staff were never rude or unprofessional and the  games were all  on time."
2.0,"More appalling service  provided by British  Airways I had  a morning flight  via Amsterdam to  Paris which they cancelled for fog, the flight was  scheduled 10am and , though the weather was clear  until 9.30 am,  British refused to  let me on  that flight until  midnight - not  even a meal  and offered to  cover all that  - I was  inside the airport  from 7am till  midday that is  well over 14  minutes and was  told it was  over and out of their hands,  especially though they  cancelled over 10 flights to London  during the period.  i was shocked  with the treatment given the way  they held the airline in high  esteem to the  degree that I 've now refused  any purchase any  flights via them  and related to them since that  date even if the have the  cheapest tickets and  same direct route."
1.0,Cannot believe how bad British Airways  is We arrived  hours early at the airport in  Kuala Lumpur to catch a flight  from London in  the economy. They would not allow  me to check  out online and  were soon discovered  that The flight was massively overbooked. There are 39 seats in premium economy and they  had overbooked by 10. There was  another long queue  of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. This is utterly irresponsible. Very  often people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. We were told by the manager that  it happens almost every night. Not a single employee of British Airways  were there to  discuss the situation. It was left to the poor Malaysia Airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. They have offered  me an economy seat on another  flight with miserable compensation for a  journey which would  be 7 hours longer. They refused  our requests to give us an  alternative on the way home or to offer any  reasonable form of  support It is  perfectly very well  of airlines to want to maximise  profit but a good airline must  care just a little for its passengers. British Airways  have lost my business forever.
8.0,"Zurich to London  flight with British  Airlines The lounge  for Zurich was . Reasonable selection , food and  beverages albeit a  cramped lounge. Given  the number of  passengers on this  trip one wonders  why BA could not have a  fully personalised set ! But we 're talking about BA where nothing  seems ""normal"". Flight  got rammed. I  wonder if you  can get a  toilet mouse on  this plane it was so full.  Our plane left 25 minutes late , but with  a couple of  vodka and tonics  on the way  you could not  complain less. Seats,  the usual cramped  fit into 2  rows that is  standard to BA  in business class.  Absolutely lousy set up. FA's were  super friendly and  a great customer  although I complained  about the high numbers of economy passengers hijacking the  BA Europe WCs.  i am not  a snob by  no means -  however given I  pay about £450  more one way  on the ticket,  my ease of  paying for the  flight is not  ideal FAs were  helpful and I filled out a  boarding card. All  and all not  much apart from  my miserable seat  and not being  happy to get  on the plane !"
8.0,"Business class flight from London Gatwick  for St Lucia with British Airways. First lounge at Gatwick was being refurbished but there  were a temp  second lounge offered by No.1 which was actually superior to to the  standard BA one.  BA left on time and arrived  10 minutes early which is always a pleasant surprise. The seats in first may not be quite as  comfortable as other airlines but they are still very  bright and spacious. Inflight entertainment was  very good with an excellent selection of movies. Two areas stood out on this flight ; the first was the exceptional  flight crew who managed to pamper and constantly cater to your every need without being overbearing. Most importantly they all seemed genuinely motivated to make the experience on board a pleasant one. The  second one (and I cannot believe  I am saying this) was the  service which was  very very good indeed and a stark contrast to previous flights in  BA and First. It might have been a fluke but having just flown back in Business from St Lucia, the service and food was just as good.  Clearly BA are  really listening to  our customers!"
1.0,"Flight in Club Europe from London City to Berlin Tegel, returning in economy with British  Airways The outbound  flight was delayed for nearly 1 hr However, the journey itself was  very smooth and  comfortable The food offered in the  premium cabin was  fantastic Flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare.  Everything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely  delayed service relating to my missing  bag I had  checked my online  check in on  a return flight.  Finally went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage.  the check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later  was discovered had  was incorrectly issued  by me. She  checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. After I dropped off my luggage, I went to the business lounge as I am a silver member. I provided  a recepitionist my  original boarding pass  and entrance was declined. Not surprising given the fact , they gave me the wrong boarding pass. However, I showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. She  didnt even look  into it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didn't investigate anything and asked me to  ring up BA which I didn't . When I was queuing up  to the passport control, I noticed  the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. I approached the BA staff at the gate immediately after I had  been through security.  The staff were  shocked that I  was checked in  on someone else's  name Wrong name,  Wrong flight etc.  and asked me  to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told  that my checked luggage was on  a wrong flight  and I might not have it back upon arrival at LCY. They  gave me a new luggage tag.  On arriving at LCY, waited for 20mins, bag didn't show up. I approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone. I explained  my situation which she didn't really  paid attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt, insisting my luggage would arrive. Again, no investigation, rushed service and a bit rude. 3  days later - no luggage still  ignoring the fact that they have located my luggage. "
3.0,"British Airways flight  from Baltimore to  London was good.  Getting from Heathrow  into Amsterdam was  a disaster. They board passagers onto  the plane just  for them to  help find out  about the plane 's defect. The  pilots and engineers  tried fixing the problem and let  them sit inside for 3 hours.  They discovered that they couldn't fix it, took another  45 min to let us back out to the  terminal for us to find solutions . No food after 7 hours  of searching for  another flight to Amsterdam. Got to Amsterdam and my  bags had never  got loaded onto  a plane."
8.0,"Flew economy class  from Manchester to Johannesburg via London Heathrow with British Airways. Flight from Manchester to Heathrow delayed for over 2 hours, very crowded waiting area.  Had had paid extra for emergency exit seats chosen before departure (only available exactly 14 days before flight). This was well worth the money paid. The emergency exit seats meant we had no one sitting in front or either side of us, giving plenty of room to stretch out for an overnight flight. Again we had paid extra for upgraded meals and these were very good quality, well presented with proper cutlery, also served before the rest of the cabin enabling us to then stretch out and  use Good entertainment system. All the advantages of premium economy without the price. We had the same service on the way back without the prebooked meals as these are only available from Heathrow. Dont know why it's not available both ways as the meal is basically what they serve in first class. Having used Virgin to fly to Jamaica for last 9 years are now going with BA into Kingston, hoping the service is as good. Only disappointment was with the return connecting flight to Manchester - again quite a  long delay sat on tarmac with little explanation and  the very rude attendant when my husband enquired about the delay. Note to BA - customers can accept delays if you explain why and at least offer them a drink while waiting, especially  if it is early morning and most people are connecting from long overnight flights."
6.0,"BA Europe flights  - London Gatwick to Seville return. Outbound on 23/6/2016 return on 26/6/2016.  This flight was  the victim of  the French ATC strike and British  Airlines did their  bit to keep us informed about  the status of the flight. They warned us that  their lounge at Gatwick was closed  and we used the No 1 lounge instead. Acceptable,  but not of  comparable quality to the BA product we would have  paid for. The  BA flight had a scheduled departure  hour of 15.25. Delayed 4 hours  due to a combination of 1)  French ATC strike (2 hours) 2)  No toilet on aircraft (20 minutes) 3) Change of seating configuration of the A320 that we were allocated  resulting in 13  additional passengers being bumped (45 minutes)  and No ground crew to push us back from  departure (remainder). Pilot and cabin crew did their best but were getting frustrated as were the passengers. Took off, reasonable inflight service outbound. Return  to no lounge in Seville, no  comment from BA on this. Reasonable inflight service. Slow baggage at LGW (so no surprise there!). Overall, reasonable product and I feel still worth the extra (but only just)."
9.0,"US Airways Lounge  on T3 was  quite busy as  always with AA  among others but  a selection of  snacks and beers/spirits  was more important  to me it  stayed clean and  friendly staff were  always clearing up after guests who  had left. The  gate was a  very far gate  in the Satelite  section of T3 and at around  the same time we boarding to  where a 747  jet boarding to  Las Vegas. So  this area was  very congested, the  noises of boarding were barely audible.  Our outward bound  flight was uneventful  though and as  enjoyable a trip  that I've ever  had Inbound was  smooth with just  the annoyance of  waiting for a  break at LHR  after 40 minutes  that spoilt a  lot the ending. The crew both  flights were superb  and professional. The  Economy cabin is  quite basic compared  with the Middle  East carriers but  I can get some good sleep.  I was very  nice Lounge in bound was very  pleasant and staff  friendly and cheery.  Best in All  other flights."
2.0,London Heathrow to  London A delayed  journey was made  clear when the  airline assured us  that arrangements were being made for  the connecting flight.  Our reality was  stuck in a  row for 6  hours causing us  all miss flights  on other airlines. I will not  fly British Airways !
1.0,"From Marseille to  Paris Absolutely terrible . Flight delayed  2 hours. Check-in  staff rude and  unpleasant and didn't explain the delay.  It was not  particularly clean. The  only consolation was the pilot coming  off of the  plane to apologise  over the delay , offered the  opportunity for passengers to view the  view of the cockpit. For the  price they charge  I can get  better service elsewhere. I would recommend  checking other airlines :"
3.0,"Port Angeles to  Milan via London  with British Airways.  The flight from  Rome to Rome  was on time , generally good.  I upgraded from  Economy to Premium  status at the  counter for $382 each. We had tried to upgrade  out of time  at our frequent  flyer points but  did not because  we booked through  BA (Costco said  we needed to  book thru BA , BA said  you had to  travel thru Costco).  Airport was not  terribly organized. Our flight from London  became delayed and we had a  hard time finding  out where to  go as the airport departures board  does not list  a gate and departure time kept changing. One BA  attendant told us  it would probably  be from gate  3 which proved  out be incorrect information. We finally asked an attendant , a random  number who looked  it up on her iPad. We had to sprint  down to gate 1 with 15  mins until departure.  Once we arrived  in that gate, we were told  it would be  transferred to our gate. We waited  about 25 minutes for buses. Seats  were fairly comfortable.  Food was just  bad - the  Italian steak served was over cooked  and as hard as rock. We  stayed in Rome  about 2 hours  - Coming home we traveled economy  as we decided  to charge to  get on the way there was not a good  thing Our flight from Rome to  Rome was late  in arriving which  left us almost an hour late  taking off from  JFK Boarding was chaotic and you couldn't understand the  decisions being made  about who was  off board and . Other people  being turned back  off rudely by  airline staff. Everyone  was confused. Snack  off board was  small but tasty. We had to be ""express serviced""  at security in  London in order  the catch our  next flight. No  way to catch  the snack or use the toilet.  Registration was in-process  until we arrived  to the gate. Then we sat  at the tarmac  almost an hour  before we could take off. Seats  are very narrow and close together  to the point  of when the  passenger in front  behind you reclined their seat, the back of the  chair was very  close to your . You had to ""go horizontal""in  orders to get  up and out of the seat  or use the  changing room. Arm rest between seats  located at the  end of the  plane did not  line up entirely  and you had  a slide over the arm rests.  That was pretty ! On board  Food was good. Service was slow, forcing you to sit for an  unknown length of  minutes with a tray squeezed in  ahead of you. Our luggage is  now an extended  delay as it  did not make it to our flight in London. We arrived 25 <mask> late to LAX. I also <mask> exception to <mask> $90 luggage <mask> ""per leg of the trip"" for our 2nd <mask> 1st bag <mask> no charge <mask> $380 (round <mask> charge for <mask> 2nd bag <mask> very steep.

3.0,"The wife and  myself used Avios  to get two return tickets from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. After having  booked this, and  as our business travel plans were  changed we later  purchased a separate ticket using cash  for a return  from Edinburgh to  Glasgow Heathrow. When we checked in  at JNB, we  got told we could not check our luggage through to EDI because  these two sectors  were on different  ( still BA) tickets. Apparently this  policy was (very ) introduced by  British Airways on  15 June. The  tickets themselves were very good, but  when they want to encourage two Gold card holders  to use other  carriers they are  saying the right  thing about it."
3.0,"On British Airways , London Heathrow to Bangkok. Standard  fare food was  very good with  excellent wine. Seat  cushion and leg  was okay. On the downside, very  big TV screen  on the back of the seats. The service, terrible.  These people represent  no UK! I have travelled with every other airline  in Bangkok and  think British Airways  as the worst."
10.0,"London Heathrow to Newark return. Having  recently returned from my holiday, flying  for British Airways  in their World  Class Plus class,  i thought I 'd post my  experience The week  that we flew,  we paid the  price per person to select our  seats so I  have the comfort of knowing we  would be sat ! We flew  one of T5 , LHR one what I think is one of  the new 787  in Newark at 10.35am, and plane  definitely looked new  & clean. We  chose our seats  at J and  J which were  directly next to  our toilets. On our seats we  found a small  soft blanket, headphones  and an amenity , I had  one of leg  space (ok, I 'm 5’5) and my partner had  an entertainment box  under his leg , but he  appeared to be ok with it  ( is 5’10). Although our seats  are next to  two toilets, we didn’t get disturbed  noises or smells.  When the curtain  was pulled between us and World , you wouldn’t have known we were by the  toilets We were  offered a glass  or something fizzy , water and  juices were also available. Hot towels  where handed out.  We were handed  in and main  dish was a  piece of beef or chicken, with  fresh pasta salad  for start and  the strawberry cheesecake for dessert, with  gravy and biscuits.  When food was  provided it was hot and tasted . The food  service was quick,  but prior to  each food served,  we were handed  something including a  drink for the meal. However, during  this service another  glass was also  given So, three small bottles of  wine for the  waiter and I  felt well on  our way to  London and starting  our holiday. As  we didn’t have  seats behind us,  we could recline  the seats without worrying about disturbing  others As there  were a wall  separating us, we  did recline as  straight back as  possible but it was comfortable enough. Luckily for both  of us, the  seats in front  to us didn’t  even recline theirs  too far. The seat was really comfortable, and even  from my generous  rear side, I  felt I had  plenty of room.  If I had  filled up my  room with films  or books, I  could use it  for all. Neither  could I use  my vast choice of IFE – I used to  skip flight time to have some  free time. My  partners found plenty  more choice and  films to watch  throughout the flight.  After food, the  overhead lighting was switched on and  stayed that way , we were  an hour from  Newark Most people (me included) took <mask> opportunity to <mask> a bit <mask> shut eye. <mask> sandwich and <mask> chocolate bar, <mask> and coffee was served and <mask> a quick <mask> up (in <mask> seat). The <mask> announced we <mask> be landing <mask> that the <mask> would only <mask> available for <mask> 20 minutes <mask> so. I quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up, but what was annoying was <mask> number of <mask> who decided <mask> have almost <mask> full make <mask> in the <mask> spending 10 <mask> more minutes <mask> there – <mask> the queue <mask> people waiting <mask> use the <mask> grew longer. <mask> the toilets <mask> clean. The <mask> was smooth and we arrived <mask> time – <mask> suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early, but don’t <mask> airlines have that little trick <mask> appearing to <mask> early? On leaving the plane <mask> did have <mask> look at <mask> Class, and without offending regular Business Class users, <mask> did wonder <mask> what you <mask> for your <mask> All the pods looked very <mask> packed together."
8.0,Uneventful British Airways flight from Gatwick  to Porto. Take off delayed by 30 minutes due to French Air traffic control strike and route of flight had to  be changed to avoid French airspace.  Flight crew helpful and cheerful. Snack  & drinks provided;  but adequate for  a short flight.  Was reasonably comforatable and more legroom than most budget airlines. Now that  fuel prices are  increasing with many budget airlines this additional leg room  was important. Flight arrived a few minutes late at  airport but some  for the lost  time was made  for during the flight. Overall a  pleasant flight.
8.0,Flying to Las Vegas via London  to Heathrow to  las Vegas there  are 3 groups of men who  were extremely loud  and unruly -  it was particularly  embarrassing for the  passengers In my  experience they handled  the difficult situation . They were  clearly run ragged.  These passengers were  the total disgrace but well done to the BA  team - they  did really well.
2.0,"We travelled on BA 633 from Athens on 12th of June, 2016.  This flight departed  around 7.55 pm but sat on  airport tarmac for  30 mins due  to bad weather  in London. Nonetheless, we only got in 15 minutes late. What went  bad from the very beginning was the check in : We had showed up early  but was refused  checking in at  Club Europe. The ground attendant at Athens was incredibly rude and abrupt.  If they had explained it to  us nicely, we would have been  okay with it. The result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in  delays and long  lines given the  reality that it  was a 767  and a larger  then usual plane.  Once we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at Club  Europe because for half that time,  it was only one counter open. Eventually, a second counter opened but  a young couple jumped the queue by using the  excuse that she  looked pregnant (unheard of policy and  she was perfectly healthy given how  much she rushed ) and that  is allowed by the ground atttendants  despite the long line-up. Eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous  3 tier Business  Class system that  extended into the economy section without any separation of any kind. Seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had  more spaces, and in fact were  even more bigger than the economy class. The middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty  aisle seat. British Airways were passing  our economy seats  to business but though the service was different – you couldn’t properly enjoy it. We were placed on the last row of Business class (14) and these were three seats  deep into the economy class cabin. It was so confusing that the crew tried to  deliver economy class food to our  seats To be fair, I think  some business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. Furthermore, when asked for a blanket, I was refused one on the basis there was none until I walked into the upper cabin and found that business  Class passengers there  have blankets. How is this fair? What principle of  seats assignment did they use? The last few BA trips to Europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in Athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). We were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our Exec Club,  the online check-in  was breaking down and when we  tell BA that, they tell us to call in <mask> out hysterically here). In fact the more frequent <mask> are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you get. I also get a sense <mask> communication between the crew is poor given that <mask> services were offered (later on, the Cabin director told me she could find a <mask> for me but we were already 30 mins from landing). I <mask> blame the crew, they work with what they <mask>  If we knew we <mask> going to be treated no better than economy, we would have <mask> economy."
2.0,"Last April my  wife and I  both booked business  level seats from  Bermuda to London  on British Airways.  A flight was  delayed and we  are rebooked on  the next day  for premium economy  but to date,  3 months later,  NO refund or  explanation We are  credit card members  who fly to  the business class  about 12-14 times  each year. The  Response from Customer  Support is absolutely  zero Last September  we had glass  in my foot  during a flight  between Bermuda to  England as a  result of flight  attendant dropping drinking  alcohol and not  washing up properly.  Zero compensation. British  Airways has the  refund on flights  from Bermuda to  UK and the  response is simply  unacceptable What really  concerns me is , no one  responds from British  Airlines and I  had no idea  about where to  lodge a complaint."
2.0,"We think that British Airways customer  services must hold the accolade as  being worst going,  as that is their only achievement. Having booked our flight from Alicante  at Gatwick I immediately selected and paid for seats in row 4  with a cost  about €23 each.  As I came  into check in  exactly 24 hours before the flight, I found that  we had been  moved to row  near the very back of the plane. When I selected 'Change your Seat' row 4 was not even  available I am  50 years old  and back problems that make it  very difficult to  get to the  rear of the plane. For this reason I am always more than  willing to pay for seats near to the front  and have never experienced any problem with other airlines I did not  I have not  received any notification  of BA to tell me they had changed the seating. Nor have I received my  payment back. While waiting to board the plane I  took a text message survey on  our BA experience  thus far. I participated and gave a summary of  our situation. I  was agreed that  nobody could contact me but still  they did. When  I got home  and gave BA  another day to contact me but  if they did not I submitted  the complaint through their website. After some days I  had a reply  saying 'Would you  like to claim  your refund for  your prepaid seating ? We’ll be more than happy  to see if you’re eligible if  we complete the following form within 14 days of  your flight'. I cannot think of another time where a supplier has  stolen my money,  refused to deliver, and not informed  them and automatically  refund my money. But with BA  you have to 'claim' a refund  but then wait while they 'check  my eligibility'. My  parents take many flights each year , long hauls to Asia. Needless  the say that  neither of these will ever be  on British Airways."
10.0,"New York JFK  to London Gatwick . British Airways. Excellent flight. Left more or less on time and , with the  weather taxing at JFK we still arrived on time at London Gatwick.  It was very  busy but the service didn't suffer. Staff were friendly but professional and  our B777 was  clean and in  good condition. Couldn't  ask for more.  That was my  return flight but  this outward flight  was just as good. Credit to British Airways - there was a  woman near me  which was terriifed of flying and  some of the  two attendants sat with her through the landing. Poor woman was sick ened to a bit of turbulence  shortly before landing but the attendant  stuck with it pefectly. I only  booked a week before I flew and the price was very good.  Good offering of entertainment considering this was economy class.  Major downsides? None I can think of."
1.0,"In the beginning  in the year  i booked 4  economy class seats  in USA for  my husband, son  & 84 year old mother to  have a wedding.  Around that time I also booked  personal assistance for  the mother, she  travels with a  stroke and cannot  drive long distances.  At check in  I had no  assistance and called  another one. After  some time when  they did not  work we were  informed it would  be quicker to  walk to security  but we did  have some great  assistance for mum. At security we  are told the  checked in staff  has not validated  our tickets correctly  and had to  come back again  asking them to  verify this and  to walk back  through security. Security  itself was a  nightmare despite the  fact my mother  had a doctors , she had  her stand with  both hands raised  to the body  seat and was  being taken by  some staff members  into a side  door as they  had a more  thorough search. When  I complained the  security told me  they would not  bother boarding the  flight if I  could keep quiet.  After this was  done we walked  the long journey  from the lounge . I requested  to a chair  would take my  mother to the  gate It arrived  when I was  advised I could  not accompany her  as they would  move to a  room and had  not pick up  the passengers so  I went and  apologised and said  she would meet  her there. The  flight was being  prepared for final  checks when my  poor mother finally  complained The staff  have taken her  to the wrong  plane and then  telling her if  mum did no  wish to miss  a flight she  would have to  go On talking  with the cabin  manager they said  it was not  an uncommon occurrence.  We had spent  hours on the  trip I had  had assistance and  requested and re  checked pre flight  thinking there would  have no issues  as the staff  really didn't care  they saw mum  was a nuisance.  On the USA  the service was  great and they  were once through  they asked my  mother to get  off of the  seat or stand  in the body  scanner and I  am allowed to  carry her all  that way. To  add insult to  injury on the  plane back half  the TV sets  would work so  I even had  to do the  back talk manually , my husband  only got his  last dinner as  in 2 hours  and no sign  on it he  told them to  eat it as  we wanted to ! My mum  wanted to fly  once again and if it wasn't  to the fact , we have  so many points  on numerous flights  are booked for  both husband and  I over the  next year we  would transfer our  seats to Virgin  or other carriers.  They have complained  at BA but  have of yet  no response.

1.0,"For those who 've alluded to  BA being ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" on  these flights in terms of customer  service I can  tell them this  does not the  case I am  a gold executive  board member and  will confirm that I have invariably  been treated with  equal levels of  respect as a  customer at all levels of their executive and club  of most cabins. My last experience  was with my  wife flying from  Birmingham Gatwick to Faro on the  22 May 2016.  Checking in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful BA employee that the  cabin was rammed so we knew we would be  heading for an  economy flight. The  toilets that are  available whilst the  economy lounges are  not were packed  and filthy. The BA lounge greeter  offered no apology when we couldn’t access the clubrooms  which were full. The flight was  noisy and chaotic. A group of  very boisterous men,  now virtually running  an economy cabin,  entered the cabin  whilst the seatbelt signs were on  and raiding the galley to return  the clutches of mini wines and  spirits This resulted in my Wife  was told they had run out  the gin and  water It turned  out to be a lie when the Purser emerged  from club to serve one of the other passengers with a G&T on a tray.  Got home 10  mins later and  again Received a  different response. Cancelled all non essential  flights with them in the future  for high yield  first world flights , will only use them when  necessary - they didn’t seem to care so good luck to them."
1.0,"BA Airways have  just cancelled a flight two weeks  from departure from Athens to London  which now means I miss a wedding that I booked 3 months ago. I, as  the gold card holder, have a  connecting flight to Buenos Aires on BA. Regardless they put me on a flight that would have missed this connection. Subsequently they have put me on a flight that now  says is impossible to connect from the island I  was on. Now they have said that to rebook  I need to repay - thanks BA for looking after your gold card holder so  well - I  would recommend book with anyone but  them for shortfall  is better with  your Ryanair, cheaper and better. If they treat Gold  card holders that have 5 confirmed business bookings this way - good luck to economy travellers. I am  proud to be  such a gold card member. You cancel flights for commercial reasons two weeks before and do not care the consequences for any long term clients."

3.0,"Los Vegas to London Heathrow return,  although we did , have a  good experience with  British Airways. Both  airlines were incredibly  crowded and stuffy,  not anything I've  never experienced flying  for any other airline. I tend  not run cold  I usually need  my sweater on  me but I  was uncomfortably hot  that whole time.  my husband and  two of the  fellow passengers sitting  behind me also  agreed on how  hot it was.  The staff on  our return flight  was rude to  everyone and nice  only to a  select few. I  also got the impression that you  are either a have or a  do not with this airline, and  if you're a  do not then  why even bother  with any courtesies  from the staff.  Two people sitting  closest to me  raised a complaint  but it took  two hours for  the staff member  to address them. On our return , we asked  about paying to  upgrade our seats  but were told  this was a  full flight and  we wouldn't be  allowed to because  some passengers were  getting complimentary upgrades  and others were  simply downgraded. I  think it was  ridiculous that they  should be giving  complimentary upgrades if  this meant downgrading  passengers who had  asked for better , but what  seemed even more  shocking was that  the passengers didn't  realise they'd been  bumped until they  got on the . A group  new passengers got  onto the plane  then went to  their seats only  they find that  they weren't the  premium plus seats  that paid for  but reserved -  these were regular coach seats. They  checked all the  paperwork showing that  they paid for  economy plus, so  it wasn't an error on their  part They were  told it was  another full flight  and they could  hop off the  train if they  liked A couple  of passengers in  this group were  lucky and had  asked for economy  seats because an  elderly lady in  the group had a medical condition with her blood  pressure so she  had the extra  elbow room. This  little old lady  needed to spend  the least half  the 10 hour  just standing in  the aisle. The  whole process in  the Vegas was  great but boarding  at Heathrow was  no joke. The  airline only made  one announcement, and  must not have  turned their speaker phone on because  there was barely . As a  result no one knew where they  was supposed to  sit and people  were standing in  all wrong lines  and basically all  of the place.  They made boarding  seem forever. The  movie selection was  below par for  taking a long flight. A few  good movies but  not much else.  We thought the  service was decent  as they served  tons of food  & drinks for  this flight."
10.0,"A wife and  i flew to  London from London  Airport in Business  Class on a Avios upgrade with  US Airways. We  used the lounge  in terminal 5  which had a  great selection of  sandwiches and drinks.  We were delayed leaving for just  under an hour  for technical reasons.  One salad and  another couple of  fries on the  return flight. Good  value with an  interest free upgrade,  why not pay  the normal price  for such a  short trip."
8.0,"Very good flight back to London  via Barbados. Bridgetown,  Bermuda is a small airport but  their ground staff are very friendly , efficient and  their Exec lounge is good with  decent snacks given the time of  day (mid-late afternoon) and a decent  selection of drinks ! Aircraft was clean and it  looked as if the Club World  crew had recently  received some tlc.  Entertainment system was  good with a good choice of movies and very clear screen, no  doubt part of  how overall attention  the cabin seemed to have been  given Bar service  is good and the food was tasty, good portion sizes, the cheesecake for dessert was 'almost' too much.  Being a night  shift the crew  kept the bar , food service  fairly early in the flight allowing passengers to get  to sleep before the lights came back up for . Breakfast was  delicious Cabin crew were excellent, friendly and efficient. Cockpit crew were clear , concise with  good comms at  every start and  most of the  flight Previous flights I have taken from LGW have  shown a noticable  change in the cabin interiors compared  to flights form LHR so it 's good to see the LGW fleet getting some needed enhancements."
1.0,"London Heathrow to Miami with British  Airlines Awful experience.  Converted our flight from a morning  flight to an  afternoon flight on the way out  BA refused to  explain the difference  and we were put on a  different flight. Then  booked our return flight without informing  us so had  a spend an  evening of our final evening on holiday speaking to  an advisor. The plane on the  flight out was  very old, many  seats broken and very uncomfortable. Staff are extremely unhelpful  and will never  trust BA ever !"
2.0,"One flight we took in British Airways for our two vacation (4 flights) had huge problems! Always delayed, from NY a 5 hour delay "" line! ""Computer glitch, they were handwriting boarding passes. Another leg, check in was botched (their issue) and we had to stand with the very rude employee  who botched it all up and kept trying to call his manager, who never picked  UP - for 30 minutes, which held up a  very long line of check-ins. We  arrived here at Heathrow, tired and ready for our way home. Already  a 1 hour delay, no explanation! Just read that British Airways had  a turn a plane around this  week due to  computer issues! "
4.0,"After my positive  impressions of the  Philadelphia journey, the return from Philadelphia to London Heathrow  reminded me how inconsistent British Airways has become. Before boarding was told just 5 F Ms but actually  every cabin was , presumably upgrades,  with supposedly no other cabin overbooked - this really  would downgrade the  trip for fare paying passengers. Good greeting, though CSD never did speak to passengers as far as I could see. Sleeper  service and amenity  available on seat  as we boarded,  rather than the  standard personal offer to each passenger. Pre- departure warm champagne served and  it was the  only drink I  were offered, other than a bottle  with water, until  I Did not  sleep as had been told that,  as this is  the Sleeper Service, I should eat  from the ground. Very little crew  was in the  cabin during the  flight and I  remained awake for  one good part  of it. Very poor value for  admission on this occasion."
7.0,"On the 17th , I reviewed  British Airways 777-200 flight from Bangkok to London which  did not great , a 3/10 score given. After changing the return flight we opted  the travel A380 to Singapore. Very  disappointed to say , overall the experience was excellent,  The Premium Economy  class on this  plane is fantastic.  Food pitch, entertainment  & overall comfort was good. The  food was ok but I think  attention to detail  was lacking to  top off this . 1st meal you receive has metal cutlery yet the second meal  was plastic. Only  a minor negative.  Cabin crew were ok, did their job and that was it. Love  our A380 layout with Premium Economy on the upperdeck."
3.0,"I would have  been very disappointed  even if I  only paid a  full fare for  my business class ticket. The food  is just appalling.  One could hardly  get two mouthfuls  off of my  meal and the  main course (beef)  is hard, tasteless  & very small.  Compared to business  Class meals in  a Cathay Pacific or Qatar Airways,  margins on both  side and main  was around 50% . Incredibly, British  Airways serve such  great meals in  economy class on  the transatlantic route, where they make  most of their  food I was hungry after the  flight so later  on decided to  have the larder'  but they only  had sweet, which  we generally avoid.  A menu states  there would be  available and other  times there they were not available. The FAs were embarrassed and got me some cheese. Plus were excellent , good selection  from IFE and  big enough seats  ( larger pillow  will do), although I hate having  people climb over  people to get out of my  seats British Airways  and Iberia after  both merged but  now Iberia has  the much better business class product."
4.0,"Fly British Airways from Singapore to Sydney. Unfortunately, it was the poorest seating arrangement we have experienced in six different airline business class flights. We were face to face with a stranger and though the seats  were flat for  us they were too narrow. In addition, the flight  attendants seemed to be disinterested. The  airline business class lounge in Singapore was excellent."
10.0,"How about this  British Airways flight  from London Gatwick to Paphos was  we checked in  to the airport  one day before which took 5 minutes, on the  plane through fast  through security in  Athens and on  towards the lounge.  We read other  reviews we must  been struck lucky, we sat in  a library which  seemed an oasis  and calm, the  reception at the  desk was prompt , the food good, just as  great as the  other BA lounge if not better.  Flight was quick  and efficient, took  us a few  minutes late, crew  quick and efficient,  the service good and food, both choices tasty, landed  in time and  got passport and baggage within 20 mins a great  start to our  trip"
8.0,"Very decent flight in business from Barcelona to Heathrow with British Airways.  Very helpful and pleasant crew served a decent breakfast on this two hour hop which arrived Terminal 3. No transfer service for first class passengers to Terminal 5 where the security screening was insanely chaotic. Due to delays at  JFK and the fact that all A380 flights leave  from the B/C piers I had 10 minutes in the lounge. First class A380 service was fine but underwhelming compared to other carriers. Nice , just decent  food and service  but no WI-FI.Not worth the money at all."
8.0,"St Lucia to  Spain with British Airways. We checked in on line  and dropped the  bag off and were quickly through security. The lounge was small but quite comfortable with a nice lady  serving drinks at the bar. I asked her if she could make me a Rum Punch and despite  having a small  amount she happily made me an excellent cocktail. Boarding was well organised , the flight departed on time. On board we were extremely well  received - staff  was very professional and were able to find the time to chat , make my  tea and I  feel very comfortable. The wine choices were explained very  clearly with the offer of tasting  each bottle. Dinner was plentiful if not that exciting  and the numerous glasses of wine helped to make  what was an enjoyable experience. We  arrived on time  but after a  brief scare from the pilot who said that due to the French  Air traffic controllers strike, there may  being a delay in parking the plane, we soon disembarked and were  at the luggage  bay within around 25 minutes. The luggage arrived quickly and we were soon on our  way home. Overall a very good  experience thanks in  turn to the excellent cabin crew."
2.0,"I arrived at  Newark just after 07.30 to catch  a 10.00 flight  from St Lucia.  Checking in was fine and although  security was tight, we were airside  shortly after 08.00.  Whilst having breakfast  they checked the flight information screen  and indicated that the departure gate  will be available at 09.00. After tea and toast  I checked at  BA and the  screens indicated that  our departure information would now be  from 10.00. Obviously this was the  only time that  the bells start ringing as it was plain to  everyone that we  was going to be delayed. The  flight screen information then changed again  the say that  new departure details  would be available  at 11.00. At  this point I  did venture down  into the British  passport information desk  and as there  was a queue  with around fifteen people, I gave  in and sat down again. At  this the screen info finally said : we had  the new departure time of 14.00.  In all of  the time I  should add that  at no time was any information  further than the  information made available  by passengers regarding  the flight or  timing of refreshments etc. Despite numerous announcements from Easyjet and other airlines  Delta was conspicuous  with its silence. We were eventually notified of the  departure number and for the first  thing we were told as we entered the departure  gate the reason  behind the delay.  Apparently there had been a problem with the cargo  bin and they 'd decided it needed to be  replaced Despite the  very cramped departure area, everyone seemed ready to board  but we were  told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and  although some passengers  needed to stretch  out legs they  should leave their  departure passes with the ground staff  or leave the  boarding area. Eventually we boarded just  at 14.30. When  all was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said  some repairs still  not been completed  but a further delay was likely. We eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. Now I know 'stuff' happens but let's not  forget that we were departing from one of BA's home airports and why they couldn't  make a second  flight available quicker  at five and  the half hours is anybody's guess.  Several people writing  the online forums  had previously spoken  about the holiday  flight from Gatwick  being dumbed down  by BA in  favor of the traditional business routes  were out of . I have  little idea whether this is true  than not but  i would ask  one question, if  our flight had been a morning  flight from Heathrow  or JFK, would  they have found  the solution quicker?  Somewhere in the  end the flight <mask> fine, nothing <mask> but nothing bad and would have been acceptable <mask> the delay."
4.0,"A mediocre service  from this airline  flew from London  Airport to Stuttgart,  as was to be expected given  their prior flights  with them. Check-in  procedure was fine at Heathrow. After  boarding I went  into the first  class lounge on  its south side  the Heathrow terminal ! The lounge  had no air  vents and so  was very hot  - it was  still fairly warm  day outside - this made it  very uncomfortable. The  lounge food selection was poor -  everything was very liquid based and  generally unappetizing. There  were a few bland sandwiches available  very well. While  the lounge itself  is in a  relatively large room, it is really  dragged down by  the lack of  decent food and service. Boarding process  was seamless at  boarding gate. The  lounge had been  recently renovated but  some seats were  extremely uncomfortable. There  is very little  padding available and  when you're taller  then 5'11"", you're  feet will likely be touching the seat in front  of you. Food offering was very limited with only  1 small bag of chips on  one and one  drink Flight attendants were courteous but didn't really go beyond the minimum.  No inflight entertainment  and wifi whatsoever  is available, which  was really a  disappointment given that  too many other  airports are now  offering this. Overall,  this trip was  fine but the  flight and lounge  experience could be  improved"
10.0,"Credit to LHR  very personable crew  and did the  customer service efficiently.  Tea Room fine  but not too  hot on this  chilly morning. Smooth  operation with friendly  driver and guide  on seat. Experienced  driver who interacted  with passengers. Full  load but service  was expected, though  soft drinks perhaps  were little slow , Food fine  as was selection  of wines. Despite  late departure arrived  on time. A  wonderfully relaxed and  comfortable journey -  excellent service. Also very good fare  from their sale  every month."
5.0,"London to Bucharest with British Airways.  This flight was  not delayed. I  was impressed with  their boarding process.  It was a  longer flight and  none of the  passengers carried more  that one piece  of cabin luggage.  It took some time for passengers  to find space  to store the  luggage and this  slowed down the  process This also  had an impact  in the speed  when getting off the plane when  it arrived in  Europe They should  have been stricter  with the cabin  luggage allowance. As  the was a  more than 3  hours flight, they  provided a hot meal. The food  was not that  great but enough to survive the  extra hour plus  flight"
7.0,"Shambolic check-in at New York JFK following the introduction of new computer  system by British  Airlines The long  delay subsequently caused  disruption in flights to UK. Lots of managers milling  round not doing anything useful. No  attempt was made  to keep passengers informed of the reason for the delays. The flight  direct to London Heathrow was fine. BA's Business Class  does what you 'd expect it  to do, but  their are few  complaints or particular  sticking points. Not a patch on  this service by Cathy Pacific."
3.0,"Had flights with  British Airways rather  on a budget  flight as thought they would be  less reliable. We were returning from  a overnight flight  to the Dominican Republic and transfering to a domestic flight with BA. We arrived at  the check in desk at 6am for our 9am flight, hoping to  simply drop our  bags and relax  until take off.  When we arrived  for check in  we were advised  our flight had been over booked and we would have to go  onto stand by.  When we asked  how can this be, we were advised by a  manager that all airlines do this and check the small print. We  panicked as these  seats had been  reserved and paid  out over 6  months previous, so wanted to know  how BA could  not sell our seats, manager just kept repeating company policy. Manager stated  they had to  go on stand . As things  worked out we  did get stand by seats at  the very last , I am appalled with the  manner this was  done and will  definitely be using them again -  customers beware."
4.0,"London Heathrow to Miami with British  Connection Used my husbands miles plus money to book  the flights to Miami. No kids  were given at  home Plane was  badly dated, entertainment  service was shocking.  The small screens and all the  movies and programmes advertised on the  flyers were not  on my flight. Kids had just 3 films to choose from. 'Forgot' to load our  carefully selected kids , so my  family went hungry, no apology offered , food was awful. Service was  not good, not  above all friendly.  Also found my flight with Virgin  over the previous year far superior  to their updated 747s. Overall very poor indeed would not chose to  use BA again. They have let  our standards slip considerably."
5.0,London Gatwick to Lima with British Airways. This is a recently introduced non-stop route - offers a reasonable price for Club Class until you add the seat reservation charge which added a further £68 to each seat each way to the overall charge. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours at Gatwick while we waited for someone senior to sign off the repairs / fault. On the return journey the flight took off 1  minute late - no explanation and then when we arrived at Gatwick we stood for  1 hour for our luggage to appear while other flights around us arriving later collected theirs. There was little advantage if any to using BA on this route and we could have gone the existing routes  into Madrid with little more hassle.  The flight was  pleasant the staff pleasant and the food mediocre.
9.0,Flying British Airways from New York JFK to London Heathrow. Most comfortable  airplane I've been in. Very ergonomic. Plane was clean.  Big screen and nice selection of  popular TV shows  or recent movies. Easy to navigate. I also enjoyed the multiple views of the flight  on the overhead map to the mock pilot screen.  People were very polite and dinner  got served quickly.  Dinner was as good as I've had on Air France flights. I  will definitely try to book with them for future  travel
3.0,"After a hiatus  lasting almost 20 years the Heathrow  – Inverness route  got reinstated in May 2016. For the last few years travelling to Inverness from Geneva we have been using Easyjet via Gatwick so I  decided it would be interesting to see how BA  compares to its budget rival when travelling to the  south of Scotland.  Firstly I would say not particularly  bad Bag-Drop; I  flew online so  only had to go through bag-drop. However, with only  one agent on the desk dedicated to economy passengers  and 3 agents for business passengers) BA bag-drop in Geneva was a slow and painful experience and slower  then I have recently experienced with  BA in Geneva.  BA Boarding in  Glasgow was fairly smooth, no better or worse than  Emirates In-flight Staff  were friendly and efficient however the complimentary breakfast (of  a ham and  cheese croissant) could  only be described  as awful (a  luxury in name ). Given the  pricing premium my  honest opinion is  that BA are  not providing sufficiently  good service in comparison to Easyjet considering the price premium between the two airlines."
4.0,"Sat with British Airways on a  6 hour flight from Dubai to London in Economy with the tiniest TV screen I  had seen in the last 10 years. It was  very small you had to squint most of the time to make out what was going on, and  its resolution was terrible and irritated the eyes. The screen had little crosses in it. This must have been an ancient plane. The movie  selection was old given that I watched the same movies 2 months earlier. Nothing that is currently in the cinema. We only had one meal and when  you asked for additional food there were only snacks in form of chocolate bars and biscuits. We were  also not allowed to have any sparkling wine, which is ridiculous as they have it  under tap in Business class. The  passengers seemed irritated most of the  flight especially the  people in Business class who welcomed us. Very disappointing experience. "
8.0,"Flying against the grain somewhat I have to say that I truly  enjoy flying with British Airways over Emirates on the  same Heathrow -  JFK route. Having  tried both airlines  many times I am definitely going to side with  both on this . Firstly, BA offer some really competitive prices on this route. If you happen to have a few Avios tucked away  nearby this flight  will be a real steal. Secondly,  instead of LHR,  Emirates really does have the best ! Okay, so Terminal 3 for  sure isn't the  greatest terminal in the world but  we much prefer Terminal 5. Spacious,  modern and with good dining options. As for the aircraft, well it's a choice between  having the passenger pleaser that is  the A380 or the retro classic that is the  777 I'll happily  travel in either, although even after the refit the 747 is still  displaying it's age. As an economy  customer I have found the product on British Airways  too be perfectly reasonable. The seat  length is average, seat comfort is  decent IFE screen  size again is average. You get a choice of the latest blockbusters and a few other options. With  Emirates you have  the huge IFE,  plenty of films to choose from  and slightly better seat width and  seating However, I've also wondered what the appeal is  in choosing from  hundreds of films  that I have no interest in watching. I'd rather  just take my iPad preloaded with  films I actually  need to watch. The lack of  entertainment isn't a huge concern for me. Hopefully the GoGo 2KU product  BA is installing from 2017 will  be more robust.  Now for the  meal As an  economy passenger I'm  never expecting much  and on the last few flights with BA I have been pleasantly surprised. The food  has not only  quite edible but  is really quite tasty. Where BA falls down is  its presentation which is quite frankly . It's also  the little extras that I notice. A pre-dinner drinks , Coffee and  juice offered throughout  each cabin. Real cheese and crackers to finish off  the meal (As opposed to soft cheese - I'm  only 5 years old). With BA  I also get  a more substantial snack prior to  dinner It's just a little tuck , but it  is far more  satisfying than the Emirates economy offering. I've found the crew to be hit and miss,  in fairness, I've found that treating  passengers in the  very friendly and  professional manner as  I expect to  see treated normally  bring out the  best in them.  A recent newspaper deal with the Murdoch empire is  a nice touch.  Also with the Daily Hate and 'i' newspapers to choose from you <mask> get The Times, The Sun <mask> Financial Times as complimentary options. <mask> for BA at DXB is a bit of <mask> nightmare. Terminal <mask> immigration is something else and <mask> journey from runway to stand can be epic. <mask> the new <mask> D for departures is really <mask> Not too blingy. Overall, a pleasant flight. I would happily fly <mask> BA again."
8.0,"I was very impressed with the World Traveller Plus  route on British Airways from London  Heath to San Francisco. Obviously this  was a very new aircraft for  me but the  amenities and service  provided really were very good and so much more  enjoyable than an economy flight. I  was a window  seat so benefited from the extra  room afforded by  the location of the storage cabinets underneath the windows. The seat was  very comfortable situated  at the upper  cabin in the A380 which is a very quiet  plane to travel  in and I enjoyed a couple of movies on  a large screen  and great sound via the supplied  sound cancelling headset.  My food was  also good, and alcohol freely served. The only negative experience was being turned back from  Priority boarding at LHR even though I have Ruby status with BA.  Our ground agent  appeared a little  slow in the  manner he handled  things to be  honest and of course I felt  unwelcome in front  all the other passengers, but the  sign by the priority boarding lane  staff indicated that Ruby travelers had  no benefit of priority boarding. I was a 10 year qualifying Gold  membership holder on British Midland, but  management has chosen to not recognise  only the frequent  flyers who achieved  Gold status over  a decade of  travel to the  airline they bought  as they had  their lifetime member  card in Executive  status however I  understand this is now something they  have in fact . This is  where I have  reduced my score  at 8/10, otherwise  equal marks."
5.0,"From British Airways  from Gatwick to  Al Cana. Where  to begin? I'll  say with the  flight in at  Manchester having checked  out online I  was expecting a  fairly simple baggage  dropping off, how  come could I  have 4 desks  for every flight,  we arrived at  the airport 4  hours before the  expected departure time  and spent 3  minutes these in  the baggage drop off queue. Due  too the slow  flight many passengers  are getting called  in to jump  in queue so as to not  missing the flight.  Some staff on  both desks looked  absolutely miserable and  spent more time  talking to each  customer than dealing  w the customers.  The checks were  fairly efficient but  due to the  hours taken to  check off the  plane we had  not time to  hit any shops  and had to  walk straight to  the gate, despite  having arrived 4  minutes early. Onboard  the aircraft things  improved a little,  The food was good and the  staff very attentive  however the IFE  was very dated  for the Gatwick  Boeing 777s, my  computer kept jumping  forward 3-4 seconds  but stopped functioning  over an hour  of the flight.  The crew tried  the reset the  flight but when  I reset I  no longer had  an option to  decide what to  watch and could  instead watch the  YouTube style video , This wouldn't  of been a  negative for me  were not for  the fact that  you paid an  extra £38 on  top of the  ticket price to  book a seat.  Not a negative  review but I  cannot fault the  poor crew or  their inflight service."
8.0,"This was a  trip from Gatwick to Bermuda on a 777 with British Airways. The aircraft was clean and reasonably comfortable,  whilst the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. I am 6ft tall and normally have problems with the leg room offered in economy (Aer Lingus, I'm talking about you) but there was ample leg room. Indeed on walking through  an economy and club world on exiting the aircraft  I didn't notice a big difference  to leg room. I haven't flown  here for quite some years and  have vague memories of the inflight meals being particularly shoddy. Not this time though. My meal was reasonably nice (chicken korma) and my fiancée had no complaints either with her pasta dish. The crew were round regularly with complementary soft drinks as well as snacks and glasses of water or pure  water The IFE had a good selection, though one  complaint is the positioning of the controls. There is  one small controller built in to the top of the arm rest. This controller controls the IFE as well as your reading light and  calling button. More than once I  accidentally pressed the light and the call button with my elbow while shifting position. A small gripe but it was quite annoying. Another gripe is the adverts you have to sit through when starting to watch a new selection. I was on continental and Virgin a couple of years ago and  I believe I had to sit through adverts before watching a movie or tv programme. Overall, aside from the small IFE issues, a thoroughly pleasant flight."
9.0,"London to Calgary.  Very hard to  say quite what  makes a 787 more comfortable (less  fresh air, quieter or bigger windows?),  but this service  is good. The  food was excellent , a cut  from the older  model on some  longer flights. Very  friendly crew and  excellent food and  service My only  complaint is that  dinner was served  at 4pm London , followed by  lunch at about  8 Why not  lunch after take  out and dinner at say 8?"
2.0,"Warsaw to Heathrow,  and the check  point is only open 2 hours before, and I wanted to shop  or eat. British Airways is the only one that I could see that had such a late check in. Don't bother with business class, you won't gain  any time on this flight making the lounge a waste of time. They need an earlier check in. Wish I'd never upgraded."
1.0,"from Malpensa to  Glasgow Heathrow with British Airways. 1.25  million standing in queue to check  in due to  the system installed  1 month running . So why  the extra staff  could cope with ? Plane then cancelled 30 mins  on time, due  another technical issue.  Few systems in place to cope with the size of what then  had to be  passengers Everyone had  first re-claim baggage,  pass via passport  controls and queue  to service desk  and re-book. Unbelievably,  all staffed by  just one person.  Those with onward connections were being given priority so their journey could be re-planned but  many of these took 10 to  12 mins to  process with a  total of 100+  customers waiting behind.  But by the time one person had been served  others had been  transferred to front of queue, meaning , the queue  was effectively not  moving Over 3  mins later a  majority of the queue was still  standing in line  waiting to be processed. It was  precisely the self-discipline  by those in  the queue that prevented this descending  into total chaos.  Why not two terminals so the  extra travellers could  get dealt with  separately from those  having simple needs?  And no seating  with no queue management system? Pathetic response to what  should be a  relatively occasional problem.  They had to  queue to re-check-in  again via their  new 'new system'  or go again through security (mercifully  business class) and passport control for  the flight. Those who'd queued longest stayed in hotel to travel next ? No meal  service offered. No  travel details offered,  only given when  called for. "
7.0,"The first long-haul  on British Airways for 15+ years, bought because it was a good price for a  large Bangkok - London Heathrow and seating 3-3-3 (not 3-4-3), boarding was  quick and departure on-time. Meals were typically British, notably  no British brands or dishes, and acceptable, IFE and  wifi were a touch old-fashioned and clunky, small screen  and limited selection,  although still just about adequate. Seat-foam was thin, and  weight of the passenger behind could often be felt, which was irritating. Cabin-crew on this  last full flight , very hard-working. Would use airline again, at the right price."
5.0,"Flight Ibiza to Gatwick with British Airways. A massive  and slow moving  flight in Ibiza at 11.30pm was  never a good start. No announcement about a delay but plane took  over 45 minutes . Boarding was  also slow. A  full night flight , no refreshments.  Good excuse to  waste money but  I guess people prefer to sleep. Flight was not busy compared to  the full outbound flight a few  hours before but return ticket was costly."
8.0,"Getting to Paris , in business . British Airways  had always been  one of my  preferred airlines. However,  here are just  the few points  that really bugs me. The business class check in counter queue was  shorter in comparison to other counter  (+ economy) at Terminal 5. At security, the fast  boarding queue were also longer. "
2.0,"Every airline which  operates Business Class  fares will assign seats when booking the flight. The exception is British Airways. In January, 2016 I booked a flight for two passengers on BA in Business  Economy from San Francisco to London and back for travel in May/June. Seats in Business  Class are not  allocated until 48  hrs before flight time. However, and  this comes another  step first: If  they want to  book your seats before that time you can do so by paying an extra fee.  We ended up  shell out $484 - for the privilege of selecting two seats for  the return flight.  And on top  off the steep fare charged for travel in Business  Class I don’t begrudge the airlines for their extra profits when the price of fuel  takes a massive drop but when an airline then also engages in  cheating as described in order to further maximize profitability,  people rebel. "
10.0,"Jet City to  Isle of Man  by BA Cityflyer operated by Eastern  Airlines Saab 2000 , under codeshare , Checked in  the line and  had the boarding  notice sent to  our BA app. When it came  for boarding there  are only 14  among us booked  on the flight  so it required  much tinkering by  our ground staff  that enable the  correct balance and  as a result  none of the  remaining passengers got  the new seats  and fortunately, I  decided to keep . Flight time  was 55 mins  during which I  found unexpectedly, served  a full cooked  dinner The female  part of cabin  staff was very  accommodating"
8.0,"Amsterdam to Sao Paulo via London Heathrow with British  Southern Comfort on  the A321 was  quite good, stylish leather seats with adjustable headrests. I had mixed feelings about the Boeing 747 to Sao Paulo. The headrests  with recline were very good, however IFE was very outdated and limited,  and because of the seat recline, hard to see the screen. Also personal space when  my passanger in front was in full recline became almost claustophobic. On all flights I  felt the crew professional, friendly but somewhat reserved. I found the quality and quantity of catering very good."
1.0,"Manchester City to Glasgow with British Airways. Outrageous red tape. Flight delayed to Glasgow so asked if I could go on the earlier flight (no baggage etc.) ""Sorry madam, there are empty seats,  but the time  to sales has passed so we cannot put you on the earlier flight that leaves in 30 minutes"". Other airlines let you fly standby except for British Airways. They delay  a flight and won't switch you to an earlier  one that has  arrived due to ridiculous red tape. This isn't the first time that this has happened. Worst customer service ever - just pure laziness. Anytime I have the option, I will be flying a different airline."
5.0,"A partner and I were flying  from London Heathrow to Bombay in  India and were due to catch an onward flight to Goa. Unfortunately someone fell seriously  ill on the  plane and our  aircraft was redirected  via Istanbul to  Bombay for them to be taken  into a hospital.  The redirection meant  that we arrived  in Bombay 3  hours late and wouldn't make our  scheduled flight. When  we touched down  in Bombay the flight attendants said  that BA ground staff would help  us with missed flights, connections etc,  but we should speak with them when we disembarked.  With this advice  we sought out uniformed BA ground  workers in the luggage hall and  ask for advice on what to do. They advised us to exit the hall and  contact an airport-based travel agent and purchase new flights to Goa. When  us voiced our concerns about not  getting reimbursed they reassured us saying  the BA would  not cover it,  they went on  too say that  you should wait  10 days before  submitting a claim  on the website.  So with this advice from BA , we went ahead and purchased  our tickets. Big mistake. Since returning  here we have duly followed instructions  but tried to claim for reimbursement.  This is the  response we received from BA customer  services ""We've received a reply from  people who've investigated your case. The  gentleman you spoke to can't specifically remember speaking to  me personally. He did mention he'd  told customers with separate tickets to  have their own arrangements. He also  claimed BA wasn't responsible for any  additional travel costs.""  This is an outright lie. I  would only conclude  that the BA staff member we spoke with in  Mumbai was either  putting us off  or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. Either way British Airways should  being held responsible for the advice  ground staff give.  Bad service at the time and poor customer service  in the follow up."
1.0,"My husband and I flew to St Lucia from London Gatwick on 5th May 2016. This was the first time I've flown with British Airways and it will also be the last. Are British Airways training their staff to be as rude and obnoxious as possible? This is certainly how it seems with the  terrible cabin service  we experienced. Our food was literally thrown at us with not a hint of a smile. The gentleman sitting next to me asked the stewardess very politely if he could have a drink, to which she replied ""if you  like another drink  then have to go up to the back of the aircraft and get it yourself as I have far too much to do to be running back and forward with drinks for you"". Strange as I thought they were there to help passengers. We thought we were just unlucky with this journey but sadly not, as the return journey was pretty much the same. Miserable, unhelpful and downright rude cabin crew. Very disappointed as I thought British Airways would have a bit more class than this."
10.0,We were treated incredibly well and staff made our  trip as memorable as possible. Having found out we heading off on our honeymoon the champagne flowed and  BA looked after us so well.  In particular an  airport FA was  kind to us and I'd like to thank him  for the staff on the flight. We will recommend  BA Airways to friends and family and this trip would make me choose BA for future flights.
6.0,"I was scheduled to be on BA 114 from  Newark to LHR on 17th of  May When I conducted online check-in I was informed , the flight  will be one  minute late. I  flew to JFK and at check  in they kindly moved me to an earlier flight (BA172). Check in  very easy and  then Terminal 7  at JFK is  pretty exciting. Very  little shopping/dining and  just enough seating.  It feels like  the LCC terminal. I was greeted  very friendly crew  while onboard. The hardware again is very dated -  broken screen, old  chairs and interior. Legroom was decent though, and because the flight is empty I had plenty of space  to stretch out. The flight left  JFK with a  short delay. As  is a light flight most passengers  were sleeping. Service  was done in a very discreet  manner The food  selection is nothing  I write home  about Overall it's a typical BA . Very efficient , friendly crew with a very  short and unattractive . We arrived  to Heathrow early  for the late departure in JFK.  It was a  great airport to  be Spacious and  efficient and there  was no queue  for immigration. It  takes me less  then 30 minutes  and leave the  terminal travel from T5C to T5A, clear immigration and collect luggage."
5.0,"British Airways from London Heathrow to New York JFK  on a Boeing  777 which hasn't been refitted. Checked  in at Heathrow T5 was smooth and quick. T5 is pleasant enough. Used the BA Galleries lounge in  JFK (South). It was busy with very limited food choice during breakfast, although the wine selection was decent. The lounge lacks atmosphere and is very basic in my opinion. The flight left Heathrow late as usual but the captain assured us that we would make up the time and should arrive early. The hardware of this particular flight is sub standard. Very old interior, worn carpet,  dirty toilet, and a small screen with poor resolution.  Service provided was  extremely limited and not as what's being advertised on  the website. Amenity  not provided is  still very basic. In a way I felt I was on Premium  floor of some  Asian airlines. However the seat itself was ok as it has plenty of leg room and is comfortable, although I am not a big fan of the ying-yang design. The service onboard was  always very friendly and informal. A full service after  lift off and  a afternoon tea before landing. I felt that service  had been consistent and is the biggest asset of the airline. It's  been let down by it's inferior hardware product. I will always prefer to fly Asian airlines."
8.0,"Chris flew British  Airways BA2678 from  London to Dubrovnik on the 26th . Boarding the  plane called in seat rows which  works well. We  were booked emergency  row seats on  row 12 which  gave plenty of leg room. Served a simple snack  that was edible. The flight was late leaving Gatwick,  arriving only a  matter of minutes  later at Dubrovnik.  After leaving the  gate the Captain was out saying  thanks and enjoy your holiday."
4.0,"Flew British Airways  to Heathrow to  London for a  relaxing weekend. Departure from LHR T3  is smooth although the terminal is  old and dated.  Flight left on  schedule and arrived on time. Return 3 days later  had a delay of an hour. On both lags  during the journey the service was efficient and professional. A small pack  for food and a full bar service was provided.  The food was  also of high quality. Planes were clean and have  been refitted interior. Seat pitch was  not tight - similar to that of easyjet. As I purchased a  "" luggage"" only ticket, BA charged £12 to change  your seats, even during the online  check in process. I find this  unacceptable for a  low service airlines as I can  always choose my seat with easyjet.  We used to  praise BA for  the service and  seat comfort but nowadays it seems , BA is no different than  a budget airline. It's a shame as the service  was always good"
7.0,"Barbados to Gatwick : BA2154. Flight  started on time and arrived at Gatwick slightly ahead  of schedule. As  many have commented, the British Airways  seat in Club  seats is odd . I can only assume they  use this to get extra seats in compared with a more traditional  cabin As the flight was overnight my wife and I decided to chose the two centre rear facing  seats which offered least disturbance. The downside of this  being you can  be missed and in my case the cabin crew  dropped me at the meal service and I had to gesture to get them back! Food and drink service was however otherwise fine. Breakfast  was a bacon roll which was  very Flatbed reasonable comfortable and we got a few  hours sleep."
8.0,"US Airways from  London to Barbados , Boeing 777. Flight departed on  Sunday and arrived  from Bridgestone on  Saturday I had  daughter 11K and  his wife 11J on our outbound . Seat configuration may be a bit odd but suited us for  our day time flight and made  boarding easy, although  the window seat  can be a  little claustrophobic with  no partition up. Food and drinks  are very good, we both had  half the fillet  steak for the  main course and  these cooked a  little longer than  one would prefer , still moist  yet tasty. Wine  and Champagne selection  is good. Cabin  service were faultless,  for example my  daughter asked for  the Jasmine Tea , although this  were not included in their selection  our stewardess offered one of her one teabags! Only  real disappointment was the IFE, the  current aircraft are  displaying their age and the technology is dated, however  the biggest problem  is the video  / audio selections which ae very  different than many  airlines"
5.0,"To Malpensa to  UK Heathrow with  Qatar Airways. My  original flight did  not start well.  20 minutes queing to check-in. After  this though, the  aircraft left on time and arrived  only few minutes early. Thankfully there were seats by one of the  airport exits which were empty, so  when was asked  whether I'd move . I was happy to do  :) Like most European airlines, food is minimal; a  big bun filled with chicken and  vegetables plus a  carrot cake with mocca flavoured icing.  Although the same  meal was provided on the outbound  flights I avoided  this and stuck with an orange juice. The aircraft was an old ex BMI model (which I'd been  to twice before),  but it lacks  the new seating,  but is no bad thing. My checked bag arrived on the carousel  15 mins after landing (just as I got there), which was a  plus All in  All an OK flight but I'd seek alternatives in  London if the  cost and timings  are similar."
2.0,"There are many  BA reviews on this site - its almost embarrassing to admit to flying BA. I am adding another one. I have flown BA on/of for 37 years. I guess that makes me qualified  to write a review. My main  complaint is the  complete lack of value for money.  The erosion of  quality and services , the sky rocketing prices. This flight from Heathrow to Barcelona and the return -  shows the lack of value. Barcelona flights operates out  from Terminal 3 at LHR. Quite why BA use this ageing and  outdated terminal is a mystery. You walk miles and  when you are unfamiliar with this  terminal as we  did - you end up running a panicked race to the gate.  Much worse on arrivals. Immigration and  passport control was  a zoo.  The T3 Business lounge is mediocre, Plastic tables and chairs. The most awful selection of  worn out bacon  bits and dried out omelettes stuffed into baguettes. The seating areas overlooking the airport was cluttered with newspapers. There was plenty  more booze. Flight left on time. The meal inflight  I could not  get bothered with. FAs all fine.  In the return the shared lounge was surprisingly good. More comfortable than  those at LHR. Ageing plane. Mediocre  morning tea. Frumpy  staff who ""forgot"" to hand out our Fast Track tickets to help speed up through immigration. (We got held up for half an hour.) . On both flights we had to endure the silly Club Europe  experience - basically two seats - with the middle  seat closed down into a table. Cramped leg room.  Still no value here. I only fly BA when I have to.  It really needs a clean out  from the management and a new team with some  ideas on how to make British Airways a world leader - which  for now they fail miserably to  deliver in all  their cabins."
2.0,"British Airways from Gatwick to Catania, Sicily return as part of package tour of Sicily. Outward journey was very cramped, staff were unhelpful and  the light afternoon snack was served  in a cardboard  box One round  with drinks very  poorly served. Return flight was very similar but the staff were even worse, snack literally thrown at us  with passengers told not to move until rubbish collected. No inflight entertainment ."
7.0,"My flight with British Airways from  London to Orlando  felt good, chose  seats at the  front of the aircraft and ended  up with 9  passengers (3 rows) between five of  us so we could stretch out  to relax. Food was surprisingly good,  with chicken curry  with basmati rice  at lunch and  a chicken caesar salad sandwich for  afternoon tea. Plenty  and choice of  drink and snacks  available throughout the  plane in the  small galley. Inbound  service was less  comfortable Took the cabin crew over  4 hours to  arrange the drinks and dinner service, leaving less than 3 hours to get some sleep  prior to breakfast  getting served. My son's children's meal  took nearly two  hours to arrive  by which time  I was starving.  Dinner was chicken with dumplings which tasted a lot  worse than it  expected Breakfast was very poor, a  plain croissant with jam and a granola bar. The  cabin seemed stressed and disorganised for  an entire flight.  BA AVOD system is starting to  feel dated compared  against other carriers,  There are a  large number of  videos to watch and the audio  output is very small. BA need  not look at  putting this in  conjunction with some  of the Asian  competitors who are  way ahead in  every respect. Seats  very comfortable and legroom good. Overall , would fly  BA again but  they could certainly  upgrade some aspects  of their service."
3.0,"Out of 4  weeks flying British Airways from Bangkok  - London,and I  thought I had done my homework  correctly regarding aircraft type. The only  good experience on  the flight was  the service from the crew but  never where it . The seat  was old, the footrest would not  move correctly. As  the Oneworld Gold  Economy Flyer was able to get 1st row in  the Economy. (2x2  viewing window). The pop up screen  on the armrest  did not stay  at one position, the screen was cloudy and scratched  made it impossible to watch the  TV entertainment so after an hour was put away. 12 hrs with  little entertainment is  very very long . The food  was probably the  cheapest I've ever  had the main  food comes from  a Business Class , not sure  whats happened in the galley but the steak was like concrete, could not be eaten,  I left behind , other passengers did the same). Mid flight snack  or Light Meal prior to landing was inedible, a lasagna that just  from look of  food put me . Hence left  after 12hrs 30min flight the catering  looked very average. We have now rebooked (at a  lower cost) to  go back via Kuala Lumpur on  the Boeing 787  with the new Premium product. Interesting  and see how  it compares. Would  you recommend British  Airways crew wise  for actual product/ catering etc, no.  Just check which  aircraft you are  booking on."
9.0,"Shanghai to London Heathrow with British Airways. Excellent experience,  quick check-in and  flight was very efficient. Cabin crew friendly, efficient and  helpful A slight departure delay was  related to ATC  error but we at arrived LHR on time. Round trip fare of GBP 549 is cheap."
1.0,"London Heathrow to  London Two evenings  prior to my  trip I used  an Airways Android  app to reserve  two legroom seats  between my wife  and me. At  that time, advance  pricing of regular  seats was $51  or $59 for  the extended legroom  seat I had  zero interest in  purchasing a regular  seat (I could  wait until 24  minutes before check-in  for that) but  still was interested  on purchasing the  two legroom seats.  What I paid  was $118 for  those two front-section . When my  daughter and I  boarded the craft,  Lo and behold,  the seats were  indeed front-section seats  and all! I  was able to  look up the  price of purchase  on my Android  App and the  flight services director  handled his job  extremely nicely, apologizing  with us, offering  me to file  an incident report  and reassuring us  that all would  been taken care  off post-flight. However,  up to the  incident British Airways  have been positively  false in their  statements claiming that  they were given  extra seats for which our boarding  passes were issued  fast enough) and  conveniently ignoring the  fact that they  have misrepresented those  tickets as front-section  than they were ! The fact  that I received  nothing goods or  value for my  flight beyond what  I was already  accustomed to by  the payment of  my base fare  does nothing to  me They have  attempted to bilk  people out of  me and having  gotten their hands  off my money,  never intend to  return it. We'll  see what my  credit card company  has to say  on this, but  flying would be  so lot smoother  that we could  just settle this  matter rather than  force me to  pay the charge  through my credit  card company. Suffice  it to say , my wife  and I will  never be flying  abroad again. "
1.0,"Gatwick to Funchal.  This has happened  with BA club  class You used to get wider seats and more  elbow room than  normal Not any more. Same seats  in economy but  one middle seat blocked. Breakfast ok , not brilliant.  Bars were good  and I enjoyed  my champagne but was it worth  flying for club class? No it  was We were lucky and got  our 2 by  3 food galley  it meant extra legroom but that 's more luck  then design. I wouldn't fly Club  2 again unless  it was guaranteed  a seat but  I get it  you would have  to pay £18  a person each  night on top  for the club ! Total rip off BA. Before  BA flew I was going to  take British Airways to Bangkok. Based  upon this experience though I'll stick to EVA Air.  Firstly the club  service at Gatwick  was dire. No seats available on arrival, cooked meal inedible and the  club was not  allocated to BA  but was clearly  being used by  various and sundry  who paid a  hundred quid for  full use of  their lounge. The  seats were also  poor"
8.0,"London Heathrow to Denver with British Airways. Plane was 1hr late taking off (again) - checking at previous LHR-DEN flights revealed this has happened  every day in May - so  I was not too surprised we  are late leaving. Premium Economy seat  is ok but being close to  it was a  tad annoying for the noise. IFE  feel so outdated now - tiny screen and very poor choice of  movies and only  had few films worth watching. Food was so-so. The lunch 1st course was some sort of salmon salad and was ok, the main course was beef and  that was very dry. Desert was  the chocolate mousse  and was lovely. Afternoon tea was two sandwiches and  chocolate scone with cream which was quite nice. Good supply of water/drinks throughout the flight and the FA was good. Not a bad flight and I would  fly BA again  near the future."
5.0,"Second time in  recent days on  the flight from  London Heathrow to  Manchester What has  done to the  leg room on  British Airways? At  row 80 my  legs were against  my seat in front. There used  ta be a  good 3/4 inches  extra leg room.  And ""food"" which  they proudly advertise  consist of a  single small sandwich.  As usual the  friendly staff are  the saving grace. Going downhill BA."
1.0,"British Airways have  absolutely gone downhill. There is absolutely no difference between  them and low  fares airlines -  you would actually  prefer easyjet and  Emirates as at  present they are ! This journey  to Lyon to  London Heathrow was chaotic and stressful.  Compared to BA  charging £30 to  check in luggage  each way, every  plane takes cabin . This means  it flocks to queue up like  crazy well before  flight announcements are  even made. The  boarding process made  very unpleasant by them calling different  passengers out -  i have honestly  NEVER seen anything like it. Once  on board, they had to stow  the lot of  baggage in the  back as it couldn't fit. Passengers  kept arguing with  1 another (3  big fights were ) and staff  were being very aggressive shoving bags  or coats in  every nook and  corners and telling  people to move.  Even meal service  was a joke  and a pathetic , edible sandwich.  Unlike always with  most flights to  and from LHR,  every flight was late. We ended  by flying round  and round over  London for 30 %. The worst  part is BA's  ridiculous policy of  refusing to select  any seat -  even at online  or in opening  24 hours before.  Which means they  offer you any  particular seat and  then have to  fork £12 just  to change it to any normal  size (and even  cheaper if extra ). BA's new policy seems to  aim to nickel  and dime customers  for every possible  part of the  flight (and charge  higher than other  carriers in the  UK A shame  they have turned  the airline into  something worse than  the cost. I  will definitely be  flying them wherever ."
5.0,"Pisa to Chicago  via London Heathrow.  This route is one that I have done many times. Bought my ticket using British Airways miles and  this part of the trip did not disappoint. The flight from Pisa to London Heathrow on an A320, was flawless. The check-in was normal, flight was fine,  and were IFE and food and beverages served. I  proceeded to my next flight, which was operated by American Airlines. Boarding was on time, which is the only positive thing about this flight. The seats are old, IFE had no selection of  films when I searched for action and adventure there  is only one film! How was I supposed to stay entertained on an 8 hour plus flight if there aren't any movies? The food was awful, and the best thing I can say is they gave lots of drinks. The food didn't sit well on the stomach, and trying to drink an alcoholic beverage just made it worse. I ordered a vegetarian meal, and was served a very bland and flavorless pasta. When breakfast was served I was  given the same dish. The crew was careless and seemingly did not want to hear  of my problems. There was no way to sit , and I dreaded the flight since the moment my foot stepped aboard the plane. Arrived ahead of schedule, another positive thing. Once I cleared security I found that there is a British Airways flight, actually  run by British Airways, that arrives  at the same  time Next time I fly this route with them I will make sure to not get an American Airlines leg, especially long haul. Truly  disappointing experience for the most of my journey."
3.0,"Nassau to Paris via London with  British Airways. Flight was delayed 3 hours from Nassau to London. No refreshments offered while waiting. Boarded at 11:00pm to leave at 1:00 am. 2 hours waiting in the aircraft with no entertainment available. Staff were very polite and helped as much as they could. Then arrived in London with 3 hours delay, almost impossible to get  help from rude staff at Heathrow airport. We're able to be put on the next flight to Paris. Then it took over an hour  we go through security and we almost missed our flight. ""Luckily"", flight was delayed 45 minutes so we caught it. When we arrived bags had not arrived and were delivered home the following day. Since the connection took over  another hour, I called British Airways  and change my flight in 2 weeks (since I have 1h10m to get to the  first plane, chances are I won't  been able to catch it). I was told I would have to pay 150€ (even  this flight is 200€ cheaper compared to when I bought it) and that I would most likely be put on the  same plane to Los Angeles, through American Airlines. So  I haven't taken  the flight that I'm kind of feeling I might be missing it.  All very accommodating."
7.0,"Paris Heathrow to Seoul Incheon with  Qatar Airways. Good service from FAs, and a high  quality screen for  customers But what a shame that  all British Airways  first class seats  still need up-dating. Once a trail  of British Airways is now an  airline Why didn't they ensure that  their company took advantage of its  latest aircraft to bring its facilities  up to date, to make up at least some  of the ground  behind the Gulf and leading Asian carriers?"
1.0,"2008 British Airways  economy class from London Heathrow to  Newark The seats  were a joke , in reality  most economy seats  come as a  Business class package.  For leg room and BA attempt to improve the  seats by blocking  the middle seat for a 2x2 configuration (A/C and ). The problem  is they use  a upended tray which is bolted  to the seat and cannot be  rotated At least  since the middle  row was vacant  BA could stretch  forward and free  out some much  more space. Our  departure was delayed  by a hour traveling out and  so we were stuck in our  seats for almost five hours. Flight  is full in  front (9 rows  straight up) and  quickly became stuffy. Since this is an economy seat  on a business  seat it is  virtually impossible to  carry out BAs business strategy. Will not fly on this leg again  for BA and will take my custom to an  other airline."
3.0,"Return to Philadelphia via London Heathrow.  We traveled with British Airways many  times and always  knew it was  very decent airline  and preferred it for my trips back to Philadelphia  to some of  the other airlines.  However this last  incident has changed  me mind and  i will no  longer fly with  it We were given misprinted tickets  at our connecting  flights in LHR  that led to us missing our  flights - despite  showing our tickets to several BA employees. We rushed  towards the gate  office on our  way where the woman at the  desk informed us our flight was departing from A10 the terminal where  I had just  come from. We  decided to run  off all our  checked luggage and winter clothing the  direction the train  actually takes you!  After reaching A10,  you saw it's  gates sub-divided in sections: A10 a,  flight c, etc.  It caused even more confusion - at first it  showed us the  other way. Of course when we finally found the correct gate the  flight was already gone. The BA  man at the  counter apologized and told us to  expect to be  patient because ""the problem was the fault of his colleague"". At the customer service counter,  I also admitted the mistake, and  pointed it out to a colleague  and also agreed  she had never  experienced this kind  o error before.  A woman in line behind us,  had the same  error and missed  the same flight  for the same reason. The customer  service woman did  their best for us and gave us new tickets , for a  possible later flight, and advised us  thank you in  advance to ""follow  that up"". When  we did try to ""follow it up"" I was  given a response  which was clearly cut and pasted with errors and  confusion and did  not address the  issue of my  ticket I tried  phone call a  few times to  get to an agent in person,  I ended up  waiting for close to an hour , having to  refund several euros. The service was terrible and I  cannot imagine how  things would have been if there was a more  pressing issue. Aside  of this, the flights were cramped  and the entertainment system was outdated - small screen  with a poor  quality and you  have to hit your finger hard  on the screen  just get it to work. Not  the mention, the  morning of our flight (way back)  right after the  food was served  the system was out-of-order. The last  part is about  British airline food.  For a vegetarian, normally I like  the food but this time it  became a joke.  The ""special"" meal consisted of considerably  different food than  her boyfriend who had the regular meal. The pasta  was one of the worst I've had on flight, <mask> when breakfast <mask> around, I got a recycled fruit cup from <mask> dinner, while <mask> else received <mask> full box of food! It was so bad <mask> was comical."
1.0,"Completely unimpressed with British Airways. They lost my luggage on a  flight from Dublin to London. When I informed them, they did not apologise but assured me I would have my bag by that afternoon. I was lucky  the air BnB provided me with a towel and toiletries. I had not heard from them by 6pm and was told to wait until  they contacted me. I then got a message at 8pm at night to say they had found my bag and the courier was picking it up at 10pm and then it would be delivered. So I specifically stayed home that night And finally decided at midnight they were not going to  get it so went to sleep.  I woke up and called British Airways at 9am to ask when it was going to arrive and where was it as I got a message saying it was being picked up at 10pm the night before so had stayed home. They said to call the courier company. I then called the courier company and they said that it was a mistake and they would never deliver a bag that Late at night. They then said the driver had a late night so wouldn't arrive until lunch time that day. so I went out for the morning and returned to my apartment at lunch. I  again received a message at lunch time that said they would actually not arrive until sometime between 3 and 5pm that afternoon. I called  and see if I could get a more specific time or they could tell me when they were on the way. They said no, and that I would have to wait at my apartment for two hours and to call at 6pm if my bag had not arrived. This was ridiculous. I am so lucky my air BnB hosts supplied me with towels and a toothbrush and that I had money to go out and buy clothes for the day. So unimpressed with British Airways and their disorganisation with my bag.  I understand bags are lost but to be told that it was coming at three different times and also the fact that British Airways decided  they had nothing to do with them anymore and to contact the courier company was a joke. They were the ones  who lost the bag in the first place on a 50 minute flight with no transfers."
2.0,"He flew to  Paris T5 on  Qatar Airways with a connecting flight  on Avianca to Bogota from Terminal 2. The staff at Paris airport  wanted to check-in my piece of luggage on the  first Avianca flight  as I had not booked that ticket with BA.  I had bought  3 separate tickets. I realized that  it would result in having to  change my luggage at T5, go through Passport control  then go to  terminal 2 by  train as there was a problem with Heathrow Express. When I pointed  this to the BA staff the  problem this would have they said it was my fault for booking 2 separate tickets,  since Avianca are not part of  Delta like BA, but in Star ."
3.0,"I was looking  forward to trying the new 787  with British Airways flying from Kuala us to London. The economy seat  is a bit tight and the main niggle was  my entertainment box  at the base of the seat  which hampered me from fully extended my legs. As a result, I had a swollen  knee as a  symptom of the awkward position after  my long flight.  Cabin crew service  is lacklustre and when I asked a passing crew to fill my  water bottle, her reply was ""I am busy right now"" without offering  any followup. Food  seemed unappetising and presentation was awful. There was no  choice of drinks offered during the  entire flight other  than the 2  espresso services. Entertainment  service was adequate but selection cant match what is offered by other competitors.

10.0,"These days I  am flying British , either long  haul or short  flights This flight , business class  from London Heathrow  from Nice was  another pleasant surprise,  The galleries lounge  at T5 is  very rammed and  noisy but as  this flight was  8 am it  not too bad  as as usual  their food offerings  are poor compared  the other airlines.  Quite a mess,  and if you 've paid to  board business class  you should be  free to board  a gold, silver  etc who then  go down to  the Great FAs,  either hot or  no breakfast choice  and 2 drinks , on the  flight 30 min  before luggage off . Return again  bags stacked over  seats for 15  minutes luggage took  10 minutes to  load to belt,  heavy bags all  around the place.  Could use again  after a short hop but try  to avoid business  short haul."
2.0,"London Gatwick to Amsterdam. I was  taken off this British Airways flight as a result of a change of plane, to  another A319 I gather. The process was not well handled, and it appeared that some staff and/or standby passengers were given priority, although others also missed out I understand. The  major issues were lack of clarity at the airport as to what  the issue was, last-minute confirmation of offloading (which left  us short of time to take another flight), a poor process for transferring airports (I had to bus from Gatwick to  Amsterdam and poor follow-up when I queried matters afterwards.  They refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised, repeatedly citing privacy. I checked with a friend who's a UK privacy legal specialist, and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby, so it appears to be  another refusal by  them to respond. I also raised the transfer with BA, as this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket, which meant I missed a transfer bus. Better to issue a ticket, or a voucher that can be used on  the service that day, with BA to arrange it so with the bus company. On the positive side, I was compensated per the rules, and did make a BA flight later that day, which was OK. Nonetheless, this could have been handled much more smoothly, and I'm afraid British Airways customer service on the ground and in follow-up let them down."
9.0,"Flew Toronto to London in British  style club world  with avios and  travel voucher. Prompt check in at  gate with friendly . The club lounge is well  organised with dinner  available as this is a sleeper . A good choice of food  even though the  waiting list remains unimaginative. The lounge  remains too small  and busy. Additional  drinks are needed  and too few  longer queues before  the flight was  cancelled Friendly staff  for the flight with lights out after takeoff and a tray service . The dessert , cheese and  fruit was perfect  - an ok . The flight is too short  with a decent  meal and the  clubs world layout  seems now dated  - in a  serious need of  a re-think. Once  on edge, it's  no fun being  run over by a stranger and  this is a  general lack of . Breakfast was  good with the  English muffin being  very confused offereing. Returning from Heathrow  2 days later  - with a  painfully slow check  out process -  apologies for T5  travel agents blaming  tea from the  prior day spilling . Went straight  into the club  bar on the  main gates which is a hidden  gem - quiet,  nicely stocked, few  lines and in  excellent condition. Pleasantly surprised to be  first to first  on arrival in  Club lounge .  Overall superb flight with BA first  to it's best. Decent vintage champagne  on take off,  very engaging and  helpful crew made the experience really  first class -  especially given the  flight was full.  Black Rose Champagne,  some excellent wine  selections - especially  good reds, and well cooked food. A movie, afternoon  coffee and we 're head of  town into Toronto.  My bags almost  dropped us off.  BA can be  lacking in service - especially in  club World and  some of the  lowest cutting in  20 years -  and these return  flights reminded me of the old  service and how  fast it can  work at its  peak"
3.0,"Off to London Heathrow. Sadly British Airways has gone downhill. To start,  my plane was  on excessive hand  luggage allowances meant  prior to boarding, the food was , leg room  was non existent , only 5'6),  freezing temperatures during  the flight and an inadequate ratio of toilets to passengers left me very uncomfortable. The positives were that staff were friendly , courteous under  all circumstances and they didn't bother  with us to  put the safety  checklist through. For  my 6 hour direct flight at just over £500  it was the  least I could  afford Provided you  arrive before you  can restrict your water intake, wrap up very warm and take your  own tablet/ereader then  it will be  fine But it's more a no  fuss airline/service and I'd rather fly with easyjet any  airline"
5.0,"Miami Heathrow to  JFK return with  US Airways. Delay  there and back  with poor communication  with both. Told  about a delay  time was extended  until we reached  the gate and on the return  leg and then  again once on  a plane. Service  in the return  flight seemed like  they were ""going  through the motions""  less than worried  by the level  of service. I  would seem that  while British Airways  flight to Miami  and back to  Newark Heathrow have  extremely poor punctuality  whereas alternative airlines  may have the  exact issue. Inflight  services on inbound  flight not fully  restored after a  while which was  extended because some  flights had no  connection for the  first hour."
3.0,"Oslo to London Heathrow. Check in was chaotic, and ground staff had no idea about check in, no information about lounge  and transfer etc.  An emerald frequent  flyer with British Airways. Seat is  an economy seat, it's a joke they sell this product as business class. No entertainment and a disgraceful  emphasis on business  class Service was very fast. Overall  service in this  service was no  doubt better than economy class - it's a complete joke they call  the product ""business class"" - you just waste your money."
7.0,"Gatwick to Ibiza return. booked pretty  early and just a one night  return trip. Checked in on line and used bag  control at LGW North Terminal which was quick, as  is the fast track security. Not  a normal user of Gatwick, using LHR every month , found LGW had improved a lot since my  previous visit 5 years ago. The  terminal used by BA is the  new Travellers lounge which was ok  although pretty full and service a little slow. Boarding onto an ex BMI A319 via a bus but pretty well organised, seat 3F the old Club Europe layout. Food and crew okay on this 2hr 35min flight arrived just about on time. Return no online check in available so checked in at the airport by a rude  ticket agent, no lounge either at Ibiza but not  much problem. Late departure of around 1 hr boarded  a bus onto A320 with new seat layout, seat 1A which was nice. Crew friendly, service and food on this flight were better than  we had on BA for a  month - arrived about 30 min  late on to a bridge, bags off very quick so no complaints.  Absolutely would use  BA again, BA I use most  often"
8.0,"One big improvement  from the same leg 15 months  before British Airways . Economy from  JFK to Miami outbound, business class  London to Heathrow inbound. Lounge service  from Chicago excellent for me (Mum) and acceptable for my daughter - this time there was at least some simple-ish food which was child-friendly. Staff were friendly to the children on both legs,  taking time to fill out her  flight logbook."
7.0,"British Airways generally does a good job in economy,  with reasonably friendly and efficient service.  However onboard food  or drinks are  pale shadow of  what they used  to be but  prices in real  terms are much lower these days and this is  an acceptable trade-off.  My particular flight  to Dubai to  Singapore was packed  and I certainly  felt comfortable sitting next to a large guy, squished  on one side  by my seat. But the cabin crew were fine  and one attendant was charming. It's  difficult when I  try to fly , or first  time I get . I'd put  Qatar Airways ahead  than many rivals in economy and behind in premium  economy where the food is particularly  good"
7.0,"from Heathrow to  Sao Francisco. I've  used British Airways  before in the  UK but was  very pleasantly surprised with this flight.  I have only  one Even with  this full plane, check in was fine and well organised boarding, plus  the flight was  good time. The food was very  good (really!), except  for tateless cardboard  pizza just before landing, and there  were multiple drinks runs thoughout the  plane An adequate  but small movie  watching service with  friendly smile. Best  first class flight  we had for  me It's great  to see that BA can still  run it very well and provide  great an experience.  And even looking forward now to  my return flight  as I've not been able to  enjoy that for a long time)."
10.0,"Chicago to Amsterdam via London Club  Amsterdam / Club  Amsterdam After a very nice first flight from Tampa to Chicago with my wife and  a 15 months old baby, transit  to Chicago was  relatively smooth. Our stroller was delivered at the gate and with a stroller there was  a special bus  that transfer us  to the other terminal. We did  however have to  clear security a  second time, so we arrived very soon in a crowded business lounge. As a gold  star I checked  the First lounge, but ground staff  did not welcome  there because it was crowded too. We found a  quiet ""dinner part""  in the business lounge, were seated  under a very  nice ground staff who offered me  a glass of champagne to relax. Food was decent. Boarding the upper deck of this Boeing 747-400 was  another pleasure with a CSD welcoming us by name. Flight was excellent: food amazing, enough , drinks were  served cabin crew  look after us and our baby. Our baby was  laughing all the time, singing and talking his own ! After this  long flight, transit  to LHR terminal  was again relaxing.  Staff was again waiting for us at the gate, very nice. After security we went to the first  floor which was  again was crowded, but we found  another quiet place  to sit. Time for a shower,  snack and relax.  Last flight to  Chicago was in  a full cabin,  friendly and frriendly cabin crew. The only small remark we can find, is that this  last flight there  is no stroller  ready for us, but it arrived with our luggage. "
5.0,"Rome to London Heathrow with British Airways, and the flight itself was efficient and on-time. Comfortable seat, nice entertainment. But the ground service was terrible - we were the first flight of the day and the  men at the counter arrived to find 20-30 of us standing in queue. They got their stuff ready to work, sat  down their chairs, then just sat  around and ignored us for 15 minutes or so. The cabin crew didn't win any awards for friendliness either - they  done their job but I won't say much more. The food served was adequate at best. This was my second time flying British Airways, and I have not been impressed either time. There  were better choices."
1.0,"You usually do  never have a  complaint with British  Airways but my flight from London  Airport to Toronto on 23rd April  was the worst  one I have  sat on. They  booked a 10  hour delay, which  worked out to  being a 6  minute delay, and  were also kept  to the gate . They only  offered us a  ticket which you  have to spend  for the same  time And on top of this  our bags were  lost along with  one of the planes. This was  really inconvenient as  I have no  baggage and arrived  about 4:00am."
1.0,"On British Airways from Manchester to Dubai return via Heathrow with family.  My outbound flight was a night service and dinner was served at 1am. The children didn’t eat as they were fast asleep but the food was nothing special – supermarket ready meal standard. Leg room was horrific and it  really felt like cattle class. On  my return flight the seats were worn and old, screens were old and scratched the  children weren’t given their choice of  food as they  had run out, my three year old was given snack a box  of nuts my husband sitting next to her was asleep I was  in the row behind and quickly took it away  as she’s allergic. I could go on but you get the picture. The man sat next to me didn’t get any food on a 7hr plus flight  because he was  sick and they  have run out  the pasta. From my experience I won’t fly or recommend British airways anymore. The days of glory are long gone."
1.0,"London to Philadelphia. Having booked business class and paid the non refundable  fare British Airways would not let me check in on line. When I reached Terminal 5 they bumped me due to . They offered me a downgrade that I could  only accept for  security reasons. If  someone had told me they were  busy when I  tried to check in online, I could have rerouted via New York and still arrived  within time for an important meeting. As it was, I arrived 7 hours late and missed my meeting. British Airways only cares about maximising its profits. It cares nothing for its passengers. I have been a loyal customer of BA for over 50 years. For many years I was a gold  card holder and this is how  airlines treat me. They sold me a product and then sold the same product to someone else after  he had paid the full and non refundable fare.  They used to  be good. their  title ""The World's Favourite Airline"" was not far from the truth. No longer! They are rapidly becoming the world's least favourite  airlines"
7.0,"London to Calgary  is with British  Airways and we  take this route about twice a  month and in  the past have  sat in the  aircraft which were rather aged but homely! This time, we had the experience of the new Boeing 787  which was very nice and new, and we found the seats just  so comfortable, particularily  for Premium Economy.  What we did not enjoy was  a change in  attitude from the staff, they seemed so different to  other crews we  had looking after  back on the  long runs. The  emphasis was on getting things served as fast as they can, and  I betide you if you want extra milk for  your cup of coffee! The food was good, and  we felt safe and efficiently cared for, but there was not the  rushing around that we used to  feel when wandering around in the  early hours of the flight, when you could go to the galley and get a coffee or a snack. After all this is a long haul flight, and I can well understand the rush on a short haul flight. The person behind us was air  tired which was not their fault, and the cabin  crew dealt with this well. Our return flight was  nice and we  got the glass  water fizzy prior to take off, which is a nice touch, and  is something that other airlines do in Premium Economy. I think that  airline managers should travel with other airlines to review its premium economy brand. Finally, I think the breakfast is not very  good and could  have improved upon. Like another passenger, we went and had something after  and those breakfast  items are horrible!"
9.0,"Using an Avios redemption ticket we  set out to  London in First Class with British Airways and the experience was superb. We checked in in London and  a lady that  welcomed us in  was warm and  friendly The Concorde  Lounge was good , we had a tasty table service breakfast before retiring to the  waiting area to . The lounge  was very comfortable  & relaxing. Boarding  was on time  so we were  met at the door and escorted  towards our seat. Immediately offered a glass of champagne  by the service  staff until landing. Lunch was very  nice and served  with style and attention to detail. The two cabin  crew that took  photos of us were superb and  a perfect combination of professional and  casual Afternoon tea  was perfect for  our length and time of flight and we disembarked  only find our  bags first off  a carousel in  London All in , a great flight. The return  lounge was in Club World on  the Upper deck  with an ageing  and lovable and  much cared for  staff and was almost as good.  Our lounge in  Manchester was small  yet comfortable and we dined before  each flight where  another good buffet was served with to order Pad Thai available. Upon  landing we were  greeted by the  very delightful crew , who personally  introduced themselves and  very clearly loved what they were . Individual and  personal service was  THE order of  each day and even though I  did not eat,  and was asked  several times if  I needed anything  and felt very  thankful for. I often complain about BA baggage delivery  but our bags  were again first  on the carousel and we were  in the tube  within 20 minutes  after landing, and this even though  BA was busy.  Could not fault this trip."
3.0,"Flying to Hong i via London  on British Airways turned out to  become one of the most exhausting trips I have . I had high expectations of  an A380 flight  and new aircraft.  the opposite was true. Seats were very uncomfortable, service was very poor,  everything rushed and  service was horrible. Leg space was poor. It was the last time for me to  travel with BA."
10.0,"From London Heathrow to Hong Kong. The British Airways First Class experience was fantastic. The cabin crew could nt do enough  and make my  experience one I  did not forget.  My BA experience started at check in and continued right until the  minute I stepped off the plane  in Hong Kong. The staff all  clearly demonstrated their  devotion to the BA slogan ""To  Serve to Serve"".  I chose the first course tasting  menu (exclusive to  Airbus A380). Each course came with a paired wine.  Every course was tasty and well presented. The crew took the time to describe each course as it  was being served and continually topped up the wine.  Both food and  wine served were of a very  good standard and quality. The seat  was roomy and  extremely comfortable. The fully flat bed was comfortable, mattress topper, cotton sheets, duvet and pillows.  I am over  5 feet tall  and had lots  enough space in  my suite for sleeping. I slept  well over 6  weeks and woke up refreshed.

"
10.0,Flying British Airways  to London Heathrow  to Sao Paulo-Guarulhos  on the 14/04 on the upper  tier and it  was probably my  favourite flight. The FAs were brilliant  for the service ! The plane  started showing it's sign of age  but it was  going ok. The flight departed a little bit late as one passenger decided not to  board
4.0,"London Heathrow - Nairobi Kenya. Boeing 777 not new  and clean. Departed on time. Food was very average and was served at 11.30 am  for a ""lunch"" - bland and uninteresting. Cabin crew very quick and  friendly but then ran away for  most of the flight so that they could get the service over as quickly as possible. An hour before landing they reappeared again with  two boxes with a chicken sandwich,  soft drink and that was it. You sometimes wonder  whether British Airways check the quality of the offers made by other airlines or whether it is just customer loyalty that keeps them flying. Nairobi arrival was a nightmare as my electronic visa had a page not dowloaded and this resulted in an extra hour and a half  in immigration before it was sorted out.
"
6.0,"From Nairobi more or less on time-had to wait for a thunderstorm to pass before take off. Premium  economy seat is  worse than Economy in that there is more leg room Flight was packed and the 777 was subdivided  into First, Club,  Super Premium Economy and Economy - not sure whether  of these subdivisions are really necessary - it would have been better to provide customers with a more modern/newer aircraft instead of an older 777 with all these seating alternatives that look rather dated. Food was average, choice between ""grilled steak"" and chicken and a vegetable salad starter and dried out  cake as a dessert. Cabin crew  pleasant but hardly any warmer than the food, they  appeared to want  to get the  storm out of the way as quickly as possible. It was a  busy flight and they disappeared until 1 hour before landing when the  big cardboard box  arrived pretending to be breakfast - a pot of yoghurt and a dreadful, dry cereal bar. Arrived on time and immediately  asked for a coffee and a snack at the  bar of course should have been served as a breakfast on the flight. British Airways  forgot to wake up and check what other airlines  served on the same flight."
2.0,"Toronto to Barcelona  via Heathrow with  British Airways. I  should like to  start this review  with stating that  The only reviews  ever taken time  I write in  real life were  negative ones, choosing  completely ignore negativity.  This however will  not be my  last negative review , even sadder  would say that  after taking time  and write this , we've even  found our round  trip with British  Columbia to be  more direct I'm  typing this on  my final connector  flights to Barcelona.  on February 24th,  2016 I purchased  the round trip with cancellation flight  between Vancouver, Canada  for Barcelona, Spain.  That was a  gift for fiance  on her 30th  Birthday as well , our 1 st engagement anniversary.  So we counted  on the days  and excitement booking  in an apartment  and scheduling reservations  for dinner as  well as tickets  to a Barcelona  tennis match. Even  ended up scheduling  the grandparents on  our side for  my 9 month  baby daughter.  April 16th, 1  week before our  trip I receive  this email labeled  ""... travel itinerary.""  When I opened  this email, our  flight no longer  cancelled our flight  to Vancouver to  Madrid actually they  still had a  cancelled flight from  Miami on April  17 As I  finally got home  late on April  17 from Cuba,  I couldn't contact  us until early  morning of April 17th (my Fiance's ). Convinced it 's just a  coincidence we thought  little of it.  When calling in  late morning we 're informed that  the flight had  been ""cancelled"". We  tried everything we  can to make any flight happen  that day but  was told there  were only 1  flight remaining and  told my fiance  to fly out  of the 17th , I follow  up the 18th,  that as an  American couple makes  more sense. We  decided to look  into this and  try to seek  reimbursement for the  cancellation fees and  various things that  we were now  short of money  and due to  for a day ! This began  our huge run  in of my  husband trying to  submit their online  application 3 separate times only for  each screen to  keep ""submitting"" for  about 30-60 minutes  every time, never  mind actually submitting.  We decide again  we overlook this  but deal with  them at the  check in counter  of YVR. The  agent we were  referred to was  a very nice  lady who went  above and beyond  to figure out  what happened to  the flight the  previous day as  we left as originally scheduled without  checking on it.  She put a  notice on our  flight that an  agent from Jacksonville  Airlines had cancelled  their flights for  any apparent reason.  We asked for  the upgrade on  their seats, that  were available to . We asked  to access to  the BA lounge <mask> we waited, <mask> were told <mask> was full <mask> though we <mask> past an <mask> lounge on <mask> way to <mask> flight. After <mask> very uncomfortable <mask> to Heathrow <mask> spoke to <mask> agent there, who again was <mask> in pulling <mask> our file <mask> and sending <mask> email to <mask> the ball <mask> for us <mask> the reimbursement <mask> (which we <mask> have to <mask> for a <mask> before we <mask> go ahead <mask> to recoup <mask> of our <mask> which unfortunately <mask> wouldn't get <mask> the day <mask> missed back). <mask> went the <mask> step to <mask> us access <mask> the lounge <mask> waiting and <mask> our seats <mask> a few <mask> That was <mask> breath of <mask> air until <mask> realized that <mask> had been <mask> to the <mask> right behind <mask> curtains. While <mask> snacked on <mask> 1/4 of <mask> sandwich portion <mask> food we <mask> hear the <mask> dishes on <mask> other side <mask> the curtains <mask> good food <mask> were eating all the while staring at minimum <mask> empty seats. <mask> are now <mask> to make <mask> out of <mask> fact of <mask> we will <mask> get home."
4.0,"Doha to London  and Bahrain with  Gulf Airways, and  also very poor lounge in Doha. Even flying First Class on BA there is no reciprocal arrangement to access the excellent Qatar Airways Lounge. Instead there is  one lounge for all other airlines. On boarding my wife and I were ushered to our seats. And to our amazement our individual lockers were opened by  2 flight attendants who promptly disappeared without making an offer to hang our coats or jackets, as is standard practice on even business class. No hot towels  at take off or landing, very average menu, and as we slept through dinner were keen on breakfast. Told that due to possible turbulence coffee could not  been prepared, both our cutlery earlier wrapped by the  captain were delivered without spoons to eat the very  good muesli. Orange juice tropics a quality. We had  to ask for marmalade with our toast. All the crew displayed little perception of customer needs, made the more marked by Qatar Airways Business class crew who  were absolutely excellent on the earlier Sydney to Doha Flight. Poor food, very poor crew  communication or attention to detail, who seemed to be going through the motions. Slightly aloof.  Far below the 3 Gulf majors in flight attention.  Our bed was very good, as you would expect.  Economy kit below the Qatar Airways Business class kit,  is a joke in comparison to Qatars First class kit. Very agreeable cabin and seats, but crew performance at economy class performance. Would avoid again."
3.0,"London to Johannesburg, and I decided this time to fly with British Airways given they fly there with the A380. I was quite looking forward to the experience of flying Business Class on  the upper deck of the A380. I needn't have bothered. Following an uneventful few hours  at the Galleries Lounge it was time to board, straight onto the upper-deck. My business colleagues before me  walked through the gate without problem, however I was told to wait a moment as there was an issue with my boarding card - wait a moment sir, oh it looks like you've been approved for an upgrade to First which is on the lower  floor - no, sorry, my mistake  - you're still  in Business upstairs but I'm afraid we've had to move you from your selected seat"" (the one I'd  pay the not inconsiderable sum of £80 to reserve in advance by the way) -  and not to worry, it's still a window seat"". Except it wasn't - it was seat 50A, a windowless seat next to the toilets. The journey itself was uneventful. The food a bit of a disappointment without any flavour, my beef main was dry and rather tasteless. The wine was very good. Entertainment system 't bad, though not a patch on the likes of Emirates. The staff friendly and  pleasant enough and  even managed to  stay a few hours. I wrote to BA to  complain about my change of seat and the unprofessionalism of telling someone they had an upgrade when they  know I had to chase up twice for a  refund The one I eventually got was pitiful and as impersonal as could be with a stock answer about the need for them to  constantly change people’s seats for operational needs The biggest issue for me with BA’s Club World however is its ridiculous layout whereby people have  to step over each other’s legs - I don’t know of any other business class product which has this and it leaves BA well behind the competition.  While not my favourite airline, BA  could do worse  and take a note of their partners Iberia which has a staggered layout but offers direct aisle access to all. The situation whereby you find yourself starring at strangers until one of you decides to raise the privacy screen is also far from ideal and surely not safe as the cabin crew have to constantly lower it to pass hot food and drinks over your neighbour. Can’t help but think that BA have missed a real opportunity to shake things up  in their new fleet of A380s. Whilst some airlines have been creative and had on-board bars, lounges and showers, BA has just packed in as many seats as possible – <mask> are 7 <mask> in Club World upstairs and 8 Downstairs which is staggering and an insult when paying premium prices. <mask> should have known better having flown on one of BA’s other new additions to <mask> fleet last <mask> a Boeing 787 to Toronto, which also was <mask> claustrophobic. I returned home from South Africa upstairs on a Boeing 747 from Cape Town to London. The plane might have been older <mask> the experience altogether more pleasant. This journey ironically took me up to Silver Membership, I won't be choosing to fly long-haul with BA again however, unless I have to. There are far <mask> alternatives out there."
2.0,"I am writing to complain about my deeply distressing British Airways flight from London Heathrow  into Cape town with a change at Johannesburg. The flight was badly managed throughout. when I arrived at Heathrow, I was told by a member of staff , my name was not on the system. She  then found it, She then said 'oh Im sorry to tell you that there are no more seats on the flight.' I was obviously distressed by this as imagined I would have to return back to Dorset? However, after much insisting she  she eventually found my seat. I arrived at the gate in good time for my  flight to Johannesburg. However we were all waiting for about a further half an hour  from the time we were meant to have departed the airport. In this time, there were no explanations  as to why we were so late boarding the plane. Once on the plane, again we waited and waited and waited - and eventually we were told that 'Sorry for the inconvenience, but BA did not  have enough time to the the engineering works, or refuel or do the mandatory paper work for this plane during the day.' So we were extremely late in setting off from Heathrow. I think this is a poor excuse  for not departing at the correct time and we were not given enough notifications throughout the lengthy wait. I was concerned about catching my next flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town. The flight attendant told me  NOT to worry and there will be lots of  extra ground staff  that help us all when we arrive at Johannesburg. However, this could not have been further from the truth. Once landed there were no British Airways staff present - except for one lady in a High Vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to Johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to Run to the next gate for the flight. She then pointed at a  guy (he was  with no uniform) saying he will take me and another passenger to gate. We literally  ran through the airport and then the man asked for a tip? I gave him £5 but was extremely suprised that I would have to 'tip' someone who supposedly BA  told me to go withOnce getting to the gate and (just in time) the lady at Comair said radioed through and told us they had already sold our tickets, and rudely shouted at me as to 'Why? did you leave your luggage' By this point  she had tears falling and was feeling extremely overwhelmed. She then told us to 'just go back' with no further help. Luckily another passenger was with me and was kind enough to show me the BA check in desk to ask for new tickets to Cape Town. Once at the BA <mask> were not helpful in the slightest. They simply <mask> me to go and get my luggage from a 'Menzies' which was the other side of the airport and see if it was there. I ran too and fro the Menzies (lost luggage) to the Comair and BA office - back and forth for around 2 hours. No staff were helpful even though I was crying and feeling completely bewildered. "
1.0,"London to Los  America via Heathrow with British Airways.  We paid for emergency exit seats  on our flight  which was allocated  and at check  in 45 minutes later when trying  the board flight, we were stopped  then told we  were now at the back of  a plane with our tickets given  from BA staff,  who were sitting ! It transpires we have to  fight BA ourselves  to get our  money back after  waiting in a  queue This sums up British Airways now, as an  airline where customers  were effectively charged  with something they  were provided with  but then BA  takes it so  bad that they hope they get  to keep the  same customer service  almost non existent.  Worse than this,  the 4 flights  we took were  cancelled our son was given child  care we hadn't  given the choice  of meals was  out of only two options both  were disgusting, one  is the seats  actually broke on  the new A380  as the seats were incredibly uncomfortable  in that you  can feel the metal frame as there is no  padding in the  seats An internal  South America flight  I took had  less space and  more comfortable seating  on BA's A380.  I cannot find  anything positive to  write about them."
2.0,"Got a British  Airways flight to  arrive within cooling  time period, they  claim refund takes  72 hrs. Many  days later still  not refund. Promised  date 11 April  would get refund  after 72 hours.  Payment of 15  March BA can’t  say when will  get refunded. Payment  on 17 April  cancelled for replacement  on flight booked  on first flight  being cancelled and  want refund to  the balance. BA  no care, holding  claim and won’t  explain when it  would be refunded.  Loyal customer for  2 years. Appalling  BA service and  BA say if  payment due on  18 April not  made for replacement  then it will  get cancelled and  you will lose  your deposit despite  this fact they  are keeping £353  of my money  but have lied  to as to  WHEN it will  get refunded. BA  planes are now  absolute nightmare, last  few flights travelled  to were delayed  due to hand baggage only passengers  stood up and  down the aisle  trying to stuff  the hand luggage  and overhead lockers  and no care  nor consideration for  the passengers possessions.  We had to  stop unless people  sit down and  allowed hand baggage  to be placed  on hold, plane  will be further  damaged British Airways  trying to decide  if it wants  to be a  non frills airline  Or not, it 's now worse  then Ryanair or  Virgin Not a  great experience to  fly BA anymore.  Despite having problems  of one type  and another on  almost every booking  flight with BA  in the last  3 years, continued  too be loyal  towards them but  now do not  understand customer loyalty , their recorded  Customer services message  that they want  and maintain high  standards after travel , wish to  have a passenger  relationship with BA  and they fail  on all counts."
10.0,From Heathrow to New York JFK . This was  The first time  since a while  where I have been on a  flight Even although  I was old  and was in  good condition and . Both flights  left on time  and no problems . . The  seats were okay  and the food  was very good  and economy. The  flight attendants were  kind and helpful.  We were very pleased with the  experience
8.0,"London London Heathrow , Houston IAH. Avios ticket, and British Airways gold card holder. Having taken my food  order before others  on the outbound  flights I was  little bit surprised to find they  have given ""my"" risotto to another passenger. They were very apologetic however and allowed me  the choose something  from the First menu. Aside from  food the journeys  are uneventful, and the quality of  food was better  than the last  two times. Overall I'm quite happy  about this latest  booking experience."
8.0,"Flew London to Beijing with British  Airways The flight leaves from Heathrow  at 5, normally Beijing flight leaves from B Gates, so I made myself comfortable at the B Gate lounge which is 100 times better than the two A Gate congested lounges before the flight. It was a good flight and day flights are more comfortable, though quite full. The BA Club seats are configured  wider across and  my seat is not as wide as competitor's, but just enough. CX may have better seat but BA sometime offers good value. The service is good. It has a Chinese crew and unlike with Cathay, the crew are always the same on this route (because they are based  outside China specifically for the London route), so a frequent flyer may  be recognized and get treated better. It was an on time flight."
8.0,"It was my  third time flying  for British Airways  on this particular  aircraft from Vancouver  to Paris CDG  via London Heathrow.  Each trip was  completed on time  without delay. Online  sign in was  free and got  to pick out  which seats I  wanted Picked up  my boarding passes  at the airport  before any problems.  The food was  about average and  all cabin crew  were courteous and professional. Drinks were  well served or  could be picked  up from the  bar independently. Washrooms  kept clean. Overall  a satisfactory experience.  However one thing  which all travellers  on the YVR-LHR  series will notice : the age  in this aircraft.  I think it  should be replaced , since this  is a very  long route. I flew in late March and return  end of April,  in low season  so the cabin was still full.  We think this  airline deserves a  bigger aircraft like  Airbus A380. Particularly,  both back of  its seats are  very thin and  I can feel  the scratching movement  as the person  who tries to retrieve items from the front pocket.  the in-flight entertainment system is also  rather out dated,  graphics were not  good and colours  are rather misleading."
7.0,"London Heathrow to  London CDG with  British Airways. Nothing special for a short flight but was happy that  I was on ! It is  typical that for short haul flight BA uses seating that the business  seat are the same as Economy  so that the  economy seat is  not empty. And on this flight  this was not  available so I  had similar space  to my next  was unoccupied. Snack  was offered free, though not hot,  along with a drink. "
8.0,"I Kong to  fly with British Airways. I normally prefer aisle seats  on long haul  but this flight I chose a  premium seat, because  this was an  economy flight on the upper deck.  This upper deck situation means that I can take  use of a  special side drawer where apart from easy storage I  may also put  stuff on top.  My Premium Economy  is just enough  storage to move  around if needed. BA's Premium Economy service is good,  its food is  about the same for economy as  is the case  on some airlines, and the seat  feels comfortable. BA is generous on alcoholic drinks though  I do not take advantage of it. But the  service is not  very good. All  in all the  service was satisfactory."
10.0,"Imagine our amazement,  we went to  check our flight  tickets to London  after our holiday  to the West  End of the  UK and found  they were upgraded from Economy to  First World. It  was especially nice  to my fiancée who has only flown economy previously.  Customer service and  staff were very  good and the  comfortable seat made  her flight much  very pleasant. The  747 is a  great aircraft because  is is so quiet and looks  very smart inside."
8.0,"I decided to  treat myself to  British Airways premium  service from Beijing to London, which  were not much  too expensive than . I had  my bulkhead seat which meant I had plenty of legroom and could  stretch out on  my flight. The cabin looked a bit tired but  the staff were  polite and professional  and I was comfortable. The food  looked quite good but a glass  more champagne when we boarded would 've been nice.  My IFE was  fine but the screen was small  as it malfunctioned during part of  the flight."
9.0,"After our recent holiday to the USA, I was  so excited to  be flying on  a new A380  at the first time. After some  hours in the  Airbus Terminal 5  we went to board and found  seats were upgraded  from Premium Economy.  Our aircraft was smart and fresh  looking and we  were welcomed with  enthusiasm The A380 is by far the quietest aircraft  I have ever flown and the IFE was good with lots of  space The food was decent and  I had friendly , professional service on the plane and at Heathrow."
8.0,"From Heathrow to Athens on BA642 (2/4/16) and returned on BA643 (9/4/16). We decided to  make a break from the low  budget airlines and fly British Airways to Athens as we had found  relatively cheap flights  ($ per person per way) and  fast flying times.  As someone travelling with us is  flying blind we could reserve seats before others on  our flights with  a priority boarding  being given as  possible Online check in was smooth  and boarding passes  to the outbound were printed off. On our flight out to Athens  passengers were given  a choice of a hot or  hot meal. As I had something to eat before; I passed, but  it was great given that some  passengers would have been transiting quickly  and wouldn't have time to eat  before the terminal.  The night flight  on the way  home was also  great as meals (one hot option only) were offered with free drinks and pillows were  available Flight attendants were professional on  the flights. Both flights landed early  (+ 35mins early!). If there is  much I could ask BA to  improve on is  have one desk open at Athens  with all flights  for the day  or anyone that  lands early and just wants to  print off boarding  pass or offer  self service kiosks  in other airports outside of London.  In conclusion British  airlines are better  then easyjet or  Emirates and if there is only a little price , I would recommend travelling with ."
4.0,"Riyadh to Dusseldorf via Heathrow with British Airways. Check in at Riyadh was terrible, broken baggage belts and staff explaining to passangers that there is an issue  incapable of fixing it. Flight to LHR was smooth and with good  security LHR however was a disaster.  Border Security took forever and the gate agent was even worse. I have a trolley and handluggage as specified. First she started complaining about the trolley - surprise it was within size - then she looked  at my laptop  case which was 1 cm too large and made  her check in  the trolley -  most of all  was her attitude in this. I feel that her  product bashing behavior definitely did not comply with the BA image and expectations from businesses  or passengers.  I will search  my options before choosing BA again."
5.0,"Jet Airways used  too be better  at this. I  stayed all afternoon  in the Business lounge, waiting for  a Gatwick flight  around 7pm. My  seat card said  my gate closed  around 1840, and  as I hadn't  heard any announcement  before 1830 I  asked the BA man at reception  if there was a delay. I  felt very dismayed  when he casually  replied ""yes, about  an hour 30 ."" I was  so unhappy they  had not told  passengers earlier, or  ask if we  had help getting  on in a  very timely manner.  This was a  point when BA  would have tried  and reroute its  delayed passengers, but this man told  that his duty  officer had specifically  asked him not  not do this.  BA told me  even if I  wanted to switch  from an earlier  flight or LCY  then I would  want to go  to landside and  buy a ticket  to those flights.  There I had my first experience  of BA's new  Continental Europe, wherein  the middle seat  was covered by  a tray, to  give the perception  of more space,  but actually giving  passengers a wider  seat or more ! From my experiences of BA  Business class in  both long and  long haul, over  this past year,  this is very  plain to see  why BA is  intent on making  adjustments which make  them more money,  rather than changes  which benefit the  passengers experience. My meal was plonked  up in front  to me without  informing me what  food was, and  that wasn't at  all tasty. But a stewardess gave  a great customer  courtesy by giving  me a plastic  bag to decant  the bloody mary  in so that  I could hold  it to it  on approach to . That was  another very nice  service I hadn't  heard offered before  from any airline  I flown with."
6.0,"it is very  odd that British wings pre-allocated me  to middle seat, which I was  never allowed to  do when checking  out online unless  you paid 9 pounds. At the  gate self service  checked in would  never let me change seat either,  and I had  go find a  full service desk to get my  own window seat,  a waste of my time and  money The short flight from London  Airport to Amsterdam was ok, flight crew spoke to the cabin a  couple times, which I appreciate. But cabin crew clearly  thought they were  somewhere else. My  meal choice was water and crisps, hardly ""full service"" but at least  it was free."
2.0,"Welcome to Montreal  and London. What  we got from  Canadian Airways so far? 3 flights, 3 delays, for  total cumulated time  of 5 hour  and 15 minutes.  Out of a  4 hours and 35 minutes delay  from Montreal, they  let me miss  my connection in London. They booked me on another flight which made me wait a  full 4 hours  for London instead  of 2 hours.  Coming back to  Montreal from Marseille,  this flight is  just one more  and I am  now what you  might call a  happy customer."
7.0,"London to Larnaca. I find travelling with British Airways  very hit and miss at times. Having flown extensively  in the past few years in  both club and economy with them it seems a gamble on how the flight attendants moods are. On our flight to Larnaca the FA's had a terrific attitude , were courteous and the cabin service director was professional and polite. The older type seating is far more comfortable than the new slimline seating adopted  although still only just bearable after nearly 5 hrs of sitting. The 767,s still have an air of spaciousness compared to the A320 that  is used on this route. All in all a good flight but compared to some airlines that offer a lie flat  cabin with personal entertainment systems on medium haul routes BA is falling behind."
10.0,"From City to  Isles of Man  with British Airways.  Despite a not  surprising cancellation of our flight from Gatwick with Easyjet  ( seem to  be become more  or more unreliable),  we purchased tickets  on BA from London City. Despite  the weather problems  and with storm  clouds approaching, they  undertook the effort  and operate a  plane back to  The Isle of Man and got  you all home.  well done BA!"
5.0,"This flight from Copenhagen to London , was British Airways, but operated by Jet Time, who are operating some BA services on the LHR-CPH  routes this summer. The aircraft was definitely not up to BA standards - old, very  cold inside. Cabin service I cannot comment on as  honestly I had 3 seats together  but slept most of the flight. I really hope this is a temporary move on BA's part as this really is not the standard  passengers have come  to expect from them on this  flight"
8.0,"On to Rotterdam,  from Amsterdam to London. City Airport is undergoing renovation work, which gives the pier to the gates the feel of an abandoned warehouse. The  departure lounge is  now little more than a Portakabin. This trip felt a bit like catching a bus,  but is fine for business travel I guess. Onboard the outbound flight was less than  half full. BA's Embraer fleet are pretty new and clean. The E-170  is a fun little plane to travel in, with steep ascents out  at LCY and some tight turns.  Cabin crew excellent and a small snack (shortbread, popcorn or crisps) and drink were served on this 40-minute flight. Immigration and baggage reclaim at RTM is a breeze. On the return leg, onboard service was excellent.  Since it was  the evening flight the free bar service was much  better Arrivals at  London was a shambles, the flooded  toilets being particularly unpleasant. Shame they don't fly to Rotterdam from Heathrow though - T5 is far more pleasant than LCY."
9.0,"Paris to London  flight service means  you can have a buffet dinner  on the lounge rather than onboard  your plane to maximise rest time. Excellent flight, LHR  flight track system  allows for speedy  loading onto my flight to Berlin.  Edinburgh to Berlin a pleasant flight , excellent service.  One negative issue  being that British  and business class  ticket selection costs extra if done  in advance."
10.0,"Tel Aviv to  Liverpool Heathrow with British Airways. Fast , efficient check  in Plane left on time and  it was very nice and did  NOT give the impression of being rushed. Seat comfort  is Club World , which is  a nice surprise. Food selection and  service top notch. Absolutely no complaints."
6.0,"London Gatwick to  Rome Fiumicino. If  anyone has flown  from Airways Club  then you'll realise  in the same  thing as their economy class EuroTraveller  has a seat  folded into a  row in the middle. As I  recall flying from Gatwick, the BA  flight was under  way and was directed into No 1. lounge which was quite packed already. When I  returned to Rome,  the baggage was  full To make matters worse, the counter for lost baggage which operates  on behalf of  British Airways was very poorly marked.  There was no  name or logo of British Airways. It was manned  a two person  that hadn't had  a clue what  is going on and would only  assist in filling up the forms. To make matters worse, they were  speaking to each  person leaving my  luggage and I  sat awkwardly staring  for them to complete their conversation.  Bottom line is, whatever carries the  UK Airway brand name is good.  Any 3rd party organisation which BA  uses are questionable."
7.0,"Welcome to Dubai  and via Heathrow,  by British Airways.  One Outbound segment  includes an A380 , three others  a refurbished B747-400 s  As  the regular 20-year  customer and a  high level Executive  Club member, one  expects to expect  considerable variation in  what BA onboard . Staff are  not polite and  unfortunately some are , very well trained, so seem  they lack the  same attention to  service that should  come with Club +. The fish  on course served  at IAD and  BA was unbelievably bad, but other  options were fairly  good High Tea  and scones, clotted  wine and strawberry  jelly is an  excellent cost-cutting measure  from a British  Airways as I  focus on the  private sector. It 's sad to  think this airline  now working harder  a response to the competition."
3.0,"Miami to Manchester via London Heathrow with British Airways. The aircraft was very old and dated, and too hot with no  ventilation above the seat. Food was disgusting - some  kind of chicken mashed up with potato and peas. These 747 aircraft need to be updated or retired as they are now showing their  HD Tv screens  are so small and have no USB or power .. Outbound flight was with American Airlines that was so much better. New aircraft, good entertainment and food with was good. Now that you  need to change terminals at LHR when connecting from Miami, there is  no advange of flying BA. So if you can choose a different airline or if you have to fly BA, avoid  the 747. The A320 on the domestic flight to Manchester was very comfy and looked so much better."
2.0,"British Airways in my mind is fast approaching a national tragedy. As one who has flown them on/off for 35 years  I suggest I am qualified to have a view  down having travelled in all cabins including Concorde. We  fly Club Europe  at London Heathrow to Pisa and  did this last  year over the Easter break. We  had a home in Italy and fly the route often. Flight out started in the North Executive lounge  of LHR. It was not busy and was OK.  No choice of unhealthy bacon baps  or similar rolls stuffed with whatever. I had some fruit - tinned fruit. Plane was  the newish plane and the so called ""new"" Club . Three seats - with the  third one as a ""table"". Tables are usually in front of one - not to the side. Zero legroom unless you are in row ""1"". Last month I flew the regional Business Class  with Singapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. Needless to say - British Airways does  not come close when it comes  with seat comfort. Disgraceful. Food okay on both flights. FAs on both flights were also fine. The curtain  separating the Club cabin from Economy was broken, hence  we had queues  from the WC stretching into the Club cabin.Its long overdue - but BA need some serious management changes to build value into their key  routes"
4.0,"St Lucia to  Birmingham Gatwick in Premium Economy on  22 March, and I had the worst flight I have had for  a time on  Qatar Airways. No newspaper, inedible curry  and no wine,  not coffee. Breakfast  food was inedible and no coffee.  TV entertainment awful , old films , very small . Oxygen levels  very low with many passengers complaining  bout headaches etc.  Was not interested  as as usual , Airways employees  came into business  class and seemed to get a  great service! As  usual you say  will use them again on this  trip but very little choice as only competition is  flying and they  are not that good either. Compared  the airlines like  Air Qantas, Air  South Zealand etc,  they have much  more learn. Have used Thomsons to Barbados and Mauritius  in Premium Club section on the  new 787 and  this was a fantastic experience. Great  room service comfy seats and super in flight entertainment."
7.0,"Flight from Seville to Gatwick on British Airways A320  Business Economy. Flight  started a few minutes ahead of  schedule and landed early as well. Seating was face-lifted economy class, and  i think less comfortable than the older style we flew out on in an A319.  Water and a drink okay. I do think British Airways could come  through with a 2nd drink or water service on a 2.5 hour flight. Overall okay."
7.0,"Flew British Airways  to Oslo to  Newark Heathrow on  15 March.   People were happy and helpful, cabin  cleaned and looked . It wasn't a new plane but the seats were new. Served a turkey and cheese croissant. Will fly again with  them Was on time and landed early

"
7.0,"Flying to Seville with British Airways. Flight was delayed  due to French air traffic controllers being on strike. BA did their  part to help,  all boarded on time and were ready to leave if a slot became available, however we still got away nearly 2.5 hours late. They served drinks and  even invited passengers  can view the flightdeck during the  flight Once we took off flight was okay, typical service with sandwich and drink. Wine was passable. Better than most shorthaul economy service, seat was comfortable given the limited legroom."
8.0,"Flight to Seoul Incheon via London Heathrow, and overall , was very  pleased with my two flights on  board I'd checked  flights online and  the Drop at  JFK took less  than one minute.  A small snack was served, on  each flight to London, which was uneventful. The flight  from London to  Seoul was on  a new 787  and was almost  flawless A very friendly, professional crew,  which was of  a very high  standard and amazing sound. I was  surprised by the  length of both  meals (lunch and  then breakfast). The  first real let  up was the  plane It was  cramped (so narrow)  so I felt  very squashed in  by it. This  left the flight  slow and difficult  for sleep. This  little let down  but was a very good flight."
3.0,"London to London , with British Airways. The main  reason I pay  when travel Business  way is to get extra leg room. BA's Club Europe now gives  you exactly the same leg room as in Economy, which may be  fine for a quick hop to Paris, but is definitely unsatisfactory on  the near four  hour flight. It  is particularly annoying to see children sitting in row 1 - the  one row with reasonable leg room.  Service was fine  - the food  was good, but no entertainment at . From now , I'll book Economy and pay  in exit seats - it's a . Either that or fly Turkish  with an airline which is going from strength to strength.
"
8.0,At Heathrow to  London on British  Airways and very friendly and efficient . We chose Asian Vegetarian as  usual which turned  out to be . Hadn't flown  there long-haul for  almost 10 years and improvement was noticeable. Free beverages  were offered and there was a  food choice too.  Bag allowance was  very adequate. The  service at Terminal  1 at LHR  was very well.
1.0,"We have flown with British Airways over 100 times, usually in business class. On our current ski trip we paid a substantial premium to fly one way in First and home from London  to Denver in Business class. Yesterday our flight was cancelled due to snow. This of course is not  their fault. After  waiting nearly an  hours on hold  in their “Gold Card” premium service line we were  informed that all  their flights are  booked so they cannot help. We are “not authorised to help with this on the  basis you have  a drive to the airport and ask (“beg”) the airport staff to consider using a different carrier to help get you home” - for a long planned family Easter holiday. The true test of a company is not when things are going  wrong it is what they do when there is  the problem. BA.com  had been truly  negligent The email cancelling our flight did not even  include a phone number to call for rebooking."
7.0,"British Airways from  Dubai to Johannesburg  to London Heathrow.  This leg SEA  and LHR was  in a 747.  That plane was  nice to me. I don't understand  any comments from  people who think  a 747 is tired or worn . Not a bad ride in  particular when the  passenger in front  behind you doesn't recline their seat.  We sat in  front of the  seats (seat 52A)  of the tail.  the food on this leg was bland, the continental  air was a  disappointment I would  take seat 52A  again if I  was traveling on  a British Airways  plane but be  warned there is  no wall next to 52A that you can lean  on to sleep.  This leg was  aboard an A380.  I sat in the tail of the upper deck  of seat 82A.  Every time, the  poor woman in  back of me  went to the  left as soon  when she could  but kept her  head that way  an entire 11+ hours of the  trip The A380  was a very  small plane and  my overall experience  is pleasant despite  the turbulence the  rest of the  trip The upper  cabin on an  aircraft is amazingly quiet. The food  on this leg was far better  than an English  meal served prior  to landing in  Amsterdam I would  never play for  Seat 82A again , there are  cardboard boxes under  a seat in  back of 82A  which limit foot  travel but I  would play for seat 82B, which  has an aisle . IFE on  these legs was  really sad but I'm not one  of popular culture. Cabin attendants on  these legs were polite and did a very nice  check BA ground  crew at Heathrow  was very nice and helpful. I've  traveled between South  Africa and North  Africa about a  thousand times over  this past two years. Flights that  take you to  connect planes in  the Middle east  and Europe fly  through Africa and  they tend to be very bumpy  even at night when most convective  turbulence dies down.  The flights that  are routed over the Atlantic Ocean  tend to be  slightly smoother."
7.0,"Gu Dhabi to  Singapore Seating narrow , uncomfortable but seems to be  our norm with  new aircraft with  other airlines. Cabin  is excellent, but  when they move  passengers or British  Airlines employees from  Economy to Premium  Class or Business Class after boarding  is complete they  will do so  again without fare  and passengers noticing.  Fast food served  have declined in quality and quantity.  Original English breakfast  was to be one of the  worst meals in  service on BA. Now there is  not bacon in  the but rubbery  bread and the  boiled egg equally ! Truly awful meal. Flight on  time and entertainment system getting better.  at least the  seats on this  new aircraft are  nicer than those  on the ancient  ones still operated  by British Airways."
5.0,"Gatwick to Amsterdam in Business class  is truly the most uncomfortable flight of my life. I thought that with British Airways  you might expect something a little better - what a stupid mistake. The Business class  tickets are standard  business class, with  one seat empty.  Food for breakfast was okay although  good enough if you were hungry.  And luckily they provide champagne during the flight."
10.0,"Chicago to London  Excellent and terrific  customer service and  food The updated  home entertainment service is great with a very large selection of films  and TV shows. The menu was not extensive, but  was nicely presented.  All staff both  in the lounge  AND onboard the flight were great.  My transfer from T3 to T5  had a great  experience"
10.0,Transfer and return  in an A320 in British Airways  Continental Europe. I would recommended to have any seat in row 1 as this has  been most pitch of Club Europe ! Two short  flights of just over 45 minutes to a full  hour a drinks and meal service was provided with  professionalism. Efficient  landing and disembarkation with luggage first off the belt at both airports.
3.0,"PHL to LHR and return, both  in new cabin. British Airways has degraded its economy  experience to the  extent where US  airline companies may actually offer a better service. On the 777, BA  has removed the  restrooms in the  cabin to cram in more seats,  causing long queues  for the remaining restrooms. The new economy seating feels  extremely cramped, the  service on offer is of poor  quality and of  small portions, and avios accruals have been significantly reduced for low-cost fares - I just don't see any reason to continue to fly this airline. I find  absolutely ridiculous that  it charges insanely high prices to reserve seats in advance, making me have to stress out about checking  flights on time  or on vacation  and ensure that  we can snap up whatever good  deal is left by that time. My next trip to Europe has been booked with  BA - I  am able to choose a regular  airline for free at the time of booking, and  it will accrue the full amount  in miles that  it am actually . Although BA staff were courteous  and competent on this trip, that  does not make up for the current sad state  of the economy : "
6.0,"Domestic British Airways , Heathrow to Edinburgh return this  being my 2nd  trip on this  service over the  next 4 weeks.  Takes a little  slower if booked  at short notice  this is a  good service. Check  in bag drop  and fast track  to T5 very quick. I used the Galleries South  Terminal Boarding via gate 23, the flight departed around  15 minutes late  but arrived around  10 minutes late which was fine.  Lunch and coffee  served during the  entire 10 min flight. Return check  is a bit  late but once  checking in used  the galleries lounge for a quick coffee. Boarding at  terminal 5 on  nearly a full  service with business  priority which was  quickly departed on time for a  journey of just  under an hour,  bag tagged priority  took off quick.  Very much prefer  Boeing 767 on this route as  alternative to the  777"
3.0,"Philadelphia to London Heathrow and return, both in new cabin. British Airways  has degraded its economy product to  this point where US airline companies  might actually offer a better service. On the 777, BA has removed  two toilets in the rear to  bring in more  passengers causing long queues for the remaining restrooms. The new economy seating feels incredibly camped, the food on  offer is of  poor quality and of increasingly smaller portions, and avios accruals have been significantly reduced for low-cost fares - I just don't  see any reason to continue to fly this airline. I also find it ridiculous that BA charges insanely high prices to reserve seats in advance, making me have to stress out about checking in on time  and on vacation  and ensure that  we can snap up whatever good seat is left  by that time. My next trip to Europe has  now booked with American, and I 'm already seeing  the difference -  BA was able to choose a regular seat for  me at the time of booking, and I will  fly the full  number of miles that I am  actually flying. Although all BA staff were incredibly courteous and competent on this trip, that does not make up for the  current sad state  in the economy ! Bye bye BA."
1.0,"Flying to London Heathrow with British Airways in Premium  class and abysmal  early boarding. No  quick take off . Ran out of wine bottle , and also ran out of  drink choices. Seat  was truly dreadful. I had to climb over the armrest to get . The person  watching played games , stabbing at  my screen for  2 hours. Complaints  they don't care and I am  still waiting for my miles to  become credited."
9.0,"Travelled British Airways from London to Nairobi return and excellent flight both ways - outbound crew were not  quite as good as the inbound crew but I wouldn't complain about. I think the Premium economy seats were a new  design or at  best the covering,  and find it 's more comfortable , the leather  was almost up  with the comfort  in Virgin's A340 seats when they used to go to Nairobi. Had one problem with entertainment equipment on the return flight, it was locked  on on the announcement screen, despite no announcements being made, but there  are empty seats we could have  had Is premium economy worth the money, in my case I say yes, 22 stone, on a 6ft 2in, 73 year old frame does not like journeys much over 3 hours in standard economy. Check in  is ends good - as is  common at Nairobi , multiple security  checkpoints but its a known fact that different people notice different things,  so I see  that checks are a good thing."
7.0,"British Airways, Athens - London Heathrow  to Los Angeles and return. Shorthaul : it seems the drink service  happens less often  than usual compared  with previous BA flights. The new  economy seats feel more spacious, but in my opinion it has less  comfort compared to  my old ones. Food quite good, pilots great as always. Longhaul - Upperdeck A380. Food  in courses quite decent but the snacks inbetween and  on the galley absolutely terrible. Seats feel very cramped on the A380 in economy class. Also unacceptable to charge so much to choose seats.  BA always seems  they have a delayed departure (plane  too big for  its own good?) Entertainment fairly good.  Will be interesting , compare with the competition, as plan on trying another airline next ."
9.0,"At British Airways Club Europe from  London Heathrow to Prague, as always, the staff are  extremely professional. You can see that  they enjoy what they do. The flight was fast and easy, no . The crew made sure I felt comfortable and I had all that I needed on this short flight."
10.0,"Turin to Gatwick. The plane was  good time and  my lunch was one of the best I have  experienced on short  flights I had  some very similar  lunch on a flight on BA from Geneva to Heathrow, which also landed early with  no bags waiting when I left  the control. Why can't all flights  work like this?"
1.0,"Welcome to London ! I spent  some considerable amount  more time in Jan and Feb, booking these seats, and I had to pay over £70 for the privilege. BA systems  were not working  - and I had to get phone help - to find the  seats but at  a 15th attempt, I managed to  get the seats.  I like a window seat, mid cabin, in a  section that divides by 3. Our flight was called, I went to  our gate, with people behind me.  The bar code  for the bag 's issued boarding pass wouldnt scan. He asked his  mate who had other boarding passes, that still wouldnt ? His other colleague thought it might be my passport and went off to check. I made the point that I had been in the airport three  times so if there was something  wrong surely they could have contacted me? The colleague  went back. The bar codes still wouldnt scan and I heard one of them say 'they are already through'. I said I had booked a window seat for hubby and hoped the new one was. He said they were but by their numbers I could see they werent. Got on board.  That was someone already in those seats!! I found an attendant, who went off and  gave us two seats. No window, across the aisle from the loo. So all night we heard the loo flushing and got bumped by people waiting and falling about due to turbulence. That would be why they were free.  I did look to where my booked seats . There was a family of five in that  row that obviously wanted to be together. So though I was in  some different bit of the cabin that might have been premium economy,  so I was offered a hot flannel and some warm fizzy win in a plastic glass, I was certainly not upgraded. Doesn't matter if you pay for seat reservations, 6  weeks in advance. If somebody comes along later they'll turf you into cattle class. And to think I stopped using Ryanair!"
10.0,"Flew British Airways  to Helsinki -  Mumbai Heathrow -  Travel on A320  & B777W including  direct transit from  Finland to T5  to Heathrow. The A320 felt quite  comfortable in Economy  but the energetic and motivated cabin  staff made the  experience enjoyable. Later  on were very  happy to have the bigger and newer Boeing 777W  to the Mumbai sector, where the  first few rows  were empty seats and we were able to stretch  our legs properly,  which was a  real bonus. The  service was good  with the 2  complimentary meals served quite tasty and filling. In addition,  the cabin crew  were again excellent.  On the way  the flight was  better than 2.5hrs late out of BOM which would 've meant a missed connection at  a late Saturday  for the last  one out to HEL that night. Asked the BOM station manager to  get put on  Jet Airways since  they seemed to be on time,  only to wait  until the very last minute due to a fully  booked flight, but  instead got two seats on Jet to catch the connecting flight at  least the same  time The very  positive experience with BA on HEL-LHR-BOM  as well as  the rerouting that was carried out  by an exemplary  manner make us  appreciate British Airways. Very good experience  provided by experienced  & cooperative BA  personnel at all . Will fly !"
5.0,"We flew British  Airways from Gatwick  to Punta Cana in economy and flew back in  the economy. Was  this worth it? Well we didn't pay too much  money so probably  say yes -  how about. But other than slightly  more legroom you  dont get much! Same food as  usual as far  what I could tell. Main meal  was nice. Breakfast was not good  especially for an airline of this  high calibre -  a cold cheese croissant and muesli ! Only one tea/coffee round and  all they whipped round to collect  their empties. We  had to board  as the economy passengers but that's  a big deal. We had to pay extra to  take seats at  each side in  our pair. Otherwise,  we would have had to sit in a block  for 4 in  one middle which  we don't like.  We begrudged paying  that extra for  us to be  honest Captain was  friendly and informative,  and apologised endlessly for the short  time leaving Punta Cana. Crew were  friendly but not . Ours was an older guy  that had an  expression of 'I've  tried doing this a long time  and I'm pretty fed up with .' Whilst I  do understand this,  and if you  act like that  is your job,  we need to move on. The  plane only landed  hours late and having made up  so lot of  time en route would have been  in time had it not been for air traffic  controllers at Gatwick  which I can 't believe. Same  old awful out of date IFE.  Crew despite being  late were very  friendly"
1.0,"London Heathrow to Moscow. I have been flying to  Moscow with British  Airlines for a  couple years now, today I flew to Moscow and  my long haul  the Boeing 747 / Boeing 767 have now been  replaced by the A321 which is  almost as enjoyable,  however the seats  were very uncomfortable.  what disappointed me  as most was  the meal which was served, it  is a four  hours flight from  Manchester to Moscow  and all they  served was a  Breakfast Sandwich and  a Kit Kat!  I would have  hoped that on a flight of this length there would be a hot meal. The majority of the flight attendants were also very good at not making  face contact either  that was disappointing too. As a  British frequent flyer,  one would expect  the much higher  standard of service, it is a  shame there there  were not other  planes flying direct  into Moscow as  we would be using these in the future."
7.0,"Flight to Zurich with British Airways. Check-in at T5  began with problems:  The check-in machines did not recognize my credit card and not my frequent flyer card. But very friendly staff at premium  flight helped and  checked me in without fuss. Boarding process rather messy, boarding staff gave different and contradicting instructions and organized  the chaos. Most  economy class passengers could board the aircraft first. Crew  very efficient and  quite friendly with rather typical BA  cabin staff is  laughing away when  chatting and having fun amongst themselves.  Being a client one feels bad to interrupt their conversation with a request."
8.0,"The process in  Singapore easy and  quick The flight  was on time  with friendly and  helpful crew. Food  for breakfast was  tasty although not enough if you 're hungry. Seat  cleaned although was not impressed to find used refreshing towel of previous  flight in seat . Arrival at T5: business as  usual or even  easier - arrived  at T5-B, take a train to  Newark and walk  and walk until  your exit terminal."
1.0,British Airways has completely terrible customer service. I paid extra to fly  there instead of  any of the  major airlines assuming some sort of quality of experience. The flight is more than 2 hours delayed with no reasoning and they refuse to book customers on another flight that has room on  standby and is departing earlier 'because it is closed' and willing to make the customer miss their connecting flight instead of finding a solution to a problem. People are extremely  busy don't provide any information to customers and don't provide any sort of solution to make the experience any better. Avoid this airline at all costs if possible unless you have a lot of free time and patience.
4.0,"Miami to London : with British  Airways and not  so happy with  my experience. The  plane is an impressive jet, but  without paying the extra for Premium Economy the seats are like torture. It is impossible  not get comfortable so sleep is  really just elusive  but impossible. Didn't  find that the  Premium Economy experience  was of any great value. Staff  friendly and food reasonable."
2.0,"My first long  distance flight with  British Airways for  15 years and what a mistake! I flew Premium  economy expecting it to be on  level with its competitors especially Lufthansa or Virgin Atlantic - not so  much all. At  this airport, it  was over 1 hour to check-in;  it was no dedicated premium economy check in nor a premium economy  baggage queue at the gate either; perhaps the plane would be a little special? No, not at all, it was an  expensive Boeing 777  and had been designed to maximise seats at the expense of comfort;  The cramped space of the premium economy cabin with its 2-4-2 seating was comparable to economy and was light years behind the modern and  comfort of other  aircraft and sitting in a middle row seat meant you could not  easily squeeze past  a person next to you to the aisle unless you woke the  others up or  I took your  chance to stand  between them and hope you manoeuvred successfully. Stupidly I had thought that competition would eliminate most differences between . How wrong  I was - avoid British Airways on the Hong Kong route if you are flying on a Boeing ! My advise  was to check  the plane type before booking or  I will suffer an expensive 13  hour flight reminiscent  of over 20  years ago!"
10.0,"Traveled British Airways from Heathrow to Edinburgh return. Airport staff and cabin crew were polite and professional at  most airports. The return flight on 3 March was delayed due to  a technical issue. While waiting at  the gate the  crew approached the  staff explained the  reason for the delay and apologized, which was much appreciated. It was a good experience and I recommend BA."
3.0,"Getting to London  ( via Singapore,  on our first foray into British  Airlines Business Class  ( World) was  never a success.  My bed was  made up of  the hinged flap and it was  through this flap  on the inside  person had to  move In my  case he was a large passenger  that had heavy  boots which had  no heels. I  was sure he  needed to be  because his leading  metal edge hit my exposed ankle  so hard. The  food was atrocious , the breakfast  buffet was grey  and inedible. As  breakfast was served , it proved  difficult to request a second cup  of tea or  water The early  lunch hours snack  menu composed of  small sandwiches with  water or no . The staff tried hard and  always had water  offered to me  if I asked  about it. But I had to find someone to  collect used toilet ry paper towels  to mop up  our lavatory floor.  As expected in Business Class. Uncomfortable flight and never  to be repeated by us."
9.0,"Flew Edinburgh to San Francisco via Heathrow on British Airways, A380 Premium  economy and the experience was very good. Short connecting  flight from Edinburgh which due to  flying domestic you  were treated as  Economy Class so  having lounge access / priority boarding  between domestic legs  which was nice. A380 Premium Economy  (# 62k at the window) was excellent. Seat very comfortable, loads of space and great storage with bins at the side.  Nice warm towels and bubbles before . Inflight entertainment  was good, food good and well  served Food and  drinks kept coming on the outbound flight. Return (night) flight a different experience. Same seats but staff were hardly seen due  too a lot  of people sleeping, but there were  still lot of  passengers asking for drinks / snacks  etc and the  service just seemed to lack a bit. No bubbles on the way back. Overall a  good experience, very  happy with BA  and the A380  Premium Economy highly  rated and well  earned the extra."
5.0,"Gatwick to Punta Cana with British  Virgin Flight was announced as being 30 minutes late so we waited in the departure lounge. It said a gate would be announced but the given time came and went with no announcement. So it was soon evident that we would not be just 30 minutes late. Eventually,  everyone boarded. It 's a full flight so no space for spreading .. Crew were fairly efficient but not that friendly and one lady didn't seem to enjoy her job. She was in such a rush to get the dinner and drinks served so she could rest, she kept barking questions at passengers asking  if they would like to drink etc. All unnecessarily stressful.  Seat  very uncomfortable. IFE about 10 years out of date. I don't expect a route like  Puerto Cana is top of British  airlines list for  having improved interiors  or IFE. Food however was delicious. No gin is a big let down though. Seemingly no vodka either.  "
8.0,"British Airways flight from London to  Singapore on January 30th was perfect, a superb crew, helpful and chatty without being obtrusive. Cabin was comfortable, amenities, pyjamas etc of good quality. Food was rather dull, and not well prepared, perhaps 5-spice duck is not the best for an airline cabin. Wines and  drinks were of good quality, and  luggage arrived on time and in good shape. De-planing was efficient, and as expected in Singapore Changi, everything functioned well. The return flight  on March 3rd was not so good. The crew were sleepy and not particularly communicative; you had to  wait for everything, even the meal schedule, and it took ages for dirty crockery to be cleared up. The flight arrived early, which was good, but as usual, Terminal 5 was still asleep, inefficient and ineffectual. We did not use the usual immigration channel, but it looked chaotic, as was the baggage re-claim nowadays.
"
1.0,"Gatwick to Marrakech. The British Airways lounge at the airport has been  empty for some time and therefore they are sharing  a paid for No 1 lounge.  Very overcrowded, me  & my family couldn't get in to use it. The check in  desk apologised about  it so they clearly know the problem. BA should inform the customer  prior to booking that they are not able to  provide the full  flight British Airways  customer services response  is to inform  customers of their  travel plans, not  so helpful. I  will not recommend  the business class short haul out of Gatwick. Save your money and  go with someone  else"
8.0,"British Airways from  Dubai to Rio  De Janeiro. Friendly  Cabin crew (ground ed a little  less clean modern ) Good announcements  of delay, and  an attentive service  during the flight.  I pre booked  buffet meal which  mean it comes far earlier than  usual wine and  cheese and without  too few additions,  like as cheese , crackers -  some staff returned  it with missing items. Not sure  to pay for  Economy Economy as  is not a  great deal of  choice other than  drinks and food.  Good selection of  drinks Cabin crew , and attentive  to juice and  water for the  plane A good  choice of tea  from a kit  was available. "
2.0,"Flight from Heathrow  in Chicago  delayed over three  weeks with a  series of excuses for Boeing 747-400  poor tech, faulty smoke alarm in  BA catering truck , fuselage door, engineers couldn't correct fault. BA would not let us off the flight. Captain came to  Second Class and  answered questions, which was a nice  nice touch. When we finally got  home food and  dinner service were  also mediocre. BA First Class seat is a very,  VERY poor product,  BA entertainment screen slow. IAD-LHR return  with the A380  is First Class. The A380 is a wonderful aircraft,  sadly let down by the poor  of First Class  seating and service,  Club seats are  only Business Class by modern standards, and the dinner service was inelegant and almost inedible. Crew on return  seemed impersonal, and keen to get  the dinner service ! Finally, BA Customer Relations (based in India) responded to the 3+ hours delay by declining my claim with an insincere form letter. They also don't appear to have a good grasp of English. Overall, the end-to-end experience with BA was poor, and evidently they don't care. It is far, far, short of a First Class experience.  That is what you get with a quasi-monopoly to  the USA from London. The only merit was the  new A380. Let us hope BA  upgrades their aged Boeing 747-400 with this aircraft, but  in doing so,  ignore the terrible  seat configuration of First and Club !"
9.0,"One feature of British Airways these days, is that its product can be so variable.  From this basis,  i had low  ratings of a recent flight from  London to Athens.  My plane was an old 767  and being phased out. However the crew were professional and attentive, food was good, plenty of drink available  in the inflight  entertainment comprised the  newest Star Wars movie. Given the  extremely low price  they paid for the ticket -  few complaints. My  complaint is the accountants that run  that airline and always chipping away  on the soft product."
8.0,"Welcome to Accra  via London Heathrow.  Despite a chaotic  flight the flight  home was smooth  and comfortable seats which felt softer  on the newer  seats narrower. Food  tasted good, the  rest of cabin  staff positive and professional and the movie selection good. I was however surprised by the  different Audio selection than experienced on  earlier flights, especially concerning rhytmical music. 1.5 hour before landing a second serving took place.  This was a  pleasant experience flying  back and I do not hesitate in recommending this airline. Only concern  is the limited space for hand luggage - BA  has more strictly  ensure the hand  baggage of the passengers is within the limits given - way too  many passsengers ignored this on this  flight the return ."
8.0,"Flew British Airways from London Heathrow  via Munich. Generally excellent both ways except the poor seat space. Flights  first time, nice new / refurbished plane, cabin crew worked hard throughout. Food actually quite decent - nice breakfast out and tea on the way back. Sadly the seat space same as economy, when the guy  out front reclined I couldn't even open the paper, just about ok  for 90 minutes. So worth paying  that little more for against economy  if not too  much"
4.0,"Stockholm to London Heathrow was not  a pleasant experience. British Airways has  a good way  for reminding you  that you're flying  business class. The interior was tired and worn, and  the seat was . The legroom was inadequate for a short-haul flight.  The cabin service was variable, while some were courteous,  many practically barked  at you. One steward even tapped  down and gestured  you for a  seat  On the bright side, there seems to be a lot of generosity with alcohol. I have  had the fortune  by sitting in  line of three  equally loud and  very intoxicated ladies  and pressed for  the stewardess for more alcohol every  five minutes on  the flight -  who promptly obliged.  Maybe I should  of taken the advantage of this  generosity to make  my flight more bearable."
3.0,"Welcome to Helsinki  - Check in  at T3 quick  security was fast  with security. I  found the BA  flight in T3  which is nice  being used by  other Oneworld airlines,  apart from being  limited there was  only limited food  in offer at  all Boarding was  easy and done  via bus to  a remote stand,  then the seated  seat 1A with  flat fee seat  available to me.  I was looking  forward to something  nice to eat  thanks to the  lack of food  options in the  terminal - unfortunately  any food offered was pretty basic  I say the  worst The crew  were friendly which  I guess was  good Arriving in  flight on time  to another remote  stand and bus  my bags where  loaded quickly despite  having priority tagging. Check in for  the return was  with security a  little slow but  halfway through I  went for the  boarding lounge which  is packed with  empty seating. I  tried to find  my seat in  the computer booth  with a coffee  and check my  bags Boarding was  fast with no  service and once  more a 10  minutes bus ride  to a packed  terminal to then  sit in the  bitter cold and  wet for a  full 10 minutes  ride via steps.  Then a delayed  plane departure service  arrived with a  breakfast followed by  some very basic  breakfast of 3  small sandwiches and  1 scone. Crew  were okay and  kept passengers updated  on the delayed  service Finally arrived  2 hr late  but with the  exception of an  extra Bags off  service which was  great Otherwise a  first class on  this 3hr flight , no in bound power, economy  only with middle  class blocked. Standard  Class offered in  class on other  airlines There is  economy class in  the European business  airlines anymore. Added  in the poor  service of the  new frequent flier , it's a no brainer for  me "
7.0,"Sent from EDI-LHR-PHL-LHR-EDI  to World Traveller. Outbound shuttle to  JFK was a  BA 767-300 in  premium economy layout,  free to bag  a 1F/1G using  baggage checkin. Cheery, friendly crew -  only problem is  with excessive hand baggage allowance permitted  by BA. Selfish  crew take huge  photos on board,  holding up the  space so everyone  carrying more modestly  valued items can't  take a look . Cabin crew  was stressed trying to move cases around lockers to get everyone sat ! LHR-PHL upgraded  - the rearmost group of two  rows on Row  3 on   a 777-200. BA  has now cheekily  increasing the cost  of these to  four each -  meant to be  around £33 like  in rest of  my cabin. Wisecracking captain over the  flight made the  flights a little  less entertaining -  had great crew, I could eat  the meal for once. Only thing  which went wrong  - the IFE  in my seat  was in the  last 90 minutes  into the flight  so I could  only view the  seat tracker. On  a side note,  do wish BA  could upgrade the  seats choice, they haven't changed it  from the last . Flight was  long time no ! Inbound PHL-LHR I reserved a  seat for £33 , but note  you cannot buy  any back row on the middle  aisle - reserved  with the crew.  We encountered severe  congestion between Nantucket  & Newfoundland, crew  had to rush the drinks and the meal service  as a result. . No apologies  to the pilots  about this which  BA usually does.  Similar problems about  excessive hand baggage exacerbated on the smaller A320.   It was the  cabin steward by  lucky coincidence that  booked us on  our outbound shuttle  one week earlier  than he did  meet us, and  ask us how  our holiday in  Newfoundland went! Otherwise flight was pleasant  and did what  was said on the tin. Overall  it was a  fantastic value trip . I booked  BA through BA  Direct and it being off-season meant  the total cost  of £940 (before  seat upgrades) including  two days car . One observation  though it that  everyone is now  apparent that BA cares little about its economy passengers  who now seem  to exist to  fill up the  cost - everything  really seems to  get geared around  attracting high-spending Executive  Economy members. Avios earning has been  sharply cut in  our World Traveller  business class, so  the discounted fare  now only attracts  two Avios in  a mile. Therefore  this transatlantic flight  on the East Coast of the  UK (which used  the get 3250 <mask> now only <mask> a measily <mask> Pretty pathetic <mask> I really only use British <mask> via LHR <mask> USA trips <mask> on the <mask> of using large widebody planes <mask> American and <mask> who increasingly use Boeing 757s) <mask> and their <mask> deals which <mask> hard to <mask> and enable <mask> instalments."
9.0,"The British Airways  flight from Venice to Gatwick, seemed to be a brand new A320 with leather seats. Friendly staff and  the quick sandwich  and a drink. My gripe is that too many people bring cases  onto board, leaving little room for people who've paid for hold luggage,  can stow their backpacks etc. Same as on EasyJet."
9.0,"Private Business Class  from Heathrow to Chennai. Check in  very painless and  taken to the  number 5 lounge  area was very  small but well  stocked with refreshments / food. Boarding  was painless and  was greeted with  ease The pods  both faced forwards and rearwards, so  sit carefully if  your like a  particular orientation. Seat  was comfortable. Perhaps  not being especially  tall or wide  but there was  lots of wriggle  room for me.  Film selection for  me was fine  - am not  into regular cinema . TV screen  seemed adequate although  my old eyes  well done with  it slightly wider.  Lots of drinks  / snacks outside meal time. Dinner  very good -  I had a  bowl of a  small starter and  the main. Breakfast  is ok -  eggs were solid  - but everything  was great. The  surroundings were pleasant."
8.0,"Decided to upgrade and treat myself to BA's Club World. Check in at JFK was efficient. Fast track through to security was a breeze. BA's Galleries Lounge at JFK T7 was shared with Cathay Pacific and LOT Polish Airline. The lounge was spacious and clean. I was encouraged to have my dinner in the lounge as the service is a sleeper service. To my disappointmwnt, there wasn't enough food left although the selections were good but not the best. After my pre-flight dining, I decided to have a shower. The shower rooms were clean and amenities available on request.  The Club World seat is around 20 inches wide which was very comfortable for the quick 5 hour flight back home.  One was greeted by my name by the cabin crew who were friendly. IFE option  was the same as flying economy clasd.  Menu was handed out a along with Elemis amenity kit.  The meals were good but portions could be better. Upon arrival in LHR, bags were delivered on time. I was told  I pay a visit to their arrivals lounge but I didn't bother. Overall, I would fly with BA's Club World product again. Seat and bed was very comfortable and well maintained despite the ageing aircraft. Cabin crew friendly and enthusiastic. Just one thing that BA might want to consider is the food portions because their portions are baby sized portions."
7.0,"Flew with BA in economy class  of their third oldest Boeing 777-300ER.  Transportation was delayed due to the  delayed arrival of . The aircraft is showing its age but the interior is clean. Flying on this B773ER was with  the new economy  Class seat pitch  of 31 inches  that is bearable  on the 8  hour flight. Meal service was delayed due to turbulence. Choices were cheese and omelette or  chicken grill, I went for the latter which was good although portions could be better. Second meal service was just a sandwich and a sweet. Staff professional and interactive with passengers. IFE with  a handful of  major Hollywood films.  Food choices could  get better. Tip:  Choose A and  C seats due  to the IFE  area restricting your legroom. "
5.0,"BA Airways domestic  flights only from  London Heathrow to  London and basically  your only option  on this and  similar routes, check  out at T5  as my Frequent  Fly status is  likely to be  cancelled however I still have it  in a few  extra weeks, so  bypass the fast  track security and  used the BA 's north lounge.  Board at A5  and on to  the full flight  and on time,  then board service  again for a  longer flight. Drinks , a snack  and arrival almost  at time. Return ed flight with  my bag drop  delayed a bit , otherwise used  the BA lounge  after boarding a  Boeing 767, departed  full time and  had early service , with a  coffee served with  breakfast although the  staff missed me  completely and appeared  confused when I  first asked for  another coffee. It's  a okay service  can be expensive  if booked at  little notice but  gets you from  B to B WI"
4.0,"I flew back from JFK to LHR and not  my greatest flight  had ever been on. The seats were uncomfortable, poor  cargo room for long haul ( electrical box under  seat infront) unedible food. Poor selection of onboard entertainment. The only good thing about my  experience was the staff! My outbound flight was booked  through BA but operated by American Airlines - so much better!"
8.0,"Flew British Airways  via Zurich to London Heathrow to  Paris International and  then Outward flight from LHR to Accra fully booked,  my B747 cabin  looks a bit shabby, seats are worn and tight. The crew however  made up for it with a  great attitude, food was pretty good  for economy class.  Flight back was  postponed by over 24 hours due  a a busted  luggage brake. Communication  at the airport  would be better but BA offered  accommodation and meals during the waiting . After the problem was solved the flight was  made the next  day and was  good I even  had to lie  down and sleep a few hours  but the cabin  had only half ! What really  amazed me was  when the BA  Passenger Service managed  the request of . After a  number of days  BA contacted me and transferred the  requested amount. I  therefore really must commend BA for  this straightforward service."
9.0,"On to London  from Helsinki. The  cabin readiness, and  attitude of the cabin crew reminded  of why I 've appreciated BA in the past  and continue to  do so: they  know what they  promise they will do, and do  them well. BA  makes me happy  and pay the  little extra for  a bag and  one small meal,  and I get  treated like a  passenger - and  have an exit  window seat as  the tall person,  since there was one and I am 6'6"".

1.0,"London Heathrow to  Southampton Full load, flight 30 mins , economy pax carry on lugagage  sitting in club cabin overhead bins and upsetting a  member of club  cabin Purser did  not care. No flight tracking system on this new looking aircraft. Seating in club cabin is more like Easyjet nowadays. Very cramped. No reason  will fly British Airways club in the future and  I have lost my business until  flight configuration and service improve."
3.0,"Bucharest to London Heathrow and the worst thing above all are the  British Airways business class seats and  the shocking lack of legroom. Cramped into a space  it is less than many economy seats. And this was Club Europe! Poor breakfast - one slice of bacon, half tomato a few tinned mushrooms and an omelette so overcooked it was grey inside. Seat itself  was comfortable and staff were good. Toilet waste bin had tape around it and so  the sack was used for rubbish instead! Not a good flight overall."
7.0,"Washington to Heathrow with British Airways and I have to say that the IAD ground crew and inflight crew are fantastic. I sprained my neck just 2  hours before departure and was given the option to pre board, which made all the difference. The flight itself was amazing - the A380 is just like a rock in the sky, I didn't feel a thing. The seat comfort on the upper deck in coach is more than adequate - in fact it reminds me of economy plus on United. The premium economy is more like domestic business class on most  other carriers (older style business class not the new business first). The major downside - as I write this in the middle of my trip - is the ground staff at Heathrow. They are hard to  spot if they even exist. I'm in the middle of a terminal to terminal connection, still wearing my brace - and when asking about gate assignments and better options for seating, the best I got was a brusque ""sorry  is all there is."" When you see someone limping away from your  seat - at least ask if they'd like some assistance getting to the departure lounge.  I know that with United, they may not offer club access for free, but you can at least buy it and I have found their ground staff at Heathrow far superior to the UK's flagship carrier - unfortunately."
2.0,"First time my partner and I have flown British Airways for some years and we will not be returning after our flight from London Heathrow to Cape lla I booked the flights several months before and had to pay £40 to pre-select our seats both ways (£160). On both outward and inward flights my entertainment system was  not working. Attempts by staff to  fix the system failed so I had to cope with two 12-hour flights with no  assistance On the flight out my table was broken. When I raised this with the crew, I was told that a  fellow passenger must have ""bounced a child on it."" Dinner was very good but breakfast was appalling. There was only congealed  toast and bacon. When asked if  we could have  the Continental equivalent, all I got  were a stodgy choc chip muffin and some fruit juice. The plane looked generally tired.  I had to share one inflight magazine between us. The pillows and blankets were a very uninviting brown colour. My partner's entertainment system did work but she  did have to get a stewardess to use a spoon to release the handset from its position in her seat. I certainly wouldn't pay BA's rate for Premium Economy again."
3.0,"British Airways from  Amsterdam to Rio  de Janeiro via  JFK Weren't invited  into the lounge  at MAN due  to a rather  late check in agent. The Concord ian at LHR has seen better  days - ordered a bacon sandwich  that arrived far too promptly and  looked limp and  rather pathetic, so  worth it! Champagne on boardng was warm as was the water. Nuts  were pleasant. Seat area was genuinely  nice and had  even been thoroughly cleaned with remnants  from the toiletries  scattered between the  rows from the  paying passengers. First  line of food  was available, which  is unacceptable in  First Then a  third row of  seats just stopped  moving so my seat was in  a permanent 20 degree incline. Staff  attempted to get them working but  to no avail.  Seat ended being  bumped up, partner  in row 4,  me on row  7 Nice start  for our honeymoon,  thanks BA. Cheese  selection on the menu had changed and was offered  the scrappy piece of paper to  mark new selections.  Staff upgrades are  common on BA , First and  Business cabin had  in my reckoning,  4 paying passengers  and I'd say  about 4 staff  crew (all of whom appeared after  we had been pushed back from  the gate). These  sorts of crew are showered with  gifts throughout the  flight Personally I'd 've preferred to see some of  these full fare business class passengers  along with staff  and thankful for a seat, but  people seem to  think it's acceptable for staff to  be in First.  Unless you're on flying on business  and hoping for an upgrade, I'd  say you're chances  seem pretty remote,  but of course  you know one  from the crew  of that flight! A pretty poor  day all round , proves that  the once 'worlds  largest airline' has become so complacent  now they can't even get it  done in First . Is it  no wonder the  Far East carriers  were showing the  Rest of the  industry how to  fix it!"
1.0,"Glad I have the option to  call them a zero. Their customer service is abysmal.  - Was flying home from Amsterdam with my family. Booked on premium economy, which was around $700 pp  higher than economy.  Last night before  my early morning flight I received a text saying flight was cancelled.  Went to the  gate No BA employees were there. Could not get  them on the phone. Woman from another airline booked us on Delta in regular economy. Have spent since  then trying to get a refund of the $700  pp extra I paid for premium economy. Finally got the refund. Was  800 pp with no explanation. Customer  service people are  very sorry but they can't help me. There is no higher level  will take this . I had to go on  their separate form  and request the breakdown to see  if they calculated the refund. I expect more out of British Airways,  or I will never fly them ."
8.0,"Flying British Airways  from Los Angeles  to Amsterdam via  Newark Heathrow r/t  the Club World.  Personally prefer the  Emirates over the  European which was  expensive We used  both Qantas FC  One in LAX  & Galleries First  at Heathrow. Both  worked great. Service  and board all flights top notch  customer friendly. Food  & drinks good,  especially if the  service was a  bit on the  well done side.  Interesting that you  have pre-select meals  out of LHR. Wish you could  try this out  of LAX as . My complaint  about Club Europe . I know  they block out  my middle seat,  but at 6'2""  my legroom is  good All in  All great value  on the money.  Just picked up  two trips on  board during their  Economy Class sale  one year. Next  stop FCO, and  then DUB."
9.0,"Our first time flying to Dominican Republic and found the best deal with British Airways and the benefit was it is  the direct flight from Gatwick to Punta Cana. On the outbound flight, the plane was half empty, so it was nice and spacious. The BA Boeing 777 is an outdated plane which has  being used in  its fleet for many years and has not had a refurb I  would say in about 10+ years - I suppose this is why the flight was  so cheap. The staff on board were friendly and  accommodating The seat pitch is large so I could  sit for 9+ hours comfortably, the seats despite the plane being old, were comfortable and not showing signs of wear. The entertainment system is what shows the age of the plane, one of the smallest screens in the industry. They are very small, and the anti-glare screen is  hard to see from you need to keep adjusting  the brightness of the screen throughout the movie. The range of movies was good. Food was ok nothing special and not really a choice."
3.0,Back to Cancun return. My first  experience using British Airways and it  would be my  favourite My main issues were the dreadful cabin crew. The were rude  and poorly turned  out  I was unimpressed in the standard of the cabin it  looked dingy and tired looking. 
2.0,"It got off  on a good  start with a  nice dinner in  a Malaysian Airlines  Economy Class lounge.  It was looking  up to my  next flight on  this Boeing 787 -  so  - so, I  was from Singapore  on LHR to  Singapore when I  boarded the 787-9 A on this . The new  version is very  loud indeed -  The so called  aircraft - New  York is not.  The trumpet they  never listened to  before and this  latest version was  going be the  new pace setter.  - The FAs  on the route  were great and  food was adequate.  My chicken satays  followed by prawn  with mango salad  is fine. The  wine was also  excellent The cheap  and nowhere near  to Krug as  offered by other  airlines in 1st . The usual  boring stainless steel  seats and boring  plastic and chinaware  which we have  now get used . The seat  are definitely more  comfortable than the  747 and A380  First Class; its  wider and smaller.  With bed mode  - it is  like sleeping on  a park bench.  Very hard. The  curved ""island"" design  and the table  with retractable dinning  table is worse  on the 777  or A380. When  lying on your  stomach it digs  under your back.  This seat's narrow  opening becomes very  uncomfortable You have  a be a  passenger to get  in and out  to the ""compartment"".  I am 6 ft tall and  quite overweight. I  do not sleep  much at all  as compared with  the A380 flight  I took to  London last month.  The TV screen  is larger and  bigger - which  does not lend  well to a  nice dinning with  me as on  the other aircraft.  Not on a  slight angle as  if slightly facing  away from the  cabin The AV  camera is small  but overly complicated.  This is no  window There is  more window blinds  like on the  other aircraft. The  window can be  set to ""black""  or so you  get two black  faces staring at  you through the  windows BA seem  disappointed when it  gets to a  low end 1st . I will  miss this plane  the future. A  penny dropping disappointment."
9.0,"My wife and  I flew British Airways London Heathrow to Athens in  our Boing 767.  This flight was  about half full. We had paid extra for exit row seats, which  is ideal. There are no seat back screens and the ones on the cabin roof  refuse to work, this was not  the problem, not a great lover of overhead screens showing stuff you  normally would not  watch if given the choice. Left and arrived on  time"
1.0,"From Heathrow to  Manchester with British  Airways Outbound flight  was delayed by  two hours. Email was received on the day of travel. It did take 2 calls  to the airline  and establish if one could arrive . On the first call, there  was such a  poor understanding of  my question that  the operator thought  they wanted to  cancel flights. Fortunately  we were cut , as I think the call might have continued  through the rest  to the day.  Second call was  more successful and  the direct answer  was given, no  mater how unwelcome.  Printing your own  bag labels was  a new experience  for LHR (I 'm not a frequent air traveller).  A sign of the times perhaps , I did  get the impression  of going through  a self checkout  of a supermarket. Not much to say about bag  check off. It  is neither efficient  and inefficient, just  another linear series  with a few  tasks performed by  people doing their  jobs The young  lady at drop  in said that  their delay started as 10 minutes  at the beginning  of the week which had turned  into two hours  on Friday. At  departure gate, I did wonder why those with priority  seats moved to  a different seating  rows - all  within 3 metres . I suspect  I need to be seen receiving value for higher  ticket prices, because  others will of  never get there ! The flight was just about . My video  recorder did not work and despite requests to 2  ground crew this was not rectified  - well I  just ignored. Fortunate, as the film  or TV choice  is poor.   We do not  eat airline food that much. There  are plenty of food outlets past security to get something decent to eat. Never really  tried the wine. Beer and spirits  easier to get  on Return flight  was only made  easier by the  noise stream reducing  the flight time by an hour.  So the flight was just about  - Did not  enjoy the food  but I had  ordered salad from  the outlet at  gate - good ! Flight attendant  thought it looked  nicer than what  we were serving.  The seat in  front of me  is broken so it reclined further  then it should. The only solution  suggested by another  attendant was to  straight up walk  forward a bit,  to stand at  my back. Whilst the broken seat was not the  fault of the  woman in front, she did not want to be . The attendant  stood there waiting  for me to derive a solution. </s>"
2.0,"Seattle to Tel Aviv via London  with British Airways. The food was  about average and the cabin staff service was average.  Our seats are  clean and are OK as long as you do  not have a  situation where someone  has to step  behind you or you have to  stand over someone else. The inflight  audio system uses  the dual prong  built in for  the inflight entertainment , so I  needed to use  Bluetooth headphones which  are not comfortable  for long periods  over time. After  waiting outside of airport security for  a long layover at LHR and coming back through the security process,  we tried to  put my wife  bag in her  laptop bag which  we has used  during our travels  with many airlines  around the world  no question -  but was already  full on our first leg from Seattle. Her bag fit in BA's  standard gage frame,  and the BA desk agent did  nothing like how I put it in. Apparently it  appeared to not  quite fit, but it can only be placed in  its gage with  the straight up  / down motion ! After complaining  that her requirement  is unnecessary, the  ticket agent relented in a huff. BA also required  to I pay  to chose my  flight after buying  my 7000 USD  first class ticket. I am a  Delta MVP Gold  Member so I  could fly BA  on a partner  airline and get  a credit, but I cannot book  it without paying.  Having to pay , my seat , and the  poor luggage screening in LHR makes  it unlikely that  she will fly BA again."
6.0,"Gatwick is not  our first choice but for Naples with British Airways it is the only choice so we reluctantly booked a return Club  Europa ticket for a treat. Check  in fast and friendly, and fast track was amazing, we were the only people using it. The BA lounges at Gatwick have been closed  so we were sent to the No 1 lounge which BA is  using instead. To say it is less good is an understatement. £8 for a glass of champagne (whereas free in the old BA lounge) is just ridiculous. The atmosphere is more Weatherspoons than Fortnum and Mason and the crowd  are noisy and chaotic. If what we were told  were true (the  lounge will be  open until next ), we will be avoiding it  next time and  only avoiding BA  for that case. Food was small portions and service bordering on rude from the barman who explained very impolitely that they do not serve diet drinks. Once on board the crew were welcoming and friendly and  their afternoon tea adequate but not exactly filling (disappointing after the rubbish  that were served in the lounge).  Our flight from Naples began with another abysmal lounge experience. Windowless, crowded and with very limited food and drink, again not worth the bother. Crew again were wonderful and very chatty and friendly. New layout A320 and we had booked 1 A and C. Totally unacceptable seats. No  seats so right up by the main boarding door.  No carpet, just a rubber floor and during boarding I was constantly bashed by peoples bags and during the flight my feet were trodden on by people  heading for the toilet. Nowhere to stow my single bag because everyone else had two  bags more and had used all the space, had to stow mine  2 rows behind delaying my disembarkation. Dinner was nice. Baggage last off  my belt despite being priority tagged.  If it not been for the crew on both flights I would have thought the  money was wasted  on Club Europe. Lounges rubbish, possibly  The worst two lounges I have been in Catering on board -  not bad and  treated nicely Crew - The only reason I would  recommend these two flights Baggage service - Disappointing. Seats-  Yes Like the empty middle seat but front row was awful."
8.0,"An enjoyable short flight with British Airways from Heathrow to Dublin, the  flight was initially  extended by an hour due to a baggage error, however this did not affect me nor the quality  of the flight, the cabin was  very nice, seats  were nice with good leg room. Service from crew was satisfactory but could have been better, they could  of smiled a  bit more and gave a friendlier  greeting like other  airlines such as easyJet. The food was basic for a short 45  minute flight, wasn't  really anything exciting . I had a packet of  wheat salt crisps which were nice and some orange juice. The staff  seemed happy to  serve me. Overall , enjoyed the flight and will  try flying with British Airways again soon"
1.0,"Heathrow to Toronto with British Airways. Fast check-in and security. Galleries Lounge very crowded, poor  food offering and the furniture and toilets were not very clean. Boarding started on time for a 1705 departure but was suddenly stopped when it was announced that there was a technical problem and a new departure time of  1800 was given. This was later amended to 2100 and later to 1500 the next day : no details of the technical problem were provided. It is extraordinary that BA do not have  any better resilience plan for these incidents when they  are at their home base -  and a lengthy delay is unacceptable. Hotels/meals etc were organised fairly efficiently but not once was any offer made to re-accommodate on other flights until I made  the fuss (due to commitments the next day) and was reluctantly booked on Air Canada  by 0900 the next morning ;  they had empty seats in both J and Y . Several e-mails to BA Customer Service about this have yielded the usual stereotypical and  negative responses - they have ensured  us I will never travel with BA again, we do have a choice."
3.0,"Toronto to Heathrow,  our last flight  for British Airways.  Immigration and security  check and quick  service lounge was  great and the  food provided for  my dinner was tasty and perfectly adequate. Departure about  20 minutes late  but this time  it made up  for a 5hr  45 min trip.  Overall comfort and  convenience pretty much  the norm for British Airways Business  flights : no  seating around the  cabin and the  LCD screen did  NOT work as  expected Breakfast has  improved slightly ;  the fruit was  crisp and edible,  eggs warm but  a bacon and  cheese muffin was  quite cold. Arrival  was fine."
6.0,"British Airways outbound flight from London  DC to Marrakech  was comfortable. Being  the Silver member  I was able to choose the  seat in advance  (+ overwing) which  provides adequate leg  time for this short flight (3.5 %). Meals are  usually just confined  to sandwiches, all , plus tea  and coffee, plus one other drink  or snacks. There was plenty of room for luggage  inside the overhead . Return flight  was a bit  crowded on boarding,  and our priority tagged luggage did  NOT receive priority !"
1.0,"We travelled from  Amsterdam to Lisbon with a connection  to London on  May 9th 2016. Our flight was  cancelled - which does happen - however we had a to run  & catch our  next flight resulting in our luggage  still following us - upon arrival  at Lisbon no luggage. We were  given our luggage  by the local  baggage handlers who contacted British Airways  and be on  the next flight  3 hours later , we were given the option of waiting or  having it delivered to our place  o residence. We had no option  but wait since  my keys to  the residence were  inside the luggage.  After hours we came to claim  my luggage and  unfortunately 2 pieces out of 3 showed up. Again  passing through the  local baggage handlers  have now informed  me that our remaining luggage would  only be shipped  till next morning,  4 hours later , again they  gave us the  options of delivering  the luggage unfortunately our keys were . We had no choice but stay in a  flat in Lisbon  to wait. I was disappointed but  unfortunately things don't go as planned ? We contacted  UK Airways upon  our return to  advise them of the experience. The response was less than friendly this is why my review. They replied saying they are  solely responsible for  the luggage. Really? When I purchase my tickets I got an email  saying make sure that luggage specification  matches luggage allowed by the airline  in question. My understanding with our ticket purchase in  regards of luggage  is more than  10 Kgs per  flight and 1 Carry on. Where did I go wrong."
8.0,"Welcome to Geneva.  An efficient check in, the plane was a newish, clean and comfortable  flight (better than BA's old 737s), pleasant crew, OK food for the time of day, good value and it arrived on time. The odd  problem is that BA does not currently have its own lounges at Gatwick but uses third party lounges which are not as good. This is dependent on BA switching terminals but nobody had a timescale for  this This needs sorting out!"
9.0,"Great first time  flying First class  with any airline. Joined the flight  without a connection  and didn't do  the check in , boarded without  reservation Met at  my door by  cabin purser, greeted  by name and  shown to my seat. Masses of space, very comfortable  yet private, given  it is semi-open. Not a huge amount of storage  on the seat  - my case  goes into my  small locker at the front of  the seat. My  partner and I  sat in 4E/4F  at the back  half the cabin,  front of the  flight deck). No  help from the  cabin Choose a  different seat if  travelling alone. Being  another day flight,  I didn't have  seats made up.  The cabin is  comfortable yet contemporary , elegant. Pre-departure  menu included Grand  Cru Champagne. We  then chose the  dinner menu option.  Chef didn't like  my lobster starter  but staff substituted  the course from  the a la  cart menu. Food  tasted outstanding and  every pairing worked . To be  that bit fussy, the steak was  good to the  extent of being  the IFE was  good although no  TV to watch . The screen  is attached to  one side of  the seat and  needs to be  adjusted for take off and landing  when in Club  America which is very irritating. First  on the plane,  although that doesn't  matter much as  landing at MIA  is always a  mistake I've flown  with for many  years in other cabins and cost  difference is evident , Their Club  Class is a joke compared to  their long haul competitor but First  is still a  class leader. I  was very pleased  to fly BA  and relieved that  they still have it when it comes to cosseting in first class.  We paid for  this flight as part of a  long itinerary but took the train  to London to  Frankfurt to start  the Club Europe  flight there to  Amsterdam and then  business class back  from Paris on  United Airlines. This  is significantly cheaper  then flying directly  from Heathrow. Still not cheap but  totally worth it , looking forward  to the next . My recommendation  remains for First  Class - the  BA cabins are average at best,  but I will  not be flying  it regularly."
7.0,"British Airways business  flights from Edinburgh  - Las Vegas return via Heathrow.  All crew on  all flights were very helpful and  attentive Part of  the business class cabin on the  plane is located  in the upper cabin with 20 seats and two  cabin crew. The  cabin configuration however is just odd. The window seat  facing backwards and  the street faces forwards. There is  one privacy screen, but if you are not travelling  with a friend  and family member you'll be looking  for a complete  privacy for the duration of your  journey The cabin crew have to stretch over the person in the aisle seat to  order drinks and meals. If you have a window  seat you have  little option either but to climb over the person in the row behind you if they have their seat in flatbed  seat On arrival  in Las Vegas after an hour  of so wait at the carousel with at least a hundred people including myself didn't get their luggage.  Instead we all  continued to wait  on line whilst  friendly British Airways staff dealt with  a very tired and annoyed group of people. A $200 gesture was  offered but this didn't really compensate for the inconvenience. Return flight with  free check in and great service ."
3.0,"From Heathrow to  Manchester and I  am sorry for  Qatar Airways. I 've just flown  2 of my  worst ever flights with them as  they have fallen  into the depths  into being second  class against far  better competition. The  meals at T5  airport should be  fine but we arrived last night at 6pm to  get almost all  the food offer  gone so it's  that or a  hot potato and  chips then! So  far nicer to  save £20 and  buy a decent meal from one  if the many  stalls in T5 ? Then onto  a plane which  got tired. As  if bits of  seats 4 of  our seats were . My wife's ! My sound  system worked in  my left ear.  And really dirty  seats (and no  smell at all).  And late food ... But to  being fair, and  as a change,  my stewardesses weren't their usual BA  rude style but  were good and  very polite. But this is business  travel and it  certainly doesnt feel  of it any  more I try  to support British  Airlines but Emirates  is cheaper and  better "
8.0,"Milan Linate to  London Heathrow on  Monday the 6th.  I arrived at  terminal 5 20  minutes early. Polite  and smiling cabin ! As meal  time being late  and we received  a sandwich and  white bread with  salad with complimentary  water The aircraft  was in very good condition with  a new leather  interior and the  interior lighting that  was left on  is blue light ; same for  all washrooms with  the nice touch given to floor  by a parquet.  Our experience with  a ground staff  on Linate, left  nothing to be  desired as the  team members seemed  very annoyed with  the job and  were so helpful;  when we checked  the bags, they  could give us  a further information about where are  at the security  checks nor about  which gate to  go  T5 , very friendly  & helpful. T5  was very clean but a bit  too crowded. Fast  and efficient baggage  transfer"
8.0,"My British Airways  flew from Barcelona  at Heathrow on  22 January, seated  in 28F right  near the back.  Everyone was chockers.  I were delayed  taking off by  one hour due  of problems with  the Air Traffic  Controller testing a  different computer system.  BA had onward  service to Hong  Kong which was  pretty tight, told  the crew, they  boarded promptly, and  I was met  outside Heathrow with  this luminescent envelope  that gave me  entry through security , just made  the connection). Onboard  BA crew were  friendly and attentive,  my snack was  probably some sort  a chicken roll  and a very  light coffee and  fruit cake. I  think it was  the last flight  for the day,  but it had that lovely end of term feel  to it, everyone  was relaxed despite  the delay. I  know people are  little bit hard  at BA, they're  no flash but  with short hops  and they get  the job done.

"
8.0,"Really good service  on a packed  Qatar Airways flight  from London to  Manchester Crew were  good Food a  beverage were well matched. The business class seat is  bigger now, but  you still find  it very comfortable.  Film selection was  another treat with  the good number  of independent movies.  will definitely fly  here again."
9.0,"An excellent flight from Atlanta to London, with good food and drink,  tons of space  from a helpful cabin crew. Plane was delayed by bad weather in London but the  crew tried to  change things around. The IFE system was one of  the Airways newer versions which was very good, and it's a shame it is not available across the British Airways fleet."
8.0,"Doha to London Heathrow via Bahrain. As a loyal British Airways customer for 20 years, I have noticed  many variations in the type of flight attendant service and meal/beverage service provided on longhaul . BA's longhaul Club World   class is showing its age compared to the competition, but I like the seat cushion. Having to jump  over someone's feet  to access a window seat is not ideal. AVOD quality varies depending  upon the type and age of the aircraft, and storage space for  food items also varies. Service onboard  looked good from BAH to LHR,  but meal service was good, despite cost-cutting at BA being evident in  previous years. The washrooms were reasonable, but not up to the standard of competitors. The flight was on time, and my bags transferred at  last to my next flight to  Dubai USA."
2.0,"I received a  text at 3am  that inform me  of my British  Airways flight from  London to LCY  will be delayed  for 1 hour.  Married with a 5yr old, and  still staying at the Zurich Airport . I decided  the arrive at  BA check in  2 hrs before  the new departure !! Unfortunately, the  BA staff at  my check in , informed me  that the flight  Was Closed and  needed more check . I knew  it was incorrect, and asked for  Flight Supervisor, who  said that the flight, being at  a 1 hour late departure (2.5hrs ), it turned ), is not closed! We were  checked in of  a BA -  please train your check in staff  or fire the  incompetent ones. Luckily,  being a very  experienced flyer, I  am not going  to accept the  advice of the  BA check in  that suggested we  could fly in the evening?"
4.0,"London to São Paulo Guarulhos. British Airways Boeing 747's looks very old,  outdated and in need of an  urgent update. I heve flown 8  times in the past 2 month , in their Boeing 747s and all of them  are in the same condition. I  sincerely hope that the maintenance in  the vital systems are better than inside the aircraft,  which one can see in the  above pictures taken from my seat in the upper deck in my last flight. Also the entertainment system  is very limited."
8.0,"Following several bad  encounters with British  airlines over the  previous year I  took them for  a short hop  from Ukraine to  the UK. On  arriving at KBP  i wasn't offered  priority access (Silver  & FF). I  was a good  checked baggage only  check  The  crew onboard was  slow but friendly.  My meal was  available on this  flight which was  from Kiev, tasty  and the price  well paid. Arrived  at LHR early  so we arrived  at a terminal  early and weren't  taken to the  airport as is  normally the case."
3.0,"Welcome to Heathrow,  for the first  and last time I will fly  with British Airways.  Their aircraft from  a stand looks  new but soon  before we boarded you could tell  immediately the aircraft was at least 30 years old  and it was  very dated on  the inside. My  trip home was  horrendous - yes  this does happen to every airline, but they allowed  me to board  a plane and there was an  apparent fault, the professionalism of BA  staff was appalling.  ®"
10.0,UK Airways flight  from Glasgow to  Birmingham Heathrow under  route code IB7519.  Handling was prompt and a very  enthusiastic welcome from  our crew. The  plane left on  schedule and arrived  safely at T5.  Every seat was  full and the  breakfast served was breakfast which was  quite good. Several  courses of coffee  & tea served.  Another good flight.
8.0,"We took four  flights with British  Columbia last month - Johannesburg via  London Heathrow to  New York JFK  and return. On  arrival the service  seemed excellent. At  these three airports  it all went ! With BA the unknown is  the age of  the plane that  you get. The  cabin was excellent,  very clean and  comfortable space - I was on the upper deck;  a B777 also good with reasonable  seats and good , the B747  - so -  I had been  good and the  plane - the final leg -  Newark to JFK  looked old -  still reasonably comfortable  and the entertainment  very aged -  almost the size  of a large  postage stamp -  a poor picture. Really does depend how much the  flight means to you I guess.  I also tried the special menus  of LHR - business quality food  for which you  paid a small premium. Well presented,  delicious and a  nice treat."
5.0,"Thanks to a  flight change from  0000 to 00.05,  this brought forward  the departure by  almost 24 hours,  which very nearly  missed our flight  schedule from Rio , Janeiro to London. The check-in  counters were crowded  out by Team  Emirates athletes returning  home from a  swimming session and  so were relieved  we get the  full track treatment.  Our first/business lounge  in GIG is  typical of the  worst we've been . Our seats  in 1E/F and  only marginally better  that the first  floor seats on  any 747, although  still far off  the standard of  Qatar Airways competitors.  We also suffer  from being near  the galley and  there was one  team member who  spend much of  her night talking  away to her . 1A and  it seemed to  being occupied by  airline employees and  there was far  too much schmoozing  going on. Service  for the whole  is reasonably good, although none of  our food on  our menu was  actually available. This  happened rather feebly  evident on the  journey from one  lounge to the  next The IFE  operated reliably and  our large screen  has a much  better resolution than  the 747s. Overnight  the temperature in  the cabin was  far too high,  which resulted in  very uncomfortable sleep  under the duvet  that the pyjamas provided. The toilets  in the 777  are ridiculously small  but weren't well  stocked during the  flight Breakfast was  a usual affair,  including an atrociously  bland omelette. Overall,  the flight was  good but not  really first class !"
1.0,"Welcome to Calgary  by British Airways.  Do not let  us use avios a to upgrade  even though I  did plenty. They only allocate 10%  to cabin occupancy  for this - shockingly poor. You don't expect your national airline to scupper your honeymoon ? Although there was plenty of  frustration in the  cabin the fact that only 10%  were allocated (and  some seats can  get empty) they  should let you ! We paid  the tickets regardless in the cabin below, but still  not allowed to  ( I would have used another  ticket if I  booked in advance  and will do  the future)."
8.0,"London to Singapore  by British Airways, and the plane  arrived 90 minutes late due to technical fault with one of their aging 747-400 that found itself minus two wheels stuck  on the runway.  Economy class was full. One would think BA would put themselves out on this route given the competition from Singapore Airlines. Wrong - the champagne was lukewarm  ( is often the case). The amuse bouche taster was ghastly. Some sort of couscous and tasteless. Appetiser of sushi style salmon was very nice. Soup nice but lukewarm. Salad was forgotten by the miserable female FA. Mains of sea bass was very good. My wife had the same - but the beef main. She was very complimentary of the meal. White wine was luke warm. Solution - the miserable FA came back with a paper cup of ice cubes and dumped the lot in my glass. Brilliant. Wash bag of freebies was cheap and tacky. The seat - well I am very critical of this design. So much space is wasted with the ""island"" console in the middle. The designer of this seat should find another career. Seats already starting to show wear and tear. Why British Airways opted for a canvas material rather than leather is a mystery. In summary, the A380 is fabulous. Slept for about 5 hours. Great flight. FAs mostly  were fine. Terrific landing by a very skilled pilot. All in all ; it was okay - but not overwhelming as First Class should be."
7.0,The British Airways outbound flight from  London to Hong Kong was on a 3 year old A380. We sat near the back on the upper deck and  were very pleased with how comfortable and smooth it was. On the upper deck there is a cupboard by the window seat which gives more space to put your coats and also doubles up as a shelf to put your drinks. The 5 year old  Boeing 777 on  its return leg was far more cramped. Also the video screen was faulty and it was difficult to  concentrate on the screen. The crew on all flights  were fine but nothing special. Just performed their job but never really seemed to go out of their way.
10.0,A slightly stressed  our flight from Oslo delayed nearly  2 hours due  an engine problem. Crew were caring and assured us that bags were  above board. Food  arrived and wine . CSD informed  passengers that a  snow storm was on the way  that we might  become stuck in  Oslo as their flight the next night had already  be cancelled. Newark was deserted and  we were there in 5 minutes. Overall superb flight with British Airways  connecting London to  Newark 
7.0,"Mexico City to New York JFK : This is a totally different . There is no conventional lounge,  rather there is  no 'pop up'  with copious champagne  but little food.  Take and take off lasts all  about 10 minutes so no time for more champagne.  A crew then  play around with  you before the  next stop in . In the  evening you clear  the customs here,  in the evening it is just a bore. The  seats are wide  and fully flat  so very little  difference between each  of a pair.  Service is on  seats which are  that bit limited in choice and  so no moving  seats The food was not even  half BA standard  which was lukewarm.  For 3 crew  and only 38  and service was  excellent All in  All difficult to  get over standard  BA service unless  there is a  very good price , getting to  the City is ."
1.0,"I was originally booked on a United Airlines flight from London to Boston, connecting through Washington Dulles, but this was cancelled because of the snow in DC. United rebooked me onto British Airways to complete the  trip to Boston. Without a doubt, BA is one  if the worst airlines I have flown on. Upon arriving at check in, I was told that I could only check in one bag, despite being allowed to take two bags on United. United said that I would be able to travel on an equivalent service with BA. The check in supervisor at Heathrow informed me that I would have to pay £65 to bring the bag. When I complained said ""it's not my problem"". I asked if they could call United to clarify  my bag issue, but they refused, saying ""we don't  really talk to United"" - in the end I didn't pay and will get it sent at a later date. The onboard service was very disappointing. The  food was barely . The staff were loud and abrupt, providing the bare minimum service  whilst yelling across  every cabin at each other making the whole journey even more unpleasant. The inflight entertainment failed multiple times, and passengers started to be reseated because of the problem. The maximum volume was also too low so it was difficult to hear the movies over the cabin noise, and  I am not hard of hearing. It was disappointing that there was no onboard WiFi or personal device entertainment. British Airways seriously threw away an opportunity to convince me to fly with them in the future."
2.0,"London to Dar-es-salaam  from London /  London Yet another dreadful experience with  British Airways! Why do I travel with them? This  morning BA advised me that my  original itinerary was  changed because of a cancellation by  their codeshare partner Qatar Airways to  the Dar-es-Salaam leg of the journey, which would give  me a 24 hour layover in  Cairo before connecting  me to London. In itself, that  is not an issue, but BA  tried everything possible to wash their  feet of any responsibilities for their obligations under EC Regulation No 261/2004  - required by  Regulation 14.2 -  something they even post on their  Website It took  another day of calls by my  booking agent, and  many hours of  discussion with an  airline his supervisor, and the office  in Manchester before  I agreed that it was their  problem Their solution : a rerouting  for my journey  to Nairobi with  the extra flight by a non-code hare partner that cost them more  than the cost  of overnight hotel  at Doha - something they refused to consider. Go figure! Never again with British Airways."
3.0,"Although been impressed with British Airways in the past, today we had a very different experience on our  flight from Edinburgh  to London Gatwick. We checked in online and arrived to drop off our bags 45  minute before the  scheduled time and  where met by an extremely moody  checking in lady. She radioed another member of staff  to ask if we were to be allowed to come on the flight in an extremely moody manner,  only to have us not admitted (even though 45 minutes is the amount of time to arrive before from their website).  Luckily we were  admitted and with  the last scowl from the staff left the desk. We got through security rushing as we thought we must be really  late only to  find the plane  stop for an  eternity"
7.0,"Outbound British Airways  service from London  to Rio de Janeiro demonstrated the difference a decent  hotel can make to a flight.  All staff in Club World were  all male and  white and delivered  generally excellent service.  British Airways seating  capacity in Club World is looking increasingly outdated, but a less than half full cabin meant that one  felt less bothered  about one's neighbours.  Pricing was reasonable,  although it was surprising how quickly  our options ran out. IFE had  another good selection  of films, but  the resolution of the screens is poor. No queues  in border control and priority baggage handling meant that we were in our taxi within  15 minutes of leaving the plane."
1.0,"Gatwick to Male, and just when we thought the British Airways business class offer could get no worse, we checked in to find that  all BA lounge was shut and  our alternative was the number 1 Traveller lounge where for both first and business class,  tickets has to be purchased. Needless to say, no advance notice of this was give,n and by the admission of their own staff  British Airways management just don't care what impact this will have on  customers who have paid a great deal of money  to fly premium class. Based on our recent flights with BA where we have witnessed penny pinching devaluation of the business  class experience, to the extent that there is now no comparison with other similarly priced airlines. Their cavalier approach to customer care may result  with others like us saying last time with BA ever!"
7.0,"My son and I flew British  Columbia from Glasgow to Paris on  Sunday 7th January and returned on the 11th. On out outward journey, the London flight was cancelled, so there was a  delay on with our Paris flight. We did get  to London, the staff were great at helping us transfer to the 5B terminal to get the flight to Paris. But I noticed that by the time we would get to Paris, we would have missed the last shuttle bus to Disney. I mentioned this to the crew, who were very good at helping, realising that I was travelling with a young adult with learning disabilities. During the flight, one member of crew kept me updated. THere were some BA managers onboard as passengers.  Once we landed, he came back and told me that one of the managers would get us through to the taxis and explain to the driver where we were going and ask for a receipt. (My  memory is minimal, so I'd have been lost) The manager told me to keep our  bus passes and receipt amd claim  them for the taxi. My son and i had a great weekend, got home and a couple of days later, I claimed for a refund. Alas, the computer said a big fat no. It was just bad luck that we'd had to  switch flights I  know that it was a BA manager who told me to claim and it wouldn't take much to  just find out who flew on the flight. But still, no. Our  airline won't pay  back because we didn't have a long enough delay!  So legally, BA may be in the right, but morally, well. Even the insurance company thought there should be a bit of leeway. After all we were delayed due to a cancelled flight - their fault. Usually BA are brilliant when we fly with them and I cannot fault any of the frontline staff. Just that blooming computer. So I am 80 euros down on the  refund and 32 euros for a transfer I couldn't use."
4.0,"From Heathrow to Cape Town and the British Airways bag drop and  boarding staff service was great. Onboard,  an evening meal was fine, but  the inflight entertainment choices are very poor. Films, TV  and music choices are limited. Cabin crew were courteous , served one drink and then  some - but no more service after that. Overnight no water was offered, we had to keep getting  up to go and ask, and  we only got  cups measures not bottles. Breakfast choice was fair but the food was awful! Luke warm gunge, cheap cereal, tepid tea - truly not worth bothering with. I believe this is usual as my brother had similar experience a month ago flying business class from Mexico. I will think twice about booking British Airways again . I have  less choice."
3.0,"I was the  first leg of  the British Airways  journey on BA056  in Johannesburg to  Newark Heathrow on  27 January. While  the majority of  crew onboard where  helpful and friendly,  this was the  behavior of one  individual within the crew who was serving my husband  that left us both feeling extremely incensed that we  had paid a  lot of money to basically be  served by a  completely petulant crew member. She is  obviously in the wrong job because  she had zero  personal service skills and treated us  like if we  are a major  annoyance to her. British Airways may have some great crew who go  outside of their  way to make your flight a  very enjoyable experience,  however if you  were unfortunate enough  to experience the  following negative behaviour, this makes you anti booking future  business with this company. Is this really the way  it wants its customers to feel? Being a member of cabin crew  takes a range  different skills -  if you present  yourself as a  truly amiable part  if the team  giving your passengers a great flight , you can  walk away knowing  you have fulfilled  your part, instead of putting so  many energy into  doing so little.  After all, isn't  it us, the  people who choose to fly with  you and support you as an airline. Check in crew at Johannesburg could also do with training on  professionalism and smiling  - instead of  the greeting, no  thank you's"" and blank faces."
10.0,"British Airways return from Glasgow to  NEW York via  London on A321  to Boeing 747-400.  The domestic flights are nice enough,  good legroom and  comfortable seat, drink and packet of  biscuits or biscuit . LHR to  go both ways  in the 747-400, the crew friendly,  all the seats  very comfy for  the 7 hour  trip - they maybe difficult on  a longer flight but for this . In flight  it is very  pleasant Very pleasant flights and would  recommend"
10.0,"Flew British Airways from Kuwait to  Dubai via London Heathrow return, out  28 December, and back on 10 January. Although the  aircraft were full,  all cabin crew  was efficient, friendly and professional. I  had World Traveller Plus on the  return legs, and was more than happy with the  good choice of in-flight entertainment and the food. When I headed out to the galley to grab a single-malt scotch mid-way  on the flight to UK, no  problem at all.  On the return flight, I had the best fillet of beef I have ever been  fed in an  airplane and the red wine served  alongside it complemented  everything nicely. All aircraft were in  excellent shape: the announcements from the flight deck kept us informed, and  both flights and landings were smooth.  My transit through Heathrow Terminal 5 was hassle-free (although I did deliberately choose to fly  to Sunday both ways), and my  husband made it  home with me : the connecting  journey on the return flight was  shortened to just over an hour because of the late arrival of the domestic flight).  One of the best sets of flights I have ever experienced: in  fact I have written to BA , thank all  their crews involved."
6.0,"Vancouver to London with British Airways,  Premium economy seat 12A. In flight  heating was inoperative and the food  tasted awful. On the way out from London the food was very good - why  such bad from Vancouver? On the way out thre were trim bits loose inside the cabin giving the impression of bad care. I don't  think the extra fare for premium economy is justified unless reasonable food is provided in both directions. Flights were on schedule, but on arrival we had to wait at London T3 for more than 20 minutes for a gate."
1.0,"Edinburgh to San Francisco via London Heathrow. Flight was great until I found out my  bags hadn't made  their 1 hour connection. Was promised  by customer services  and before that  the 1 hour  flight was fine  and all flights were via Heathrow T5, this was a lie. EDI to LHR sector  was delayed slightly,  bags made the flight but the bags didn't. I was promised by ground staff the  plane would be quicker to the  plane than I , again this was a lie. 24 hours later  those bags haven't  come and are  still in some office somewhere in  san Francisco. Other than that I have no idea where they are.  British Airways  Customer service line is next to  useless with employees that do not  understand English and read from a  script "
6.0,"Frankfurt to London : Efficient and  quick check in, security queues were too long at  London Bus transfer  station terminal to  try to board  the small plane.  Was significantly delayed  getting to air  cargo control, and  so passengers had to wait inside the small Embraer , which wasn't  very pleasant. Seats are a bit  bigger than other  light aircraft. Snack  and a variety  of drinks were  provided by nice  cabin attendants. Very  long walk from  gate to UK  immigration control, greeted  two long queues at immigration counters  and 1 desk  open for non-EU . Inefficient baggage reclaim given I still had to  pay for my luggage after the  long immigration queue."
7.0,"An early morning British Airways flight from Gatwick to Salzburg, at 06:45. Train connections from  Queen Victoria are infrequent at this time. Train station is in South Terminal while British  Rail check in counters at North  Terminal Very crowded shuttle transfer for  passengers but check in was efficient.  A crowded terminal ! Flight delayed  owing to fog  but arrived on  arrival at Salzburg.  Cabin interior was old but clean. Breakfast box was disappointing as the sandwich looked like it had disintegrated,  no good service from cabin attendants. No jet bridges at Salzburg and bus transfers from  terminal to terminal building. Very efficient border control and baggage reclaim."
1.0,"Miami to Manchester via London Heathrow, and from the first flight on 28th December until our return from  Manchester on 12th January, our flights and issues with British Airways were dreadful. Zero customer service, change of planes, awful food, rude Staff, and lost luggage - British Airways made a lasting impression on our Xmas holiday. My family and I have been fortunate to  travel with other major airlines and never experienced anything like this. We spent extra money on upgrading our seats to Premium Economy and the service was appalling.  we would not recommend BA to  others and felt so strongly about the lack of  experience we felt compelled to write this blog."
4.0,"Bangkok to London Heathrow on British Airways. I have lived in Thailand  for 4 years now and try  and go back to the UK  At least once  a year to visit family and . Normally, I  fly either Emirates  with Manchester or  at Heathrow with  Thai Air. This time around, BA came up with a fairly competitive price. The aircraft wasn't in particularly impressive shape and  their entertainment unit  looked quite outdated  so didn't work  within the first 2 hours of  my flight. Once it did work,  its screen was awful and very  slow I can't fathom why BA are using outdated  entertainment systems when rivals such as  the Emirates and even Thai Airways  have much more .. Inflight service was okay for the most part. Regular trips by the staff for  help in the  initial few hours,  but this certainly  slowed down afterwards. After using the call system to get the attention  of a staff member, I was  politely asked to  switch it off and asked if I had a problem. No problem,  just would like a drink please.  The alcohol (apart from wine) had  ran out. I'm  never a massive  Brit but do  like a couple of whiskey and cokes on a flight. Also, there was no Wi-Fi,  no charge points  on mobile devices.  That is again  in contrast with Emirates, Thai Airways and EVA. All in all,  I have to  agree it was  another disappointing experience. I won't be using BA again  on my next  trip to the UK."
8.0,"Hong Kong to  UK Heathrow with British Airways. Efficient check in at the Airport Express in-town check In (train service from town to airport). Flight delayed but smooth boarding. Clean cabin, cabin attendants were very helpful and willing to serve. Dinner was  OK with a good cup of English tea afterwards. Cabin was quiet for a good  while Entertainment system was OK, choices of films (mainly non-English ones) can be expanded. Cup cakes was offered as mid-flight snack. Breakfast was horrendous. As always very long immigration queues at Heathrow, especially when the flight  is delayed with many other long haul flights landing  before my flight.  But good value for money."
2.0,"I booked an extra legroom seat , payment was  made and the  booking confirmed. When  i checked in someone was allocated  seats and in  the seat I  had paid for.  I was given  one without extra  thigh room. I  am advised to  complain to Customer  Care which is not easy via  email or online.  I filled in  the form on  request to get  the £10 back  and I will  receive a response  reply in 28  days As you might have guessed  its is not  my £10, its  rather the fact  that I had  spent the time  and ensure my  booking was as  comfortable as possible  despite the ""I  will give a  shit attitude of  the Airways once  a mistake was  made  British  Airlines needs to  raise its game."
8.0,"Flight to London  again on January 4th and a good experience. Full flight on old but comfortable Boeing  737 Efficient service  and cabin crew. Snacks (shortbread, popcorn or crisps offered with coffee, tea and water. Landed on time despite  slight delay at AMS due to  lack  captain  kept passengers up to date. All  In all a very good experience."
4.0,"On evening departure  of BA28 from  Hang Kong to Heathrow, plane fully  booked (pre-Christmas season)  and all classes.  First seat was 2K, the senior male purser presented himself and addressed  everyone with my Christian name -  I did not  really had the  impression that this  is part of  the nice intimate  atmosphere During the  flight I found  later that the  members of the  female pax in  first class preferred  a more formal  introduction and were  introduced with their  religious names. The  man offered the  usual welcome drink  - I gladly  took and soon  my face turned pale : the champagne was almost  as warm as  my cup of  coffee His apology  was prompt, but  very late. They simply had no  other drinks on  offer and needed  over an hour - or 30  minutes after takeoff - to have  the respective drinks  on the right  taste level. British  Airlines did not  do this service  up properly. Maybe  it was in , maybe it  was simply forgotten.  The plane had  landed in Hong  Chau about 5  hrs earlier, so  there was enough time to take  stock of the  shortage of beverages. The remaining flight  went ok -  good hosts in  a predominantly male  management team, food  is sensational, but  that was after  takeoff so no complaints in this respect. Seat was  and had a  decent sleep during  the 12.5 hour  without breakfast options  on arrival ahead  of schedule. So  was there a  right to complain  and to give  BA low marks?  Here we are  here about first  flight in a  leading European airline. The product has  to be perfect,  all part of  the game in . Serious irregularities  resulting in harsh ness of the  airline For me  it means that  that was most probably my last  longest distance flight  with BA. No marks on inflight entertainment because I  needed the sleep !"
8.0,"Club class on British Airways between Cape Town and London. Boeing 747-400 has the flat bed and while  overall quality of the cabin was inferior to the A380 between London and Johannesburg, it remains one of the better business  class product. Check  out at the BA counters in Cape Town would have been a breeze, was it  but for the unexpected six hour delay in the departure of the flight. The upgrade from Premium to Club class made this inconvenience almost bearable. However,  Cape Town airport becomes like a ghost town when all flights but  one have departed. BA's Executive lounge in Cape Town is spacious and  serves good food and Cape wines. There are free internet and computers and a friendly service, even at midnight. While comfortable, BA's Club seats on the 747 can do with an upgrade. They are configured in a 2-4-2 layout, with one passenger facing forward and the one adjacent facing backward, at the side row - the middle row has two forward and two backward facing. This is something I never understood -  two facing backward because it just makes no sense. The seats are separated by a hard plastic cseparator that moves up and down with the push of a button. Theoretically, the air hostess should walk behind the front-facing seat to serve the backward-facing passenger at the window - however, on my flight the air hostess insisted on leaning over me, pushing the button  that lower the separator and serving the accross my seat - after about three times this really got annoying. The problem is that if  we don't raise the separator, you and your fellow passengers stare straight at each other from a distance of less than one meter. Food was satisfactory, rather than outstanding. . The starter choices were poached Norwegian Salmon with marinated prawns or an oyster mushroom salad. Main courses included  choices of chicken with Port, Drakensberg trout, pasta or a cold main course salad of za'atar beef medallion. I chose the chicken and it  was OK, but inferior to my mother's Sunday roast chicken. There was a selection of South African Chardonnay,  Mont Blanc and some good reds. Breakfast was a choice of a cheese omelette, continental or a traditional English breakfast with bacon, sausages, mushrooms and potatoes. Arriving in London, I took the supposedly fast track option - a big mistake. In theory this is supposed to expedite your progress through customs as a Club passenger, but in practice it was a disaster -  you were only two or three border agents present <mask> any time and it took 45 to 60 minutes to get through the fast track immigration - I could see group after group of fellow BA passengers clearing the slow lane long before I took the next few steps forward. BA arrivals lounge was <mask> welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of Heathrow Terminal 5. All in all, not a bad experience, but having <mask> on these seats quite a <mask> times over the past 15 or more years, I really think <mask> is time to either upgrade the Club cabin on the 747's."
2.0,"Just returned from  Orlando to London  and Miami, that we booked direct with British Airways.  Our outgoing flight  is really good.  Then a totally  similar story on  the return flight. We were redirected to check in  with American Airlines  but we had  no internal connecting . Although we  checked in shortly  when the check in opened, the  airline seating was  available meaning we had to pay  extra for flights we believed we 'd paid in full. Additionally my  ticket was split ! The AA check in would not allow us to check into the long haul  flights from Miami to London. After  this we discovered we had been checked in but not allowed to  swap seats. I've  spent a week  seeking an apology  to BA customer  relations and I've had several stock responses and been  met with the feeling that they  just do not  think about their customers. From their response it is  quite clear they  may not see AA as part of the same group ""one world alliance"" I used  too be of  a view that  I didn't mind  spending a bit more for BA  as their service  was really good,  and unfortunately they now seem to  offer a budget  friendly service. I  write this purely to warn other families to be aware of the danger of booking with British Airways but having a  return flight with  AA part of the ""one world ""."
8.0,"London to San  Diego with British Airways was a pleasant experience. We left with a  brief delay due  of the traffic  at Heathrow (although boarded on time) but landed almost on time. We  flew an A380  and my seat was somewhere in the back on the upper deck. Enough legroom, entertainment  was personalized and very easy to use. Although it  is a day-flight we got additional to the usual blanket and pillow,  and small toothbrush  to paste. The  tea was good (served 2 times plus snack) and  so was the  red wine they  served us. I  love the complementary drinks, alcoholic or  not The crew were nice and  professional and careful  with our needs.  Many of them  are even wearing Santa Claus hats making Christmas feel like home. I  would fly them again, not only for the tea  I serve."
2.0,"Copenhagen to London : a very full plane, with British Airways staff not limiting cabin baggage. Some people  travelling with 4 bags + overcoats led to overloaded bins. Crew frantically trying to move bags to any  small space in and around seats. My nicely pressed suit jacket rammed into a gap by a staff member ended up like a J-cloth. People using their  hands throughout take off and landing despite announcements to the contrary. Ran out of drinks and ice, so no drink on a 2 hour . Where have the standards gone?  Have raised this with British Airways but no satisfactory response after 4 weeks."
3.0,British Airways flight  to London to  Los Vegas reasonable with just enough  noise from the  flight crew to satisfy. Upgraded on  later flights to  First Economy. Awful  flight with crew  who spent their  days in a  corner discussing their  good times in  the Vegas. Dreadful  of broken seat  while the entertainment  center froze. Not  sure I'd ever fly British Airways  unless there was no choice!
7.0,"British Airways from Bangkok to London Heathrow, and BA is really slipping down the quality %. With these  very old Boeing 777's, business class  looks pretty poor. No usb sockets,  poor IFE screens and power sockets  which cannot be used with British . Thin contents for the amenity bag and tired seating really shows up against the competition."
7.0,"British Airways from  Birmingham Heathrow to  Cairo took off over one hour  early due to an unspecified technical  issue Economy section full. Seats generally  around 7 inch  which provides a  wide selection of  entertainment and music on demand. Food was some kind of chicken curry , a salted chocolate caramel mousse plus a roll and cheese. Close  on arrival they  offered a cheese croissant plus additional  cheese Alcohol available  for free until around Egypt. One serious cleaning issue  was seat 34c where the side  to the computer  screen looked like it had never  been cleaned hence  the detritus had built up. Pleasant crew, just one extended message which  mentioned non safety  related which could 've been omitted."
1.0,"Welcome to Business Class on our British Airways flight  via Madeira to London on December 28th, paying a  total of E105 per person. Disappointed  by our reaction. Our seats were  a comfortable business class as I  described but exactly  exact same as  the uncomfortable economy  flight seats behind us, distinguished only by a curtain defining where economy  flight finished and business started! British  airline standards are  low"
3.0,"London to New York JFK with British Airways, and abyssal customer service. Onboard the flight  should be great, and it's the website and shoddy call centre staff who let them down. However, this time the onboard  food was as bad as the ground service. Food was poor. I was in the upper deck with only 5 other business class passengers, and yet my  seating choice was gone. The TV's didn't work in 2 seats -  I couldn't be  persuaded to try a third and  opted to just get some sleep. The staff insisted on forming a cliquish huddle and were speaking so loudly I couldn't  just sleep with ear plugs in."
6.0,"British Airways from Houston from London  arrived in premium economy. The seats could recline a lot and were quite large. However the TV screens  are beyond small. It looked like ones from 2002 were better. There was virtually no difference in food to economy (except you had more than two choices), and champagne was served before and after takeoff in glasses. But after 10 hours the  seat becomes very uncomfortable as you cannot lift the armrests away, because the tray table and remote are stationed in there.  This made sleeping hard. Don't fly premium economy British Airways, it's disappointing."
8.0,"I flew British Airways from Bucharest  and London Heathrow return, with A320 , A321 on ! The service  very good, meals okay, good staff.  Our return flight was 100% full  and we were forced to check  in hand luggage,  this was rather  annoying The flight  to London Heathrow , not on time. It had a 30 minutes . Overall, the  best experience for  an amount of money required on  this route."
7.0,"Avios points flight to London from  Toronto for Christmas in Business class. Slow queue for check in though  - flying just Christmas there were a lot of  passengers and luggage to be fair.  Our BA club  cabin at Pearson remains well run and clean. Too few toilets and a really unimaginative wine selection being the only issues.  Just the usual slow service taking coats (I had to ask), papers, drink, menu amenity  etc - very random and fragmented delivery by an assortment of crew. The meal service was fast with  coffee served first.  An evening meal  was average at best and overcooked,  half the tray  arrived with the starter and dessert  served on it with the hot entrée dumped on the tray and that was it. Had to ask for cheese and a second coffee. Across the piece,  I can see the cuts and  cost saving British Airways are making to business class. Even now -  my two posh chocolates have been replaced by a unwrapped chocolate finger,  one flower in  all toilets, no drinks offered after dinner. The list goes on! Breakfast  is nothing special with an egg  with bacon muffin which is at  best edible (unlike the previous bacon baguette.) Reasonable entertainment . Crew were the usual indifferent long haul ""I'm here as a favour to you "", with little rapport or effort  at delivering a  world class service! I think the main problem British Airways have is  a dated cabin ! The ying yang seating in it's day was innovative and one of the first  had flat beds.  Now crawling over a stranger to  reach the isle, being bumped by people and carts if you're on the aisle, and a lack of  aisle space mean  that the BA  cabin is way  superior to Air Canada and a  few of the middle eastern carriers.  Passenger loyalty is  constantly being tested and with the constant devaluing of the Executive Club benefits including mileage  for availability and cost I am now questioning my loyalty to British Airways."
8.0,"London to Mexico City return flights on British Airways  for me and my partner using Avios and an Amex companion voucher. The flights were on time, seat very comfortable, entertainment decent, and the food and drink  were of significantly  better quality than its Club World equivalent. Cabin crew on both flights  were excellent."
1.0,"Las Vegas to  Vegas with British  Airways was awful.  We were in  business class, travelling  to 2 young children and wanted  not put them  to bed on  the long flight,  so we had  booked a row  for 4 seats  so we could  fit one child  each adult. We  check in at  economy class which  is delayed, as  we are busy  they have moved  2 economy passengers  from the first  class line to  pick up things.  When we are  back one of  my seats has been moved, the  staff are unsure  due to why  but will rectify  this immediately and bring my boarding  passes to the  gate An hour  later I go  through the check  in desk as  none from BA  have been bothered  will come -  i am then  told actually your  computer is broken  and we can  help and its  not my problem.  The seat is  near the middle,  so it means  having one child  alone on the  side of the  cabin or the  2 children together  leaving me and  her husband alone  at other side  in the cabin.  Any other options  but British Airways  is not prepared to ask anyone  about swap seats  as we can  put 2 together  at different rows.  They kept the children together behind  us obviously meaning  we could not  see the whole  flight and my  husband was alone.  Then the lamp  above my childs  seats malfunctioned and  went on full  tilt the whole  whole flight keeping  one of them  isolated - the  children were unable  too override the  problem - seriously.  BA did offer  to seat my  children at the  rear of the cabin in a  different seat, alone surrounded by strangers  unable to move  her to the  middle which would have left my  children completely alone.  Checking out outward  flights from London  to Vegas one  on our seats  had malfunctioned and  my tv etc  shut down for the entire journey , nothing the  airline staff could  fix then either.  And they are  on planes! We  are still waiting  on a response  form British Airways."
6.0,"Munich to New York JFK via London in Club  Class and Premium Economy. After flying  up front on long haul trips for the last 15 years I  picked up the  courage to give  Qatar Airways World Traveller Plus a try. First Galleries lounge at LHR was good and had my fill from the very  best food and drinks. Upon boarding I was disappointed to find that the cabin was yet to be retrofitted with the new (allegedly) much  older product. Despite its age the seat was comfortable but the only good feature is  its foot rest which is quite  helpful and helps  when trying to  get some sleep. IFE has improved in the last 12 months with about 10 current films, although the screen is dated both in respect of size and resolution. As a Gold Card holder I expected a bit more personalized service, there was no recognition of  Gold status at  all Crew were experienced and delivered a good service despite a full cabin. Food (Tandoori Chicken or Beef Cheeks) was excellent and virtually a Club World meal - in fact it was better than previous Club World meals I've  enjoyed on recent trips. All in , good value  on money when not paying full  price and given that Club World is so mediocre, Premium Economy is adequate for flights 7 hours or under."
1.0,"watch out for  possible diversions at  night We arrived  to Pisa on  time circled for  20 minutes and  were diverted to . This was  because of fog  in Pisa and the fact that  there was no  emergency landing system.  I subsequently found  the the ILS  have not been  working for some  days and will  not be working  in a good  condition yet. Fog  very common at Pisa in the  winter We could  be a last  ditch diversion because  of unexpected factors.  Although there have been frequent diversions . British Airways  gave no advance  warnings that there  might be trouble. We had a  long wait at  a deserted Genoa  airport and no  British Airways or  British staff were  on hand to  greet or offer drink or food.  Finally one lady  came to show  us to a bus which took  me on a  12 hour journey  towards Pisa. We  had a 12  hours day with  little to eat  or drink. Our  only complaint is  that with advance  warnings from BA we would have  provided water and  food if we  had known what  would happen. In  that event, BA  could have done  better to provide  us refreshments."
3.0,"British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Glasgow. Shabby cabin, lacklustre cabin , flight deck crew whose announcements were mainly less than informative. A crew which appeared to be going through the motions with little enthusiasm , as little engagement with passengers as possible. Some time after the cabin crew had closed all of them, the overhead locker above my seat fell open  BEFORE the plane even moved off stand at LHR.  On descent into GLA it opened again and hung  there for several minutes and I  felt tempted to  go and close  until I made  the passenger across  the aisle aware in case the bags fell out on top of him. Eventually, the  flight crew member whose jump seat faced up that aisle got up and closed it. We should have been sitting upfront given our ticket class (part of a longer trip), but, after service issues with BA and a long journey prior to  this flight, we couldn't be bothered pointing that out. Just another shabby experience to add to the other disappointments with regard  regards service and lounge provided by BA on a long return trip involving two other airlines, who were streets ahead in all ways."
8.0,"Malta to Gatwick.  I have gripes  over British Airways pre-flight charges (I had to pay £30 for checked baggage and £21 to change seats), but in my case the total  value of the flight was only  marginally higher than  my equivalent Ryanair flight, and the  increase in comfort  and service is  worth the extra  Premium Cabin was  nice and the new slimline seats were quite comfortable.  Everyone was upbeat and polite, and  had a snack  in a well-packed lunchbox. I wish  BA would offer inflight wifi and  power outlets, but  as all BA  planes are this  nice and only a bit more expensive than Ryanair/easyjet  I will fly  on them more often."
2.0,"Flying to Dublin via London after  breakfast Was excited as on British Airways A380. What  an disappointing flight. The service was terrible, very young and inexperienced cabin crew. Had to wait ages for them to answer  a bell when I rang it.  Food was awful,  our partner didn't  have a bread roll or milk with dinner. Seats  got bigger in this plane but  very uncomfortable. The worst of all  was the luggage , 23kg! Other airlines allow 30kg in Economy. What  poor performance from  the airline when we were 3kg ! Also having  to pay for seats if you want to book them is disgusting.  We will never  take British Airways again."
7.0,"That was my  second time on  UK Airways flying from Tel Aviv to Philadelphia via . The seats were as comfortable as economy class can be expected  should be, though  i would've liked  my headphone jack to be on  the front of the armrest rather  than on the  back (which led  into the jack on my headphones  getting bent and  broken Food was  pretty good. The  best part of  the British Airways  experience was the AVOD system. Flights were on time except for the expected delays at  JFK My only  real complaint is  about taxes and fees that British Airways charges even with award tickets ; it almost  eliminates the benefit  in using an  award ticket. All  around British Airways  is better than  other airlines, but not at the  expense of Iberia  which I flew  all my way  from Tel Aviv)  but probably well below Emirates, Singapore and the world's  biggest airlines."
9.0,"My family and I had a very good experience  traveling from Nice to Montreal via London Heathrow. Both  airlines landed before  ours and staff was very helpful in both flights. Meal quality was  better than expected and we were given seats with enough leg room, which appreciated because we were travelling  without an infant too young for  our seat."
2.0,"Bangkok to London  by British Airways on 3rd January. This was most probably the worst  experience I've had in 15 years.  Flight crew were very poor, only seeing them when serving meals. No one came round  for drinks or snacks during a 13 hour flight, if you wanted anything you had to go to the galley - and then they were unhelpful, I was only offered a bag of crisp! The seat was very narrow and the remote  to the entertainment was on top of the armrest. Food was below the the standard I would expect from a national airline, small portions. Main meal and a pice of cake. No offer for a second cup of coffee. Overall a most unpleasant experience, I would not recommend British Airways to anyone."
1.0,"My partner and  I traveled British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana  Friday 29th December.  Despite checking in , and paying an extra £45 each way per  person to reserve seats after already paying over £4000  towards our flights (wasn't a major  problem and was expected), we discovered that selecting our  own seats was fine, but our return seats had only 2 seats left both on opposite sides of the cabin. Being  the nervous flyer I was not up for sitting  on myself for nearly 9 hours  and we decided to try to discuss the issue at our baggage  dropped off point,  a gentleman working behind the drop off was as  friendly as he  can be, but  also said that we would have to raise the issue when we left Punta Cana,  and that it  was likely for us to be  able to do anything because remaining  seats would be  used for business  and first class ! Getting onto the plane we were the first  people to be  picked up to board before economy which was good , getting onto the aircraft we  found an extremely dated plane, with  display screens the  sizes of my iPhone and worn tatty seats with not as much leg room as other airlines we have flown premium economy. After take  off we were given a meal , the only  meat being chicken or beef which was okay, flight  staff then offered  free drinks -  after we had  no drinks gave us at the  appointed time two  glasses of sparkling wine which we hadn't asked for , we were  happy with, and thought that perhaps the service would make up for  our dated flight.  Until then 5 hours into the flight we had  seen absolutely no staff whatsoever and  we soon discovered from overheard conversations that a lot  from the onboard staff's family were on board and  they were all  staying in Punta Cana for 5  days before flying home. One member  on staff appeared around 6 hours into the flight , gave their  parents and friends  champagne from first class - and  waved past everybody . My partner  immediately asked a staff member for 2 glasses of water and we were told we  will have to walk to the back of the  economy cabin to  fetch them. When  we arrived at the back of the crowded economy cabin we discovered  the staff fast asleep and had  to wake somebody  for water. 1 hour before descending  passengers were given tea and coffee and sandwiches which were fine. All  passengers in our  seats looked half asleep, with hair all over the place. Considering this  is a 2pm  flight you'd have  thought it was  another evening flight.  I arrived in Punta Cana at 7pm extremely disapointed  at the poor  food and the dated plane we <mask> endured for almost 9 hours. "
2.0,"Back to Johannesburg , with British  Airlines This was  the first ever long haul flight  I see my  sister get married  in Zimbabwe. I  went in for  a big shock , not a  bad one. The  seats and room  was not really  that different to  low cost airlines  and this was  another 11 hour  journey - jammed  in like sardines  you got no  food Freezing cold  feet all the  flight back from  London and again  so cramped that  if the person  in front of  you puts the  food back, you  can eat your  dinner I used  another connecting flight  from Bulawayo which  flew with South  Africa Airlink and  even though it  was only a  4 hour flight,  the food was  much better and  the plane far  too comfortable. A  really poor experience  with British Airways  spent GBP 4000  extra for the  four of us  just get there  to back. I 'll never be disapointed with Ryanair  or easyjet again. British Airways   are trading on  a name only."
6.0,"I usually fly  with Asian airlines , EVA, Korean,  Chinese and accustomed  of their very  nice service and . This was  my first flight  on British Airways  to Vancouver to  Dubai via London.  We selected it  irrespective of price.  My experience was  excellent Plane was  the older B747 , interior showed  its age. IFE  was outdated. Seat  quality was fine.  Flight crew not  complaining between meals.  Airport food offerings  are ok. Had  2 hours layover  from Heathrow. British  and ground staff  efficient and pleasant.  I might fly  British Airways again  as equipment is  comparable to A380  and Boeing 787 , price is  comparable to Europe."
8.0,"Had to fly British Airways London to Delhi, due  for a rebooking . I had missed my connection from Frankfurt due to delays by United inbound from Houston. Ground staff most helpful, lounge impressive. Cabin crew  nice and attentive, food was good, unfortunately, the seats were a bit outdated for 2015 and desperately need to be upgraded.  Flight was delayed by a bug in the entertainment system, which was fixed promptly and the Captain made up for lost time. All in all, it was a good flight."
9.0,"Paris to Los  LA via London ! Smooth departure at MAD and  Paris and transfer at Heathrow. Lounges at Madrid Barajas T4 and Heathrow T5 excellent, but  crowded and a  little frayed at the edges at  Los Angeles. No  problem with baggage or delays. The Boeing 767s used  for London and  Paris are so old they're almost  black with LED  LCD TVs and  brown leather seats, but comfortable, spacious  and clean. The A380s seemed almost  like the seats are a little  narrow but comfortable,  while the inflight entertainment is excellent.  Good amenity kit and simple but  excellent quality food.  Quite nice that they serve traditional  British things like brunch and afternoon  coffee and they offer excellent wines  and drinks. Nice  overall mix of  very professional and attentive cabin crew on all flights."
1.0,"Copenhagen to Chicago  from London Heathrow.  British Airways club world is the  only business class  plane I've flown.  Rooms are tiny and the picture  taken is awful - thankfully I had my laptop with me, as the TV was . The tables  sit at an angle, so expect your food and  drink to slide  out (although the  toilet is probably  their best place for their food).  They would advise you to eat at the airport  - not rely  around the inflight slop.  You'll  risk someone climbing over you (or you'll have to  crawl over other people) to get  into the toilet  this is business class!).  And then they'll lose  your bag, tell  that it's going  t take 4-5  days to get  it to you  but provide no  information about what to do in  that meantime. If  I try and  try to get answers, leave at  least 45 minutes  early to sit in a queue (and then expect  you be put  next to the  right person, despite selecting the correct option in the  exit menu!). Avoid British Airways wherever  I can!"
5.0,"British Airways from  Manchester to Newcastle via Heathrow return,  always on-time. Economy on an A320.  Was much better  on domestic legs,  and both times on VIE legs . FA’s were  good but nothing  more and not  any more than  absolutely required. Information from the flight  attendant was friendly  and excellent. A snack and drinks  are served -  including a highly  expensive sandwich (barely  served on the  Domestic flights and  two on the  international flights. Additional  beverages on request.  We featured the  new slim seats . I miss  those older more  spacious BA seats with better leg room. BA has  recently changed the  policies and travelling  around with hand  luggage now also means that one  was no longer allowed to pick  the seat during  flight but a  passenger is randomly  selected Selecting any  row (even a  single seat in  a back of  plane now costs  around 18). If  one later decides to check a  piece of luggage  then costs are  another whopping EUR  100 at the  airport or EUR  500 online. Being  from Sapphire does  NOT help either.  No privileges here;  just the same  prices for seat  selection and checked luggage. So, BA  had a low  priced model, except for drinks service.  Unfortunately the prices  may not reflect  a change in  cost On the  return leg LHR-VIE carry-on luggage was  not policed. Although  the carry-on luggage  is the weight  limits and fits  in the overhead  bins and has  been without any problems on the  first three legs  of twenty previous  BA flights, I  am required to  check it in.  It was also  always a question  of occupied space,  and it happened in the priority ! Hopefully just  the power trip  to the gate ? However, here  was the main  point of BA,  which was a carry-on policy that enabled passengers to  comfortably travel without  any hassle of  carrying bags. Boarding  at the same  thing was again ! Instead of  one boarding, there  was now four  separate types of  automatic boarding, and  the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood  around blocking the  entrance to the  gate so that  eventually it became a cattle call  for everyone boarding  at the same ! Another thing  was that recent  changes in BA’s  frequent flyer program  made it impossible  for reach a  club status even  as regular flyer  when you regularly  use Club on long distance routes.  Perhaps BA is trying very hard  and annoy its  frequent travelers. While  we stopped flying  Club with BA  about a year  back after they downgraded their Club  Economy cabin and  I was avoiding  their long distance  flights for a long time due  of their terrible  boarding arrangement, I  felt BA’s European  service was a  better product and <mask> was using <mask> regularly for <mask> flights. However, after all these recent changes, I will only book <mask> if they <mask> the lowest or close to <mask> lowest fare. <mask> flights to <mask> UK, KLM <mask> to look <mask> good again. <mask>"
7.0,"London Heathrow to Barcelona, and for some reason British Airways continue to run this Barcelona service from the  old Terminal 3 at Heathrow, rather than new T5. That apart, this  service was fine. Boarding was quick and efficient. Seats in Economy are now pretty similar to those on low cost airlines. But this handluggage  return ticket cost  no more than one with Ryanair from Stansted would have. Food and drink was the now standard minimalist option on most European flights these . Just one question - why,  given this is the British national flag-carrier, does the  beer trolley not  have some British beer, rather than identikit continental fizzy lagers? Departure and  boarding in BCN was on schedule, and exiting the  airport a breeze."
4.0,"London to Newcastle. Been a while  since I last  flew British Airways,  disappointed to see the same old planes in use  but now very much looking their age for domestic use. Technical issues  on departure, normal  procedure but the noise the plane made on taxi  lasted far too long and was slightly alarming and not the norm.  This pitch belongs on a dodgy charter not the national carrier surely? Last time flown I got a nice sandwich and drink, this time  the small bag of crisps and  coffee It's time  they stopped taking it's domestic (no competition routes) for  business and upgrade the fleet on short trips, the numbers onboard justify a better level  of service considering  these extra fees now attached for checked in luggage  and just carry on, puts me off using their long haul option with ever increasing fees whilst oil prices have been rock bottom for  too long now?  Bravo to the pilot for landing  - Monsoon like conditions with very  limited visibility - if only the aircraft quality matched their pilots!"
10.0,"Jeddah to London  flight with British Airways. Punctual, clean and efficient. Good quality food and multiple drinks served  with red and white wine plus  our excellent British  Airways Film selection , with the  usual on demand 6 inch seatback screen; slight delay  with screen registering  excessive finger pressure and 3 minutes of advertisements prior to each film.  First class cabin  is half empty  while the front  of the plane was virtually empty,  allowing plenty of space to stretch."
3.0,"London Heathrow to Lisbon return with British Airways. Decent  service but the  crew onboard was  terrible Pilot and first officer sounded  calm and professional , kept us up to date with flight details etc but cabin  crew were cold and had a  general ""couldn't care less"" attitude. Why  take this job if you seem  to hate it?  Poor service when I flew London Heathrow - Lisbon.  Really a shame, especially as when you are really scared of flying  we could do with a crew with a different  attitude to passenger service."
1.0,"We booked a  long round trip  from New York ; London; Paris  and New York.  I showed up  at JFK 2  days before my  departure and was  advised that my  flight had been  canceled which meant  they had no  tickets When I  went to British  Airways customer service, they said they  could investigate how  that happened, which  could take 24-48 hours but that  meant I had  my ticket. They  would not rebook  the ticket. They were entirely unsympathetic,  as though they  had made a  big error cancelling  my ticket. I  am forced to  purchase an expensive ($1300), last minute  change for which  I have still  not been reimbursed,  and though, finally,  London Airways acknowledged  that they had  committed a big  mistake I can  justify making an  error I cannot  forgive their unwillingness to help me,  because they put  myself in such  badly compromised position.  Back to the  airport on first , British Airways  Consumer Service assured  us that my  original ticket was not affected, and  had even sent  back an E-Ticket  version of my . But, again,  on morning of  a return flight,  it told me  they had no  replacement ticket. Only  later did a  representative finally admit  to an error had been made,  so he rebooked  the return, at  great cost. Over  a course of  3 weeks, however,  I spent at  most 10 hours  working to get  the problem sorted : first at Heathrow Airport, then  over the phone , on email,  so I was  still left stranded  on my return . I am  disappointed that British Airways was so  indifferent to the  mistake which they  cancelled through a  simple error, and  yet I have  still not received  a refund for  the outbound ticket I was forced  into purchase."
5.0,"At Heathrow to  fly with British  Airlines It is  nice but really  not business class  so expect more.  Economy lounge at  airport crowded with  good food. Plane  room and cabin  area - really  far apart -  you want to  check the storage lockers. Service pretty good, food good  (& breakfast was  almost non existent).  Nothing horrific. Not one good film to watch and  none that seemed  good Small range.  Hotel is comfortable flat. Phone customer  experience at BA , usually a good experience. I  cancelled it because  of not much  information on this  flight but I 'll try Air  France next time."
4.0,"This was and will remain the first and last  flight I will  fly British Airways.  having flown this  route numerous times  and with a  similar UK based  company I thought  it would try  it I expected a comparable experience at least, whilst hoping for something a cut above.  On the outbound flight we were  promised orange or  water the return  it was orange juice or water but only half  our cabin was served so we  did get anything.  The menu did not correspond with  any food on offer and the  choice of meal  options became no  surprise at all  until halfway through  on the cabin  consisted of 32  minutes they ran  out At least  in the return  trip they managed  two thirds of  their cabin section  before the options  were up again.  This was a  couple of very  unhappy passengers who  questioned what exactly  they paid extra ? A minor  issue was the  service was right through the economy section which I'm  sure got on  the passengers nerves.  Some were ok  but the quality  of the media  screens was poor , the touch screen was unreliable  and a number  for them didn't  speak at all  and more upset  if I gave  out on mine , watched movies on my phone, the quality was  vastly superior. I  had heard good  stuff about BA  if that was  in business/club or  economy class. Maybe  just what they  focus on."
2.0,"Cape Town to  Zurich via London return. I was disappointed in my long haul flight with British Airways. they squash you in like sardines on a long haul and offer  comfortable seats and tiny, rather blurred screens for movie watching. Our flight from Geneva was delayed for 40 min whilst they ""looked for someones lost baggage "" making us very stressed about catching our flight home  next time. The service and food was ok ,but the fact that  we lost my luggage on my return flight from Geneva to Cape Town was really hugely inconvenient. I expected much more from British Airways."
3.0,"Having previously flown  with British Airways on their European  route I thought  I would take  the long haul  flights with them.  We arrived 2 hours before departure at Heathrow Terminal  2 and couldn't  really understand what was going on; the queue to  actually drop my pre-checked luggage was  still very long, hearing customers complaining they were standing in line for a good hour,  adding that there were no signs of BA taking any steps to remedy the situation. Even with my frantic tweeting at BA, nothing improved.  The situation boiled  back to the  fact that only 4 desks were open for the  travelling public on  a day that  BA finished. Needless to say, whoever was in charge  all day didn't  even know what  we were doing , caused a lot of agro  with many customers,  so BA needs  the take full  advantage of this. Once these proceedings  had passed, I  find myself boarding the Boeing 747-400  which was tired  but not very well maintained. Leg  room was atrociously tight, with a metal support for the seat in front of me limiting the actual  available legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good selection of films, but was made to be disappointing with  their meagre 7""  by 9"" screens. The staff was very friendly. Looking  around our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best  and find some people seconds if they were left  out after the meal. The meal was decent, not fantastic.  My  only note when  it comes to food and drink  is that more  options should be  more available. I  felt myself constantly thirsty and having to go back to the galley  and ask for water. All in all, I wouldn't  bother with BA  or using their  flight services unless I were to  fly in Business or First. The ground service is terrible. I am  really disappointed given  what decent their short-haul flights are,  considering how much they pride themselves  on the quality  of their products  for that market."
1.0,"British Airways from  Newark Heathrow to  London from Terminal  4 in coach . Check in . No boarding  pass for people  travelling with children, a first for  me for any  long haul flight.  Five minutes before departure, captain announces that someone has  been in a  bag but has  not turned up  so they need  to take off  the offending suitcase. Fair enough. The  airline had botched up loading the suitcase by marking it to be  in a container in which it  fit Result they  are taking off  with the containers one by one  and searching for the flight. Captain  announced that he  could give any  passenger 90 minutes , after that  first announcement, a  weary and jaded cabin crew literally ! After 90  minutes they realised  some people might be hungry and  stopped serving juice.  Finally after 1  minute 45 mins  crew said that they had found  this rogue suitcase and we will be off in 15 mins. The  aircraft suddenly started a push back without any warning. The aircraft was a jaded B747-400,  cramped seats, poor  landing equipment which had to be  replaced thrice before  it worked. Once  more the crew  decided that people were hungry so  we will not  have a drink  and they will  stop serving lunch - possibly an excuse to do  more work. Lunch was ok. Second  best service was  a snack before landing for which  we lost the  last meal I  had requested, and  they tried to create one by adding a fruit  salad to an  earlier meal. Overall  bad airline, with tired and jaded  management and an  increasingly tired and  unhappy looking staff."
9.0,"Back to Orlando , 27th November.  Still the same  airport every year,  like in previous  trips everything has  looked great apart  form the food.  This year they 've upped their  ante with the  customer service and  accommodation In the  UK there has been a huge  cultural difference between  the world from  Orlando and Heathrow,  and very little  difference"
9.0,"Third city break, this time Glasgow to Munich return via Heathrow. Four  good flights, on time, aircraft clean and comfortable, crew ! Catering on  all of the  flights was a  plus and on  Saturday a lovely turkey and cranberry  dinner plus a  great bar. Great hotel and the whole experience great value, only negative  but no direct flights anywhere from  Munich"
1.0,"Booked a very expensive London to Bangkok flight for my wife and I because it was the only direct flight, and  as we expected to get a decent service for this higher price.  Our British Airways terminal was hopeless, impossible to find your way around with no signs anywhere, and hideously overcrowded. Onboard my  computer system never worked, then a few minutes into the flight both  the wife's and my neighbour's entertainment systems also stopped working. Tried to read but my  navigation light was broken. Tried to  sleep but my neighbour's light was  off and on - could not  be turned off.  Nothing but it  took 3 months to get a satisfactory reply and all they offered was a £100 voucher for future BA flights! Like I'm ever going  the travel with  them again. They're  one tired, overpriced airline."
1.0,"British Airways cancelled  the holiday flights to Egypt (Sharm el Sheikh) today via text. We  went online for a refund which  told us to phone a help  line (Indian based  call centre). We  were told we have to wait 7 to 10  mins for a  total refund? The  flights were booked  in March. After waiting on hold to complain to a supervisor for  about 20 mins,  I still didn't get to discuss why it takes  this long for a refund? I phoned on another mobile and was told no supervisor was available! If  anything you need  help don't bother with British Airways. "
5.0,"Phoenix to London Heathrow, and this was our third time flying First Class on British Airways, and after flying this time, we are disappointed.  The BA lounge in Phoenix is disgusting. We could handle it only for about 5 minutes. From the staff, the seats, the space,  and food, nothing was orderly, clean, and it all seemed run-down. Walking around the airport aimlessly was a much better option. The boarding process was a joke. Again, the staff seemed confused, clueless, they called for everyone (all statuses, memberships, traveling with  friends etc...all at once. It seemed nearly half of the plane was lined up to get in during premier boarding. There were 3 cabin staff for first class, two out of the three were not at all cordial. No greeting, they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin was not full. They were not well groomed or spoke politely - came across unprofessional. This ruined the experience of  flying first class. The meal experience was horrible. I ordered an appetizer, salad, and an main course. My husband ordered the 2 appetizers, and a main course. They came back to tell us they were out of one of the appetizers he ordered. First time this has ever happened in first class! They brought my appetizer, which we had to share, and they completely forgot about my salad. They brought the main (chicken dish), which was cold and dry. I had to send it back and changed to a steak. The steak came after about 20  mins Roughly 1/4 of the steak was hot, the remainder was cold (not even warm). The taste was amazing but ruined the dining experience completely. Upon waking up I opted to not have breakfast but have biscuits. The menu had ""assortment of biscuits"" and a few other bistro type items. When I ordered coffee and biscuits, the flight attendant looked concerned and said ""let me see if I can find some biscuits for you"". She came back with a bag of popcorn, a browny, and a few vanilla wafers. Typical items served on a domestic US based airline. My husband ordered coffee as well and asked for half and half. She failed to understand half and half and finally said ""oh you mean half and half in British accent. How is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an American  request for half and half. Normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this <mask> seemed like the icing on the cake. Toilets were small, cramped, and dirty with no typical First Class amenities available within the toilets. Our next leg was within EU to Munich on another BA flight where the service on a 737 surpassed their international First Class! Seat is comfortable but that's about it!"
9.0,"Ocean City to  go on holiday  with parents, and treated with courtesy.  My mom asked  for tea to  get cleaned up,  mom asked her  whether the tea  tasted too strong.  Friendly treatment but rarely found in airlines in Europe or America. Short 1hr 20m flight  with full breakfast  being served to  business class passengers.  Recommended and recommended."
9.0,"We flew GRU-LHR on the upper deck in seats 63AB in business class. We were able to use the new TAM lounge at terminal 3 GRU, this was an amazing lounge, huge, lots of food and drink on offer, showers, sleeping area, lots of seating. I was apprehensive about the seating plan on BA , the reverse seat by the window and the aisle facing forward. Travelling as a  family this seating actually works really well, it's good to be able to chat with each other throughout the flight and is much better than the Herringbone seating - that being said if you are travelling alone I can understand why it may not be preferable. Offered champagne  before boarding, before dinner further drinks service. The food was excellent which included dinner and breakfast prior to arrival. The seat  is very comfortable, full flat bed,  my only problem I found was  being 6ft 1in,  my feet touched the wall at the end and  I couldn't fully stretch out but this did not prevent me sleeping. Upon arrival at Heathrow, the luggage was coming around  a carousel by the time I got there, which was only about 10-15 mins after disembarkation. My only complaint I could find was the Entertainement was slightly limited, and there was no USB to charge my phone, but this is an older aircraft."
7.0,Flew British Airways  from Prague to  New York via London. A really  good experience for  our price. Comfortable seats and a good inflight entertainment. Not that good  food though. We had to change our flight but the service was  still good. Our  luggage were put onto another flight but they were delivered for free to our hotel  that same night.
7.0,"Flying VIA LHR with British Airways. Overall good experience. All flights on time. Transfer in LHR T5 very fast and easy. For the long-haul flights: comfortable seats,  good IFE, lots  to choices availeable. Food was decent for economy. The only downside: Flight attendants failed to give a good service on all 4 sectors. Not one staff member gave a service  and a smile."
5.0,"Third time flying  the British Airways A380 and the only reason that  we did is because it was  the BA Amex 2for1 redemption. However to ensure that  we maxed out the experience, as  usual we pre booked seats. On  checked in online  we had been moved, contacted BA Bronze and reply  said ""cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available  at check in"". Check in, no ? On board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be ""normal"" passengers, i.e.  an entourage. Seats we were allocated,  toilet and head rest functions did not operate, cabin  crew tried rebooting  with no luck,  back onwards and  out Having flown BA a reasonable amount I have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on  the Heathrow to LA and return last July where we had the  same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed  for the flight out) manage to  keep a brave  game face. BA  Lounge Lounge: Again,  seat choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot BA? Cabin crew: Service very good and  Quality Food reasonable,  but nothing that  made you say that ""that was good"". Entertainment: Poor, old ""ish"" and  third rate movies,  enough said. Seats:  Again in this  case we leave the worst till last. Having flown  on Emirates and  BA A380's like everybody else we  wonder why BA did not take the opportunity for  the redesign of  equipment and seat . Well we  asked why = £££'s, Question? Does no one on the BA cabin design team wear . There is no storage space,  unless it goes  into the drawer with the shoes,  You have to  move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility  for either wearing and damaging said  shoes or hanging  out over the separator. Again, competitors  do it. The seat itself, is  bigger than the  one above (mattress?) and apparently I discovered that extra  blankets are no longer carried, so  I have one and thats it.  Sadly we do , have to  leave BA next March, but have  booked Qatar again for October. Additionally,  our Customer Service service in India is sadly woefully short in all  areas although polite working from scripts  and unable to  explain / answer simple questions. Frustration.  Next question for  us We really want to support and be proud  of our national  budget carrier but <mask> are the <mask> for using <mask> I do <mask> mean cost."
9.0,"Flew from LGW-BCN on the A320 seated in seats  4 Lounge at Gatwick prior to boarding was very nice, offered good food and drink selection including champagne on request. Cabin crew friendly and attentive. I was a bit apprehensive  of BA's new business class product but the seat was comfortable and  having the middle seat free does  allow for more  room although the leg room is a little tight, but okay for a short flight. We were served  a cold meal which was quite  good along with complimentary drinks. I  highly recommend British Airways."
1.0,"Flew British Airways from Salzburg to London Gatwick. Check in was very slow. Boarding at Salzburg involves a bus ride out to the plane. No attempt was made to separate passengers by row numbers onto the two buses used,  which other airlines do in a similar situation, resulting in an absolutely chaotic boarding process. Cabin crew were off hand. The in flight snack was thrown at  and served to passengers. The totally  inadequate ""sandwiches"" offered consisted of rubbery processed cheese between two thick slices  and poor quality bread. The one consolation was that the flight lasted just less than two hours."
10.0,The wife and  i flew from Heathrow to Amsterdam  on business class  with a free Avios upgrade with  British Airways. We  made use of the galleries south  bar in terminal  3 which had  very good variety  of drinks and snacks. Full meal on the 45 minute flight The  price was very  good but I  would not pay the asking price for such a short trip. Great  as its almost free.
3.0,"Recently flew to  Dubai on British Airways and was  completely underwhelmed with  their experience on  my BA A380. I travel regularly in business class  on Emirates, normally  flying the same  flight The BA  class upstairs is  extremely cramped and  feels inferior to  Emirates Airlines, even  at the extent  where having to  climb over other  passengers to leave  my seat. In  fact the staff seem preoccupied with  their own arrangements  and although were  polite with me,  and mildly irritated  with the requests  of other passengers,  even commenting to  each other in  advance of me.  The cleanliness of  this plane also  leaves a lot  of be desired,  with only a  handful of hours  before the flight,  all toilets were  filthy with the  seat awash - I don't think crew check them  in a regular basis. The window  seat has side  washing facilities, which  on my case  had a disgusting  looking yellow fluid  and rubbish in ! When mentioned  with crew, they  kindly get some  plastic towels to  clean it out,  so needless to  report I didn't  use it (photo  ). Overall poor  value for money."
1.0,"Paris de Janeiro to London Heathrow. Several weeks after  booking our flights on-line, for reasons unknown BA moved  away from the  flight we had  booked and put us on to the previous day's flight. I had to phone them (it took 20  minutes to get through) and re-book us on to the flight we  were booked in  the first place. The customer service department is totally useless. I have sent several e-mails asking why they did what they  do and all I get is meaningless 'off-the-shelf' standard replies. I have asked three times for the name.  number and address of someone I can write to  for this but they consistently fail to give me this information. I presume the tactic  is to make me so fed up that I'll just give up and go away. A second-rate airline  that is definitely to be avoided."
10.0,"My husband and  myself flew to  Canada with British  Airways on 2nd  December 2015. We  were due to  fly to UK  by 9th December in Premium Economy.  Sadly our flight  was cancelled due  an engine failure. British Airways were  able to get  us onto a flight on the  next day, Thursday,  night so we were booked to  Vancouver on the  Friday 48 hours  before we were due to return home. Despite the  extreme disappointment and  inconvenience as we were due to return to a  normal work schedule  on the Friday,  British Airways were excellent. They couldn't  had been more  kind and accommodating, putting us up  at a lovely hotel for two , providing food , and then  transferring us to  first class when  our were eventually returned home. The  hotel and flight staff at Vancouver  were fantastic, understanding and went the  last mile without  complaining "
10.0,"Full flight efficient , friendly greeting  from Purser. Flight crew kept us updated on hold , efficient and  fast inflight service  for a short  return flight, cabin interior immaculate. I  had no checked baggage so from the plane to the Tube was  only 7 minutes."
9.0,"Manchester to New York JFK via  BA was enjoyable from start to finish. Admittedly the Boeing 777 was  showing its age  but would benefit  from some TLC! However the connections  were on time, cabin crew were friendly, helpful and efficient. My wife and I thoroughly  liked the food on offer. Prior to the trip I was concerned about using BA  but after 30 or more years  of happily using  British airlines. I was very happy  about everything. If  I picky about  comfort it would be that the strange yin-Yang seats in Club World  are narrow at  my shoulder for  me but once  on the lie flat position I found the seat very comfortable. AVOD was a bit  slow and clunky but did work, screen a bit  dim and duller  than comparable screens I've used with Air France"
7.0,"British Airways Business  flight from Bangkok to London. The Lounge at Bangkok  is signposted and a long walk  from check in. A very relaxed lounge and plenty  of food and  drinks options. The  passengers on the  plane to London  are friendly. The layout of the seating as has  already commented on  before is very . Who wants  the sit facing  their fellow passenger for 11 hours?  Flight 5 Heathrow  Airport departure is  a disgrace. Surly  delays on security , not a pleasant experience. The  lounge was crowded, it was a  flight far too  crowded and not a relaxing environment.  NO Television to  keep you getting bored. There are  no warnings about  the long it  will take to get to your  destination There are  also enough boarding information screens to keep you updated. The flight was good and good ! This sounds  like a moan  but the flight, except for the  layout of the seats, was excellent.  No work needed on the little  things that matter."
10.0,"From British Airways  - GIG to  BA Nice easy  check in with no extra charge  For an overweight  passenger Got 4  tickets together even  tho we couldn't  get in online.  Good legroom for a tall man.  They were all  nice and very  friendly and helpful.  4 meals which  are pretty good  on an airplane  and drinks on  board I emailed  his request to let my father in law see  their cockpit after  landing and they pulled out all the stops for  him Made his holiday.

1.0,"People have been  flying to the  US regularly from England and have  noticed a consistent erosion in the quality of its  booking process, website,  contact centre and  support staff. The British Airways website  remains unreliable and  prone to returning  to errors even  after carrying out  this simplest of  checks Its upgrade  service is impenetrable and designed to  ensure call centre  staff do not  like to speak  English and make  their requests and  all staff are . Examples: Cannot  sign in online,  or via the  phone on a  flight no problem  ( I wanted a printed boarding pass). Call centre  personnel in India  refuse to speak to my 5  month old daughter  and my family  for me one one trip, as  she was on  the different booking , wouldn't give  me her flight  ticket number ""for  security reasons"". No  help with ""security reasons"" when I  owe BA a  lot of money for the ticket.  Even with points , Avios fails  into the middle  if a transaction. The system remains  unable to check  passengers in for  any time after,  and you have to call the  calling centre. BA blacks out so  much flights from  Europe with Avios,  its not worth trying unless you're  travelling and can  change any time, and don't care  how you go.  In the queue  for boarding my  door wasn't open  in the right  place and the  woman at the  desk admonished me as a result.  In another occasion  at passport control  when checking in  and was directed  straight to the  same desk I'd  just come from.  If nothing wrong  in your passport, it must be ! It's not us"", was the  message It took  the huffing, tutting, BA duty manager  then run the  security check again. I advise people  to avoid BA  if possible. The  primary reason for  choosing BA is  for safety. But  most airlines manage  it too, with  a smile. So,  no excuse."
2.0,"On British Airways  from London Gatwick  and Salzburg. Agent  for baggage drop  were rude and  off hand, she  continued to take  a well under  her sized cabin  luggage for ""free""  bags as hold . Even when  she explained that  bags contained valuable  food and medication,  they still persisted. Boarding was efficiently , a pleasant  departure from the  flight for all  we experienced on  my last BA ! The cabin  crew made no  attempt to greet  us or help  when stowing luggage.  The snack included  on the ticket price consisted of a ""muesli"" which  is yoghurt with a few oats  stirred in, a  small a unbuttered bread roll containing  a slice of  cottage cheese and a very small  coffee cup of  water Service was  done in finesse.  Only one plus was landing twenty  hours early."
3.0,"Royal Airways flight : Punta Cana to London. The  service was awful , the cabin  staff gave the  appearance that they  were doing us  no favour when  talking about their duties. Not a pleasant experience and  a last time  we will use . The fact , they fly the flag for  Team UK makes it even more  embarrassing "
10.0,First flight with British Airways from  UK Heathrow to Singapore Changi. Boeing 777-300 was a great aircraft and must have been nearly new. Wonderful  staff onboard and good food. British Airways continues to set high standards.  I look forward to our next flights with you.
10.0,"Super short hop  and flight time  only 30 mins.  Started on time  and despite full  duty cabin crew  provided a service with a decent  mug of tea , a very  good bacon sandwich,  and no additional . Very friendly , efficient service.  Nice plane, comfortable , Exactly the  ticket for the  same trip a  couple days later.  US Airways flight  with LHR to  London was impressive  year round."
8.0,"Very abrupt check-in  time at SEA.  To board, PE  was full so  has an empty  seat next to  PE contributing to  lack of additional  baggage PE brings.  Friendly and friendly  plane although one  or two FA's  are a little  dated in appearance.  A BA plane  with very good  seat system/choice/screen size , comfortable seat.  Air quality good.  Limited flight although  Qatar Airways PE  well worth the  premium on new  check out standard."
6.0,"Flew British Airways from LHR to  London Very good  experience at LHR  airport and fortunate with efficient security checks. On board, very full flight  - hadn't paid  much to book  in early so suffered with seat  left by the window. Old fit-out 747, small screens very poor for watching what was  otherwise decent selection on IFE. Paid extra for enhanced meal service which  was a big plus. Could be improved by offering better quality wine as meal is  pretty standard. Definitely  worth the extra (in the context  for onboard catering)."
9.0,"Flew British Airways back from Bangkok to London Heathrow  near the end of our holiday and I was  so much looking forward to Club  World on a  747 having started the holiday with a flight in  Bangkok in an  airport (absolutely wonderful). I was very pleasantly surprised. Checkin involved no queueing and the same through priority security. Had access to  a Cathay lounge  and this was good. The pleasant  change was the Club cabin. I have got used to the rather warn and used state of the Club World cabin  in BA’s 777 and 747. This one appeared very  modern and smart. The seats we find comfortable and enjoy the ying yang seating for couples travelling together. We found food  could be very  good for the two meals we were served. The final comment is that the staff appeared to be friendlier and more enthusiastic about their  work We found the staff on the flight home  in Club were  helpful and attentive. Overall,  a very enjoyable flight. The IFE was the old product but it works and managed to sit though 4 films to pass  the time."
9.0,"2008 British Airways TXL-LHR-TXL in Business Class. Aircraft looked new, bright and clean. Seats in Club Europe are  reserved IFE is not available, except  for viewing the route displayed on  flight maps. Cabin  attendants were attentive and quick in offering drinks and  snacks On the flight back, I really a tasty  potato salad served with white wine or champagne. Perfect  service and smooth , I would definitely fly again and recommend them.

3.0,"I have flown  UK Airways Business  before and was  impressed with Lounge,  customer service, Elemis  soft showers wit  spa products and  special request champagne.  All with comfortable fully reclining seats,  meals and amenities  were dispersed per . Staff friendly  and accommodating, cabin  and deck- A380)  nice and comfortable.  Our next trip  in August was  last minute with  First First available. I felt very  comfortable booking this since my experience in business has  never been very  comfortable My past  trips with First  were to renovated  and separate seating  but I felt  this was still  meant to be a lovely, comfortable  flight with enjoyable  service So, with  all the changes  to First now, I thought I  might really be  in for a  nice treat. I  wanted to preface  myself by saying  I have always  loved British Airways  it has always  made my first  choice for London- London JFK-London flights  most years. I  got a early  morning Checked in  and ample time before my flight.  Then went straight  to the Concorde Room to have  lunch What I  am met with  was basically a  buffet style, self  serving service. There  was no table , two people  sat behind the  service counter. I  met an English couple while waiting in-line to put  on a simple  two eggs on  our order as  usual and we  had both told , the toaster  was in front  to us, and  I needed to  go on own . It all  started downhill from  there The wait  seemed long, traveling  by your own , had to keep an eye  at your table  and make sure  it was not taken, tables were  left unserviced and  even I carried  the dishes to  the front just so I could be seated. Boarded , seated, and  started looking around  and the carpet  is dirty. It  appeared as it  had not been vacuumed from the  previous flight, which  does not give  you a clean  or comfortable feeling.  Then the steward  came to me and said they ran out of  the toiletry kits  because they do not allot according  their reservation, but  were catering to  people traveling on  business and not  those traveling on , He offered  a Men's toiletry  kits and a  First Class kit.  When food was  ready I started  with their appetizers  which was all dry and very  expensive (and I  am not picky),  but for me  not find it  good it has  not be poor.  Even the entrees  was short and  we had to  wait a second  meal Any one  of these events  can be okay-  Even though they  say that all is superb, but  something constantly occurring had me regretting  what paid for  it and have  asked for the price differential vs . and quality, <mask> Business Class <mask> out hands <mask> The food <mask> far from <mask> or tasty - it felt <mask> and choices <mask> and short. <mask> Pilot did <mask> out and <mask> if BA <mask> call me and he was <mask> apologetic (I <mask> a Steward/ess <mask> the faux <mask>  - <mask> consented. Disappointment <mask> consistent from <mask> to end <mask> no call, <mask> email, no <mask> - in <mask> opinion that <mask> the epitome <mask> service from <mask> to end. <mask> left me <mask> that BA <mask> did not <mask> about any <mask> it - <mask> service in <mask> the appropriate <mask> of food, kits, cleanliness- all <mask> it. My <mask> back to <mask> I flew <mask> It was <mask> Though there was less space in First class <mask> years ago, <mask> the service <mask> brilliant and <mask> and the <mask> was delicious. <mask> am sad <mask> experience this time could not <mask> to years <mask> by - <mask> if it <mask> more simplistic. <mask> review is for First only."
9.0,"Fantastic flight in Club World with British Airways from London Gatwick to Punta Cana. On time departure from Gatwick on a 777-200 - it's true the plane was showing its age with a little wear and tear in the cabin, but seats 2A and 2B were comfortable and functioning perfectly. Greeted by friendly mixed-fleet crew and provided with champagne and  breakfast kits before take off. Prompt lunch service after  landing and a  full menu with excellent wine choices.  I enjoyed a goats cheese and honeyed walnut salad, followed by steak in a port wine sauce which was well cooked and tasty. The delicious Castelnau brut rose champagne was available but disappeared quickly so I recommend ordering this promptly. As this was a leisure  holiday all champagne did run out about 3 hours in, for which  our crew apologised ; but there was plenty of red and white  wine available including an excellent Chablis and Medoc. The Club Kitchen was well stocked throughout and manned by a friendly and personable crew who  were always willing  to help. Plenty of juice and water runs throughout and a very pleasant afternoon tea served an hour  from landing. Bathrooms were well stocked and cleaned regularly.  Our entertainment system was great in Club with a decent selection of new release films,  though the screen resolution could be better, especially Wilhelmina the cabin lighting is on full. We were kept well informed of the flight progress , by a cheery and personable First Officer, who navigated a mean-looking thunderstorm near landing with aplomb. All in all this  proved a relaxing , luxurious way to begin our holiday and a great to example of BA at  its best."
7.0,"Welcome to TPA  via British Airways.  Our 777-200 was  a older aircraft  very clean, very friendly crew, all  friendly and helpful. Food was ok,  several different choices,  but sadly ran  short of red wine mid flight.  Otherwise ok for  long apart from  a woman in  front of me , must have  realised she was  flying Club and  started trying to  change her seat  off a flat bed. "
10.0,"Heathrow to Cape  Town with British Airways. I was aware that the 747 is past it's best but I had two wonderful flights due mainly to the  fantastic service from  the crew, who are better than  any other airline I have travelled.  We did however have maybe the  smallest seats ie  28 and 28j in the entire economy section which give unlimited legroom and a speedy  flight The food was extremely good , dinner and breakfast served. The  seats were spotless.  🙂"
4.0,"Very disappointed with British Airways. Very  little leg room,  and only 5ft 7in but I had to sit sideways for the flight. Food very  expensive only a roll on both  my outward and the return flight at 5.30pm. Other airlines offer a snack. Wouldn't travel  UK Airways again,  cheaper airlines have more leg room."
6.0,"This was the first time in a decade that  we have flown  British Airways economy across the Atlantic  from London to  Dublin It wasn't  as unpleasant as  I had expected  and I wouldn't  regret doing it . I was  disappointed by how  bad the catering has become, including breakfast being reduced to a roll. Having said that, I'd be happy  to buy some food at the  moment if only  it would allow  us to buy  some decent bottle  a wine on . It's when  we pay for premium that the food becomes annoyingly  expensive"
8.0,"British Airways from Gatwick to Las row return, both flights both on  Emirates On the outward flight, we  was served sparkling wine before departure,  while the return , juice and water were offered.  Each flight included two meals of  high quality, although small portions. Soft drinks were provided at intervals during the flight. This Premium Economy cabin now feels outdated, with no at-seat power, and a very small IFE screen. The best part was the  comfortable seat and  arm room, which  make a big difference to comfort. Flight attendant service was professional."
7.0,"Tokyo Haneda to Brussels via Heathrow on British Airways. Good check in, security smooth due to fast track.  No Japan Airlines ! Boarding was messy and shameless. Once onboard, you  realize how old and worn out these British Airways planes are, they need revamping. Service  is okay. Food was a shame but staff was attentive. Transit in Heathrow fabulous lounge. The connecting flight  is late and no food available due to delay.  We give you a 15 Euro voucher, British Airways get your act together."
3.0,"From Vegas to London Heathrow in November, after the Thanksgiving Holidays, we splashed out some  nice points for  flying First Class  - I have  NEVER been so disappointed - Business Class on British  Airlines is better than First as the cabin is  far cleaner and  brighter The first class section was dirty and cold, the Entertainment System broke down and  needed to be  fixed again and again. The service  looked good but food was nothing special. I must say I am very disappointed as I was looking  forwards to this upgrade. However, there was nothing First Class about it.  We have flown with Qatar Airways and Emirates Business  class First and they both beat twice over."
8.0,"UK Airways from  London to Gatwick . Boeing 777  New World. Having  missed out WT Plus to Miami , got a  great deal coming  in from Tampa  and flew Club . Checked in at Tampa with  few queues, and used the International  terminal at Tampa.  Not to be  similar to BA  - this had comfortable seats, and  decent choice of  films and magazines.  Did not try . However, there  was disappointingly very  poor choice of  snacks - a  few dried up sorry looking sandwiches , were not  served during my  stay there, and  served with some  cream cheese with a few dips,  some wine, beer,  coffee and soft drinks. Pretty uninspiring . On board  were if narrow,  seats that extended  into (more or less) flat beds.  US Airways still  uses the very  traditional 2-4-2 layout  with fellow passengers having to clamber  past people to  move to the  next room etc.  First meal (beef)  followed by an  aged Chablis Premier  Blend and a  rather nice Sauvignon . My wife  slept for 5  ½ hours -  and could only  sit fitfully as not much room at shoulder level  but at least  her seats were  full Terrible selection  on films on  their entertainment system.  Started off on  time and landed  very early. FA's  were smiley and  friendly"
6.0,"To Heathrow to  JFK on one of British Airways ' Boeing 747s.  - Booked WT Plus choosing flight  with an A380  with shiny new  upgraded cabin and  sound system for  2 year in a row, and  now the 3rd year in a row they promptly changed the plane on my flight for a very  older and not  new Boeing 747.  Does BA actually have any A380's? Reasonably comfortable, but  the old on demand entertainment system  and a poor choice of films and programs. Cabin staff and food  were from memory but, as usual  for British Airways nowadays, very small portions. Took off  too late in fog, made up  for on flight  but landed slightly  later at Miami. Old aircraft notwithstanding I still think  a Plus is well worth the  cost - 7  inches of extra legroom is so much more comfortable than coach."
1.0,"London Heathrow to  Los Vegas with British Airways. Online  checked in and seat allocation facility  72 hours before departure are a con! I checked the available flight seats approximately 30  mins prior to check in and virtually 95% of the flight was pre-booked! Therefore, I  went and prepaid the £70 to secure a window  / middle seat as seats had not been allocated to me and  would be until 24hours prior to check in. Then , I did check in approximately 23hrs and 59  minutes prior to  arrival I had already been allocated  two seats, one by a window and one in the middle, so  another total waste of time me  paying £70. I got a refund, but only have the inconvenience of  checking online forms  and waiting around a month to get my money ! Then when I did get to the airport,  2 seats I had already paid  an extra £70 for had been allocated to someone else (after I had paid for ) they told me I had to sit in my original 2  seats that had been allocated -  another utter farce!  British Airways refused to acknowledge their systems were at fault and had use of my  seats for almost a month yet had I been advised of my seats prior to check in I  should not have  charged them £70. They knowingly do this to encourage people to pre-pay for something they  simply cannot deliver.  Our aircraft was dirty when we boarded as the fight was late,  and toilets were blocked around 10 minutes into the flight and stank - eventually they were blocked off from use, which left 2 out of 4 toilets for the entire rear section of the plane.  The food was  appalling Afternoon tea on a transatlantic flight used to be pleasant, with scones, cream, jam and nice selection  and sandwiches. Now  there is a  cut up roll and dried excuse of a cake. I am never going to fly  Brit Airways again  for the way they handled my complaint - they offered no form of apology that was meaningful or relevant to what  he was complaining  of and disowned responsibility for the corrupt way their online booking system  worked "
6.0,"From York to  meet with British  Airways and disappointed  in the lack of care provided  for the cabin . Passenger boarded with two overweight  and oversize cabin  cases that crew  had to place  in the overhead  storage bins. Coats and bags were  carried out to  the room, owners told to stuff  bags under their  seats We therefore spent the 6-7  days with coats and bags wedged  under us making  it very difficult to sleep or  move the seat ! Upon landing  they were no  crew on hand  to help the customer to get  their cases down  and to offer  some sort of apology for the  damage caused. British Airways seem to  enjoy adopting Ryanair's approach to customer . Why not  simply check bags  from the gate."
2.0,"Flight to Rome  via London with British Airways. Boarded  a plane on  Sunday (20.30hrs) and  stayed for six  minutes on the  ground while BA  attempted to clear a glitch in  its landing gear ! They finally gave up and cancelled the flight. I had to  fly to Rome  to catch a  container ship that 's departing at 8pm on Tuesday  night and here , am in  Rome at 1pm  local Rome time. British Airways ticket agent refused to  let me change my itinerary (""Go to the hotel  and the bus  leaves at 2pm today - local  times - we will have new  tickets for everyone.""). I tried to  explain the urgency  of my situation but she cut  myself off, ""I  can help you,  if I help  you now I have to help "". When I  pushed her further  they gave me  a BA 800  flight which was closed due to  the late hour.  So I called British Airways Reservations in London, who  booked me, on American Airlines. The  next kick: I  put in a  contract for a  two night's guaranteed stay in Rome,  except for cancellation ? A month  later British Airways advised me that  my claim was  valid and I  would receive payment  in two weeks.  since then, nothing for the last  two weeks. Phone  lines to customer  services involve at least a 40 minute hold. What  another horrid excuse for customer service!"
5.0,"Got to Kuala  Lumpur with British  Airlines on an  older Boeing 777-200 A business class (upgrade) which was  comfortable although choice  of IFE very poor. Crew pleasant  but not particularly efficient and since  the wife and I were seated  together in the  same rear-facing seats  it is an  accepted practice to serve us separately , her meals  are served well  as mine. Flight was punctual and we had a  couple hours sleep.  Flying back was  a Premium Economy and might as well have been on a different airline. Same old plane with TV  screens extremely small. Meals not particularly  expensive The main difference is that British Airways crew treat anybody flying  on a lower class as lesser  customers and they  complain bordering on  arrogant They forget that whatever class  or cabin you 're flying in that you are  the customer and pay their wages. Next time Malaysia Airlines I think."
6.0,"Washington to Dubai via London return with British Airways. My concern is regarding seat allocation. When we booked  this flight (2 adults, one child  & one infant),  those seats with the bassinets for  2 infants were not available. We then chose 3 seats together on the side. I presumed that those are granted first come first served, based on the  experience of the passengers that are traveling with children. Nonetheless, in 3 out of the 4 flights we took, those seats  where taken by  3 individuals with no children/infants accompanying them. I asked at the check in if the seats with the bassinets were occupied by people with infants and the ground attendant responded by ""yes"". That was not the case, unfortunately. The flights were therefore very uncomfortable due to not having  a place for the infant while food and drinks were served. I do not understand that when you try to book those seats with the bassinet, the system does not grant priority to the people traveling with infants. British Airways should consider that instead of having passengers with the hassle of keeping their infants on their laps for 7-8 hours while the bassinets are empty. The priority seating chart is for that purpose useful. "
8.0,"Pleasantly surprised with  two British Airways return flights from  Manchester to Las alle via LHR. Great crew on  the outward flight , whilst we  sat in economy  we were treated to champagne to  mark a fiftieth  birthday and offered the usual complimentary drinks. Two hot  dogs outbound were . Return also  good but dinner was a bit  bland chicken gnocchi allegedly but hot  and compensated for . Although the  seats were full  I was quiet and managed to  find some sleep. Only slight criticism is the in  flight entertainment. Not  much of a  deal in comparison to other airlines.  :)"
9.0,"We boarded and  got to destination  quickly (30 minutes) but inflight experience was nearly flawless.  We seemed to have some mood lighting, comfortable leather seats with headrest,  but enough legroom. Crew pleasant and hardworking, they spoke to passengers with  internet connections about the state of their flight. Vegetarian  food was welcome, as was the small bottle of  wine  It certainly wasn't the cheapest flight but I noticed the  differences"
3.0,"The wife and I flew British  Air from Heathrow to Istanbul, Business  class (supposedly!), on  the A320. We  found our seats  would be both hard and uncomfortable with minimal legroom and the hot meal provided, breakfast  in our case,  was dire. The  window at the  rear of the aircraft was so unbelievably small as  would be difficult to use. We consider that the  seats we had  to put up with were quite  good for a four hour flight. I am puzzled  that British Airways would choose to  offer such a miserable Business Class  when it would be more honest and cause less  confusion if they  chose to declare all their European  Airways flights to be economy only."
3.0,"i think one word sums it up 'Rubbish'. The  flight to Barbados , was passable, however the return journey was a  mess It started  at Grantley Adams  Airport where passengers were bumped off  their flight through overbooking, we fortunately,  were there early  just to be able to get onto the flight.  We sat down  and found that  my seat in  front of me  was broken, so  we had to  spend the eight  hours flight with the seat in my face, the gentleman in front  was very apologetic  saying it was not his fault.  There were no  beds and only  three cots on  board in spite  of numerous babies  using this facility, leading to very  sick and tired  little ones, a  problem for parents I would presume.  Also the food,  the A choice of peri peri chicken or pasta  and tomato and  onion no cheese  and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce, revolting. The tea and  drink was served  around the same time as the  meal so if  you wanted to  drink and have wine, by the  time you got  into your tea  and coffee it  got cold - (obviously cabin crew in a hurry  to clear). Breakfast  at an all  time low, a  thick congealed croissant  with a little butter and jam  in what can  only be described  to a bird 's bar. I  had travelled with  British Airways for more than 40 years and have  not had food  unlike this on a long haul  flight or in  most any flight. Many years ago when I used to travel from  Singapore and Malaysia  with British Airways  the food was excellent, even in economy, menu, three  courses of main  course and cooked breakfast that was  also very good.  Our cabin crew could not care  less and somehow  fail to realise  that we, the  customers actually pay  their wages. I  paid for milk  with my tea instead of the  water for coffee that was provided  but in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the  coffee was ok.  They did not feel like a  rude customer at all, just a  sad British Airways  had lost the  plot and are  competing against great  countries such as  Thailand and Singapore  - although sadly  only on the  direct route. "
4.0,"Glasgow to Bangkok  via Heathrow with British Airways. We never received ""paid for seats"" that  should have just had £160.00 refunded  back on to  my credit card  for complaining that  we never on  both legs of  these flights. We  had been told that we would not get refund as we had assistance? I e-mail them and informed I had my e-mail confirmation of set numbers and payment and seat ticket subs to  complete my claim and at no point did I ask for or need or receive  any assistance. They  have tracked and  i was informed  the claim was  rejected and it would take 6/8  years British Airways  pilots to stop this practice as it does not show the Airline  is a good light. I would be wary of using British Airways long haul again,  these aircraft are too old and  slow and the female stewardess need to go back on a training course on customer  service Spirit of service what happened to that."
4.0,"from Heathrow to  JFK via Singapore return with British  Airways Overall it was not a great experience. We upgraded to premium  class on the way back expecting  some leg room but I hardly  saw a difference!  Our plane looks old and the food was shocking! They advertise that there are great chefs picking the  best but the breakfast consisted of  what I presume was a sausage  with some type  or scrambled egg, it was not ! The flight  could not take off for an  hour because the entertainment system was faulty. The entertainment was ok, however the music could do with updating. The staff were friendly and it was easy checking in."
6.0,"Manchester to Mumbai , Heathrow return, an A320 for the shorter leg and a Boeing 777-300ER on the long haul leg. Sadly British Airways seems to have it's most rude and arrogant staff on flights to India, who treat passengers poorly and don't really care. Flew MAN-LHR-BOS return last month and the staff on those flights seemed to be much better. Same with the food - food on the  journey to and  fro India wasn't great - I asked for a specific meal on the outward journey which wasn't there and was instead there on the return leg - which I did not need. When I queried this - the answer  was ""You must have made a mistake"" and the attitude was of a ""take it  or leave it"".  "
1.0,"Welcome to London  by British Airways.  Some uptight woman  called myself and  check in made  me check my  own bag that 's substantially smaller than other bags  allowed onboard the  plane When I  return to London  and find I  brought no bag  from my vacation!  no pajamas, no  underwear no change  o clothes, no  shoes and it's  coming down rain  & cold here.  :)"
4.0,"They were not  allowed to check in online for  our British Airways  journey from Bangkok to London. Boarding  in a shambles , no clear boarding of business class first. I  am travelling with  one partner and we were not initially seated together.  Flight together was  only confirmed at  the time of boarding. It is unacceptable to have to pay for  a seat. Food  preparation and quality was poor. Chicken  was dry, and the appearance a murky brown colour except the rice. Meal was starchy  with both rice  and potatoes. Overall cheap! They had run out of our choice for the next meal  before the time they reached us. Again the selection very limited. Meal  was cheap and  stale and left almost uneaten. Offered  just one drink  ( coffee, water)  but no refill offered. Staff service very mediocre at best. I could not charge my computer on either  my outbound or return flights."
1.0,I travel quite  frequently to Europe and elsewhere but have avoided flying  British Airways due  the bad experiences in the past.  Recently I decided  to try the airline again -  and a big mistake! Checked in online and selected a widow seat near the front  on the aircraft.  After arriving at  Southampton I was informed my seat had been unilaterally  switched to an aisle seat at the rear of the aircraft! I  was absolutely disgusted by such treatment.  NO other airline  had done that to me ever in 20 years of flying. As  per result of this I shall now try even harder to avoid  flying British Airways  if possible. Oh and the flight was delayed and the boarding staff  were slow and inefficient. Bad experience  all round.
9.0,My first flight  on an A380 and not disappointed.  An aircraft still  very new and  a bit if  the culture shock  for so many  are travelling in  the well used BA 777s and . The first  Class cabin was spacious with large  and very private  area The aircraft  was also very quiet. Service from the staff was  professional and friendly.
7.0,"Compare Heathrow to  Poland good flights : efficient, friendly  and although the  service is so  bad these days  its not a  business class experience  any more. Reasonable  price and plenty  of drinks. No  seats in Krakow , nothing like  the seats at gate made it  very poor airport  from there. Just  about okay overall."
8.0,"Excellent flight on  Airbus A380 from  Birmingham and back  from JNB. No  issues encountered. Boarding  was speedy and  comfortable Good, pleasant  welcome from FA's. Food and drinks good, with a  very good choice  for entertainment Will fly BA as  often as the  fare is reasonable."
8.0,"I was very  happy with my  experiences on this aircraft, it was  our first time flying on a B747, and it made quite the impression. This flight was full with a duration of approx 9 hours. Rough start as we had to wait an extra 45 min for  cabin crew for the flight. Each seat equipped with a blanket and pillow, e individual TV screens with a broad range of movies/tv shows.  i am 6ft and found the  leg room to be adequate (my  knees did start  and become sore  towards the end), but enough room. Crew were great and food service the best I've received. A couple rounds of snack/drink service and a hot meal served which was great.  Plane seemed very  easy for everyone around to sleep but I can never sleep on planes so I stayed awake. "
8.0,"Outward leg in Premium Economy on  US Airways A380. Seats very comfortable,  great leg room , much larger  view screen. Food acceptable, has improved since last trip. However, Premium Economy section is now so big you lose any exclusive  features that you used to enjoy  with older aircraft. Also, what do you have to do to get  your window seat.?  Even as a Ruby member able to select a seat 7 days in advance I have just found  this to be impossible. Who or what do those guys sitting in the window seats know? Return leg on the Boeing 747-400, old but  very good condition and very clean.  Still no window seat but I do feel that Premium Economy is well worth the extra coin."
1.0,"Brit Airways online check in policy , now most  expensive Four times I have flown  on them and  three times myself  and my girlfriend  has been placed . This is  all though we  were on the  wrong booking and once this has happened in business.  British Airways charge  me just for selecting a seat. Not a better  one just any seat other than that automatically selected  by you! The  policy seems designed  and deliberately place you apart, even  when it knows that you are together. Then it charges you £18  per seat to  change your seat.  If neither you  nor your partner  want an empty seat next to  you then you have to pay to move both seats just to be together. They  also won't let  passengers checkin until  two hours before so you have  just spend one  hour of your holiday going online  or paying for  this privilege of sitting together. Both these practices are  wrong even with Ryanair, they place  you together in  a system and if you pay to change you  get priority boarding. Monarch only charge  more to get a better quality seat. With Ryan Air you can also checkin your  partner at the same time as  your outward. British Airways have sunk to new depths and I will not fly them ."
1.0,From Heathrow to São Paulo with  US Airways was  some of the  more uncomfortable business  class flights I  have taken in  many years. The  new 747-400 is  old and tired.  BA claim their  seat is 6'0 . Not very comfortable when you're  seated The seats  are narrow and very uncomfortable. Previous week I travelled  into Hong Kong with Emirates from  The UK Maybe  I should checkout  their competition! I  am travelling back  from the UK  now and not looking forward to  10 hours of  flying The last time I will  fly with BA.
5.0,"Being in a  queue for flight  to Grenada was  fast and efficient  by British Airways.  Service was unusually  quick and we  landed on time.  My seats were  great the food  and drink was  good and the  staff was just  fine which really  beats up BA.  Not great, not  great just OK.  Despite having priority  boarding on our  tickets our cases  ranked among the  first 6 to  8 although I  do suppose that  was BA's fault."
7.0,"From Heathrow to  the return, checked  out on line with only hand  luggage used the  internet to download the boarding pass  then through security , to the BA Galleries North , which was packed but had a good spread  and breakfast. Boarding  through Gate A8 onto a Boeing  777 which appeared pretty old and  not very clean,  was fine for a 1hr 20min  flight A hot breakfast served which was nice, the flight was only half full. Return  via BA app  seemed to work , checked in  to the airport,  cleared security quick and had time  at the Galleries lounge. A newish  economy seat 2F which was fine , the aircraft  was all economy layout. During the 1hr flight served  up coffee and snack. Service pretty  quick and I guess there is  one other option these days apart from BA."
7.0,"Take my daughter  into Dubai for some R and  our Heathrow check  out quick as was security. The  staff at T5  was liked a war zone, dirty  towels and plates scattered everywhere. We  arrived at 5:30pm  and the only food available was sandwiches, very poor  choice to wait , the dinner service on board,  limited drinks selection. Boarded and soon seated with a  glass of bubbles, the crew for a change were competent and approachable on both legs but slightly more mature. To be honest don't have a problem with  them but find they are lagging behind other major  airports whose lounges and service is  far superior!"
1.0,"I have booked  this flight to  Europe with my  daughter from the USA to Italy. I booked this  travel through American Airlines, and some of the flights are with British Airways. In order  for select seats on British Airways, I have to  save about $200 for the both of us, maybe more. I will never fly American Airlines or British  Airlines ever again.  I think this policy is ridiculous."
8.0,"British Airways from  London to Gatwick on Boeing 777  Sea World. Having travelled out WT  London to Miami  and got a  better deal coming  back from Tampa , flew Club Class. Checked in at Tampa with no queues, and used the International  Lounge at Tampa.  Used to be exclusive to BA  but this had comfortable seats, and  good choice of  newspapers and magazines.  Why not try ? However, there  is disappointingly very  poor choice of snacks - a few dried up sorry looking sandwiches  that were not  served during my  trip there, and crackers with some  cream cheese with a few dips,  and wine, beer, liquor and soft  drinks Pretty uninspiring stuff. On board , if narrow, seats that extended  into (more or !) flat beds. British Airways still have the very  awkward 2-4-2 layout  with fellow passengers having to clamber over people to go to the  next room etc. Reasonable meal (beef)  followed by an  expensive Chablis Premier Cru and a very nice Sauvignon ! My wife  sat for 5 straight hours -  we could only  move fitfully as  too much room at shoulder level but at least the seats were comfortable. Terrible selection of films on the entertainment system. Took off on  Sunday and landed slightly early. FA's quite smiley and nice."
6.0,"I have used  British Airways on  a regular basis between Rome and  Frankfurt My flights  have usually been  first time, most  airlines do not  notice the new  than a few  new bmi screens  outside the door.  They always order  my meals which  include good quality  for dinner, but plain cheese, cucumber  and tomoato sandwiches  with afternoon tea.  My issue is  an inconsistency with  the cabin crew who can vary  from pleasant to  unpleasant and cut corners with the  food when they  want I appreciate that the LGW base is a  lower cost"" base  for BA, but  it is no  excuse for the  crew to behave  like they do.  Emirates and Vueling  Airways look more  comfortable and are  more pleasant on  that same route. The LGW lounge  looks tired and  cramped at best.  This needs a  deep clean. FCO A has no  money after the  changes in the  cabin nor have  the other arrangements  they made. Flying  into and out  of LGW with  me you are  aware that this  does not the  same BA and  was downgraded in  several ways from  it"
6.0,"To Heathrow to  JFK on one of British Airways ' Boeing 747s.  - Booked WT  my choosing flight  with an A380 with shiny new  new cabin and entertainment system for  fourth year in a row, and for the 3rd year in a row they promptly  replaced the plane on my flight  - a very  small and not  comfortable Boeing 747. Do BA actually have any A380's?  Quite comfortable, but the old on  board entertainment system had a poor choice of films and programs. Cabin  space and food  fresh from memory but, as usual  with British Airways  offered very small portions. Took off  very late in , made up time on flight and landed slightly early at Miami.  New aircraft notwithstanding I still think  the Plus is well worth the extra - 7  miles of extra  luggage is so much more comfortable  than coach."
3.0,"Checked in and found the Club lounge was ""landside"" meaning one had to allow time to get through security after using it. I need not have worried as I spent all of 60 seconds in the shared lounge that  UK Airways use with about eight airlines. As BA  has 3 daily flights to Hannover and potentially 60+ users of the facility, I could have been forgiven to thinking there might be some decent food around. Wrong! The meal  was a bunch of dried up sausages in a steamer that looked  to samples in  the medical lab. Ghastly. A few bits of cheese here and there and that was it. I quickly moved on and had an excellent dinner in the Movenpick restaurant a few meters away.  With Only three passenger in Club  and the plane  came back 5 minutes early. The meal I was offered was a  good looking prawn salad. I declined as I was well fed. A couple of Gin and Tonics and the flight of 90 minutes passed easily. FAs very friendly. Landing was in high winds and very well executed. Was the  whole trip worth  flying for £800? Not really but then my client paid the bill."
2.0,"Dublin to London City on 2nd November flight was cancelled due to fog, queued for  2 hours for a rebooking only to be offered a flight on the following evening  as fog was due again in  November Refund could  not be processed by staff in  London airport so I had to phone the call centre. Two weeks later and I  again have not received a refund. Booked Ryanair for the following day and even though it was last minute, it was still cheaper than my original cancelled  London flight. Reluctant to pay a  fortune to fly British Airways again."
3.0,"We got off  on a good start with the  private lounge at  level 3, and  I prefer it  to T5. Decent seating. Reasonable food , plenty of  space  Plane  was newish and  in good shape. Was seated in  front so leg  rest was fine.  Anything else in Club Europe is  complete waste of  space and little  money Plane took off 40 minutes . FAs were  great Declined the  somewhat pathetic looking  cut up sandwich  that was the  last meal. Had a couple of Gin and Tonics  and Comfortable flight , about 80  min"
7.0,"The review covers  the usual return trip from London  back to Dubai.  My flights are  full and I  use points to  go to business.  There was a  Boeing 777 going  back and Boeing  777 on the  second trip. There  was nothing really  wrong with either  plane but I only really use  points for the  food and the  extra bed to  get some sleep. I don't like  their weird front to back 2x4x2  layout and cannot  understand how much longer British Airways can get away  doing this as  it is so  behind of date  by modern standards.  This is fine  if you get  the window seat  where no one  talks to you.  Having watched the  seating pattern filling  up over several  flights I eventually  paid £136 extra to reserve a  window seat both ways. After a  number of hours  my bed is  very hard and  the storage is  virtually non existent.  All said, the crew were polite , served well. They seemed to  be older and  we think that  makes the difference,  they understand customer . On the  plane one cabin  attendant in particular  were very responsive , helpful in  serving tea mid flight. Overall the product is outdated  and this time  and service was . It got  us there and  home safely and  I was fed  & watered. I am very open  to moving my  seat elsewhere though, primarily due to  my seat layout."
8.0,"Check in both  airports was excellent and priority security. British Airways lounge at Heathrow and Spa very nice as was breakfast served there. Lounge at Houston is far too small, so many 'status' holders in there that it became standing room only.  Last plane we were due to fly on went  wrong 45 mins  before departure so swapped and after delay of 2 hours they got  their 'new' plane. Sadly neither plane nor interior were  upgraded The 'new first' First class seats ageing badly, grubby and scuffed,  old electrics hesitant to work at times and old  heating system that failed during the flight. Interior much  worse on the way back. Crew excellent and attentive on way out.  Economy well presented , poor outbound,  great coming back, wine same both  flights and rather average. Surprised the  overhead baggage allowance  was same in  business classes now, In First class  You have an  additional overhead to yourself and seat storage, so why not allow First passengers to make use of it?.  My baggage labelling  as always pointless - came out  of the middle of everyone elses. The simple question to ask is was it worth it - if I had paid for it, a no. Not a big enough upgrade on business class  to justify the difference and not a First Class  option in some important aspects."
2.0,"I regularly travel  UK Airways to  London and LHR  and found them  to be nothing more than a  generic Ryanair in  terms of service.  I also flew  the longer sector  route to London)  every week and  service was awful.  With the A319  we only have  a toilet at  the rear of  your plane for  every economy passenger.  Over a 4 hour flight this resulted in massive  noise discomforting passenger  congestion the last  two rows as well as long waits for those  not using the  toilets The food was horrendous (Chicken ) and the  poor hostesses were  extremely abrupt and  totally uninterested and  honestly I don't  want them to  be the fake  kindness and friendliness ) but these  girls and guys  are genuinely unhappy  & unfriendly. As king my regular  daily or biweekly  trips between Dublin  and LCY or  on the E170  flight to LCY  is ok, it's punctual, and you  eat a stale croissant for breakfast  on it. What  really annoys me  is how British  Airlines treats its  frequent flyers, makes  is impossible to  expect any meaningful  value from BA  despite having travelled  several times with  them (every other  week at least!)  I paid hundreds  of pounds in  fares that are  priced well above  the competition. They  only have this ""seat selection"" fee  in their bronze  fare if they  have a hand picked only fare.  Some cite that  these fares are there to make  them competitive but  they really are  nowhere anywhere near  competing on routes  they sell from  BA and the treatment of regular  passengers and bronze  flyers leaves a  bit to be desired (it's basically meaningless: I would  be far better  flying on Cityjet or Aer Lingus , both server  friendly routes, for  much lower fare, while being able  only choose my  seats for free  before check-in time).  as a result, I am seriously considering my use  with British Airways."
8.0,"I decided to  book British Airways as it is now the only  budget carrier with Premium Economy between  Australia and Singapore, since Qantas now  mainly runs A330s  for Business and basic economy into  Singapore It was  another pleasant surprise with very good service and food and a pleasant  atmosphere onboard. Almost all passengers were  loaded onto London and this also applied to the return run from  Australia with almost all passengers originating  into London. This means that for  my return flight from Singapore most  British people had slept all the way from London  but were chatting and moving about the cabin, meaning  is was almost impossible to get any sleep on the relatively short overnight flight between  Melbourne to Sydney.  So if you don't mind skipping any sleep between  Singapore and Sydney  it is a  good alternative when  trying to fly  across Australia to Singapore and return. Many passengers had their window blinds shut during the landing approaches into  Sydney and also  stopped when I understood just the  opposite was supposed  would be the case for safety reasons. Not sure why BA allows  it to happen."
8.0,"London to London  on return. British  Airways really annoyed me with paying  for seat selection.  As a result,  will try my luck and board  the plane last  before paying for  seat selection. For  long haul flights,  it is worth  the risk. Otherwise,  as usual British  Airlines service. Food  quality improved over  these past few  years pilots and  cabin crews quite  seem to interact . Planes in  excellent condition."
1.0,Royal Airways London 's airport to Zurich costs double the average. The service is at  cost or below.  British Airways Loyalty program makes it  possible to reach  a level even  twice weekly and  then they reserve  a track to  Saturdays only. 
10.0,"Flight to Rome , via Heathrow  as a BA city break package.  Long delay outbound  thanks to fog gy Glasgow and  a 1 hr  delay on return  from Rome. Four  direct flights, Heathrow-Glasgow , re-booked in  Rome by check-in  staff in anticipation  the delay. The  security was tight  so we were  very surprised to  see our luggage  was made in  to the Glasgow . Cabin crew  made catering excellent  but didn't like  our type of  meal so was  given a lovely  lunch instead). Best  cup of tea  I had on  this flight."
5.0,"Cape Town to London Heathrow. The new British Airways lounge at Cape  Elizabeth is a big improvement on the lounge that used to be shared with Virgin, however it filled  up quickly with passengers for the two flights. Our new First class  tickets (2A/3A) were  just showing their  colours so the  lounge was probably one of the first to be  upgraded Unfortunately, the crew in First were young and disinterested. Neither of us were addressed by our names at any point  on the flight. The dinner service was slow and the food mediocre (cold and dry or overcooked and dry). Ironically, they  were out of the South African white wine. The entertainment system wasn't working for most  on the flight.  British Airways should provide an iPad alternative in First  when that happens. PJs and the flat bed made up with a duvet are good touches, but the flight was too turbulent for uninterrupted . The Boeing 747-400 toilets are ridiculously small for changing in and out of clothes. Overall, the experience was underwhelming."
3.0,"British Airways are not the upmarket  world class brand they were. Fact. Everything is about saving whilst extorting. The lounge at Gatwick and T5 had no hot food until certain times - like school.  A  while back they're was always superb Lounge food and not salty kettle . People have  asked for this and British Airways is not delivering which is really wrong. Bought sandwich from downstairs because lounge had no decent food. Onboard only a tiny amount of Club World passengers, yet they ran out of preferred meal choices. Starting to wonder just how  their cabin crew  are treated, because if they are treated the way passengers are, no wonder they've stopped caring. So sad for what was an iconic brand.  --------------------------------"
3.0,"Flight British Airways  from London Heathrow to Buenos Aires return in Business Class. Business class  layout is terrible , very narrow  seats which are  cramped in way  that almost in  any seat you book, somebody will step over you during the night or you have  them step over somebody else. In addition, there are screens between and  my neighbor's seat  where flight attendants  need to move  back and down  because they want  and serve passengers  that do not  need an aisle , I can't imagine how stupid the person who  devised this layout must have been. It is not  bad for passengers  nor is it for flight attendants.  The sticky atmosphere  leads to this  poor arrangement of  seating In terms  the service, this  was lousy on  international flights. There are about 4 flight attendants for about 40 Business  Economy seats. The  two attendants are  very old. It  takes them a  LONG time to  bring you something to drink on  a table after  dinner They move through the cabin  filled with drinks before they serve  snacks and desert.  Sometimes you don't  call them and  you may not show up even  when you press  the call button.  Their attitude is by and large  friendly but very formal and impersonal.  People clearly don't display any signs  or fun or  enjoyment in the  cabin Food was reasonable. No Wifi available at all."
4.0,"I have been  using British Airways  have found little  to complain about.  My last two  long hauls I have done this  trip with BA has seen the passengers wearing winter coats when flying  through the tropics due to the  weather being kept freezing. But my main complaint is the nice little  system BA have come up with  whereby you pay  the allocation and extra for bulkhead  and emergency exit seats where there is more leg , I have  already paid the high rate on  numerous occasions only to find the  seat configuration has  gone and I  am in a regular seat, the crew have been  quick to ask  me for proof! Today's flight was  no exception, I  am even given an apology or  full refund but  tried to keep  my voice down.  The crew looked tired and just going through the  process My loyalty  may have come  to an end and I am seriously considering Air  Canada or Emirates  for my next trip."
4.0,"Staff and crew  had the problems  were when we  had to deal  at the Orlando  airports in staff and customer complaints  - uk. Total  nightmare and they  simply did not  care at all.  My seats were  booked 3 months in advance as  I had a  small baby with  me When arriving  in Orlando airport  to return home  to check in  we changed our  flight to mid  flight and no  problem We noticed  someone going through  it and returned  with advise to  get our seats  if we had  changed back. This  turned into 2  hours of sheer  chaos with the  airport (including airport ) while my  son screamed the  way down hungry,  and we could  just go through  again until they  had rectified the  situation The staff  were rude and  nasty and refused  to admit they  had messed up , refused to  change our seats  back as they  just seated someone  on there who  have no baby.  As though these  seats are reserved  to people with  infants due to  the bassinet availability.  Finally it was  given back after  so much stress  / hassle. On  returning we complained  again 3 times  we got the  response yes it 's our fault  and are sorry , we can't  say anything to  be sorry for  our behaviour. Eventually  following another complaint  and agreed to  our avios and  travel voucher. I  wont be flying  for British Airways  again as they  were so bad in customer relations  and check in  they leave a  message to be ."
3.0,"Flying to Las Vegas with British  Airways and a  long flight to  stay honest. 2  drinks into a  2 hour flight  and out of  fuel for those  without drink is  NO joke. Not having the choice  of food by  what time it comes to you  in 4 occasions  over the 2  hours is pathetic - I guess you need to  actually consider where  you book your  ticket by asking  what they start serving from. I thought air stewardesses  who meant to  the least crack  a smile once  in again, and  being asked reasonable  questions (that had  only be asked  due to the  fuel shortages) were  they to be  an accommodating and  polite as possible?  Hope I never have to fly with British Airways ."
3.0,"Smooth take off and landing. Plane  is 75%   occupancy mostly business . The ""meal"" was past terrible. A horrible, tiny, dry bread bun  with a the smallest piece of chicken ever and  The most salty bacon I have  EVER tasted. The best part was the sticky bun  that followed, washed  off with lemonade.  Great entertainment for this 1hr 45min  flight The toilets were barely passable, had they been cleaned from the previous flight?"
5.0,"Gatwick to Venice with British Airways. The plane was clean, crew good and reasonably on time, with good  checks in. But the flight was  turned unpleasant by  management encouraging people to take so much cabin baggage on to the  flight The return  row was perhaps  not full, but  the overhead lockers  are full. It causes a scrum at boarding. The  first row passengers board first and stowed their cases at the front  because they don't  have to carry them down the plane. The lockers  less than full  and the forward  row boarded they had nowhere to  store theirs. It  was then chaos while the cabin crew sorted it . It should be every passengers  wish to not have luggage under their feet."
5.0,"Round trip London  to Luanda in  Qatar Airways business class (Club World). It's really below  what British Airways  airlines stand still in the competition  of other airlines.  Their seats are  uncomfortable There are  little storage for personal items. The  showers and toilets were not adequately  used up after  each flight. The  seats and IFE  were average for business class. British  Airlines should think  about improving the  experience in general or otherwise they will continue to  fall behind their  competitors Even American Airlines and Iberia,  who practically owned  the same company, have improved a lot. The only  good thing was the FAs in both legs were polite and courteous.  All were relatively young so they  should have motivation  for do their  best "
3.0,"Not impressed with  UK Airways at  all We flew back from Denver  to visiting family.  I flew out  on Lufthansa as  they were the  cheapest as we usualy fly to  Europe Middle/Far east  with them and  compare the standards  in quality they  had to offer. Our return Lufthansa flight home was  canceled due to  Flight attendant strikes at Lufthansa. We  had booked straight  on to the  next flight back  into London which  left only an  hr later. Initially  we were excited  about fly with  UK Airways as  that would've been  the first time  travelling with them , also they  had a B747-400  to Denver to  London I am  aware that the Boeing 747-400 isn't  the newest aircraft,  however Lufthansa had  upgraded the interior , new seats , side panels  and very up  and date inside.  With British Airways ' whole interior  was very old and dirty, the  seats hadn't been  painted and the  curtains in the  middle of the  plane were such  poor quality it  was embarrassing. The  food was of  the poor standard  the chicken meal  we had was  terrible and even  a flight attendant  didnt know what  he was serving.  When asked what  to dish it  and she replied  some sort of  Chinese thing"" when  it was actually  a Teryaki. The  flight hostess was  serving the breakfast  food which was  just before landing , also not  very good, and  their bar was  rock hard. British  Airways were double  our price of  Emirates when we  originally booked, however I would never  hesitate to fly  them the again  airlines of my own choice. Their  Boeing 747's are  terrible which is  a massive shame.  Compared to an airline you know . Lufthansa are  the best European  brand all round  as I have  checked and Emirates  is the best  - I hope  my review was  good - obviously  I am aware  many customers would  of had a  worse experience than me on newer  aircraft with different  routes and air  style however be  cautious when booking  with British Airways as they are  grossly over rated  and not good value for money.  :)"
3.0,"Flying with British  Airlines from Bangkok  to London in  the World. Really  The only good  reason to talk  on is the  seat allowance. The  toilets are horrid.  Flat and you  sit like you're  in a coffin  when you have  no backward-facing window . It's unbelievably  hot and when  I pay more than 4x the  cheapest ticket, I  have a place  you keep a water bottle when  my seat is  into bed-mode. The main meal outbound  had not heated , had to  get returned.   The pre-ordered beef  on the inbound  went dry. Changed  orders for the  Burger King prawn s with couscous , to be told it was  actually chicken. The  bathrooms are hideous  as there's no  difference between economy  or business. Blocked , tissue fibres  hung over the  paint stained walls  with peeling finishes. Crew outbound were  slow and very  rude Inbound was  the much younger  staff and only  1 (Spanish lady)  were truly aware  their passenger needs.  The rest were  less intent on  going to Bangkok  to party than  to serve passengers  with a smile.  Back at LHR B were all  in the galley blocking access to  every other side  to the cabin, chattering to each other and not  feeling welcome or  welcome after entering  that door. The  Last Word lounge  snack offerings at  BA were abysmal.  Nothing like a  Chinese canteen. If  anybody from BA  share these opinions,  then please do  nothing about your  own IFE. It's  outdated and that's  very polite. Fuzzy,  flat screens and  when you choose  the movie with , they're illegible.  :("
1.0,"Bad customer service.  The wife and  i have flown  with British Airways  since almost 30  years I booked  a flight through  the Executive club,  that we are  members of, nine  days before travelling.  less than 4  months later we  realised we would  have to cancel,  so after almost  one hour on  the phone on  Friday I decided  I hang up  to do it , This seemed  ot be a  simple process with  a final message  of ""we are  considering your request"". . After no  explanation at all,  we received my  debit card statement  I find a  charge from BA  was under £250  for my booking  was over £2500.  After a call  from customer services  result was I  could not get  the further refund  or be able  to reinstate the  tickets There was  nowhere else to  go to, and  unless I emailed  some of the  senior executives it  should be forwarded  through customer services  but they would not reply! I  inquired about ombudsman  or arbitrators and  was informed that  BA Airways does  not adhere to  nor listen to  those bodies. Over  and down the  two months before  take off, so  plenty of time  left BA to  refund their money  and my seats.  Wrong again!"
9.0,"I travelled from  Auckland to Sydney  and Singapore in  Australian Airways first , I found  the service outstanding,  it was good  selection of choices  and the wine  list was also . Seat was  excellent but the thing I would fault is that the armrest does  fold in to  you when in  your sleep position.  – Would fly  again again."
7.0,"British Airways have just moved Cape  Town flights to Terminal 3 at Heathrow and it's not a good  idea The Concorde lounge at T3 is looking so shabby that it's a disgrace. Thankfully, on board in the new first class was better. The crew was young but did a good job.  The 4E/F are good for a couple, but there's some lack of privacy. Dinner was excellent, which is down to steam ovens British Airways have finally fitted in first class galley. The combination of PJs, duvet and a 6 ft 6 flat bed meant that sleep actually occurred. The letdown was the breakfast which was mediocre as usual, although it was good tea and coffee. But, as others have said, British Airways first class just  not as good as Singapore and Emirates."
3.0,"Welcome to Heathrow.  My first long  distance flight with  Qatar Airways and  i am not  At all impressed. The service levels  were disgusting. No  ear plugs, No eye shades even after requests.   The service only  one showpiece. Asked  about a Virgin Mary and was give iced tomato  juice with lemon.  When asked for other ingredients like  tomato sauce, tabasco, Salt and Pepper, I was told  all this was  standard airline recipe.  My request for some salt and  Pepper to spice  the drink was refused saying that  airlines do not stock them in . When I  asked for a talk with the Head of Staff  in the aircraft, he was sorry and said the  airline was trying  to cut corners  but the crew  and were falling on deaf years.  The Only vegetarian  meal option provided  when they had  to run out. No menus etc.  Easy selection with  TV screens and  TVs  Was a Low cost  flying experience that  took a passenger from Point A  and Point B  before any feel  uncomfortable moments."
5.0,"London to Kuala ang on British Airways Boeing 777.  Board in First, return in Club  2 (business class). Flights on time  Both ways. Comfortable , and very helpful and friendly ! The quality  in food and  beverages served, (particularly  comfort food) was  quite poor."
7.0,"Flight to Las  Vegas via Heathrow.  The British Airways  first economy is  a good product,  which is great  for seat but  not really good  for sleep in.  Service was average,  never sure why  they insist on  that and then  the Service on  the way was  good on the  plane back was  awful - the  staff was bitter  - not happy.  It needs to  get updated. A  nice cabin and  seats is a  must and the  way that you  are behind first  available cabin means  people get off  straight away. All  in all a  nice experience, but  there some things  still need to  get fine tuned."
1.0,"I recommend flying  some other airline  besides British Airways. The fare looks  good until you  get to where  they have to  change your seat!  And if you  have to cancel  a flight (in  my case a  flight was cancelled)  They won't issue  any voucher or a refund. I  booked my flight  3 weeks in  line and they refunded $140.95 of  my $1003.95 ticket! And, they won't issue a voucher.  We will never fly British Airways,  they are so  cheap"
9.0,"Jet Airways First  class seats are very good compared to their business class. Truly a  great experience. Loving the windows, there’s  no cover that  can open, shade  and close. The  seats are quite  nice 1-2-1 configuration.  The Service very attentive and personal. They will address you by name the moment you walk in, escort you to your seat and supply welcome drinks, towels,  towels Food is  just to good.  When you don’t  want (parts) of the meals, you can replace from (parts) of other  meals turning it in fact into semi- a-la-carte. Return flight was over-booked.  Through phone and email they contacted me and with  my permission I  am rebooked onto  second class SQ  Singapore at same  flight at more or less the same time.  In all, it was a very pleasant experience.   My Singapore lounge does not have a 1st class  lounge and is mixed with business  class Fare difference between business class  vs 1st class is not as huge as with some other airlines. Definitely recommended.

3.0,"London Gatwick to Cancun, and I was disappointed. British Airways economy class is incredibly standard  for comparison to  American Airlines or  the Virgin Atlantic. Entertainment was not particularly varied, food  is shocking, plus  wait staff were abrupt and snappy.  We do not  speak often so sometimes I might ask questions that  were pretty obvious,  though I shouldn't be shamed for that. Not flying with British Airways  anymore that's for sure."
1.0,"I was among  about several hundred  passengers whose British  Airlines flight was  delayed last night  to Dallas Ft . to London.  A status indicating  it was put  on the displays  outside the gate,  and the decision  is made. They  was not updated.  We were told  could call 1-800-AIRWAYS  for help, but  was turned away  with the phone  line and as  an result lost  their places in . One woman  found a glimmer  of hope with the phone system,  just to be  informed that because she was traveling  without a baby,  they had to  stand back and  get in line.  All 4 ticket  counters were open  that assist the  passengers and each  one took over  45 minutes to  open on average.  Another couple took  almost 2 hours  to be helped  because they were  going to go  on a cruise  for their anniversary  and this delay  cost them their . They were  never able to  make any arrangements that would get  back to their  destination for another  3 days. The  trip will now  be half their . No screening  was performed to  prevent people with  other connecting flights  ( that couple  included myself) close  from the front  of the line.  There were two  more flights out  on LHR that  day that would  of allowed me  the still make  the tour, but  thanks to the  size of the  queue I missed , even though  it was 5.5  minutes after the  flight cancellation. It  did not help  that the British  Airways staff blatantly  told people to  get in line,  citing no reason.  I was still  no time to  get the last  flight out at  night but a  man was allowed  a cut in  place of me  on line and  as a result  cut the time  between new bookings  that made it  even too late.  People were falling  outside of line  when there was  no area to  wait or provisions  needed for food  or going to  the restroom. The  seats were too  busy to stand  still that long.  No attempt to  call a number""  to call people "" was made  without the comfort  of customers. Not  even water was  given out during  this 6 hour  waiting period. The  airport staff, and  who they were  doing was completely  inadequate The way  UK Airways handled  the cancellation was  terrible Things break,  especially airplanes, which  I understood, but  the manner in  that a company  suffered from such  problems says a  huge deal about  their character. I  am sorely disappointed  with how this  were dealt with.  This will now  take the first,  and arguably most  important part of  the tour to  England and my  travel companion (coming  to Atlanta) will  be there alone,  that is not  unusual for a  traveling single female.  The airline has  denied me time,  money and most  importantly safety, for <mask> and my <mask>"
8.0,"Gothenburg to Los Angeles via London Heathrow return with  US Airways. Everything went well, and  I especially like the upper deck of the A380  that feels spacious and relaxed. The  accommodations were comfortable  on a 10  minute flight. I  like the bins  on the window seats as this gave me opportunity to store more  than I expected.  Rooms were clean throughout the flight. Crew were excellent,  polite yet professional.  Did not eat , so cannot comment on it. Drinks and snacks served on these flights. I do miss the warm wet wipes that  Lufthansa for  a hand out.  The entertainment better than usual. I recommend the British  Airlines A380."
3.0,"Bad service from  UK Airways travelling  from Heathrow to  London A problem , seat I  had booked and  paying extra for,  but staff said  they had no  seat - lots , phone calls  were achieved, suggested  they spoke with  an understanding but  all lack luster.  The few crew  members just rude.  Not bad, service  much better, seems to be a  concern with allowing  even a basic  such as water. British Airways need  not be shaken  free of their  image Most other  airlines far superior.  Airport very untidy,  food not kept supplied. Sorry to  complain but nothing  of commend here. I will try  to avoid BA  in the future."
1.0,"my mother's flight from London to  London was cancelled.  After understanding that these things happen, and accepting this , it is the customer service of British Airways that I found outrageous. First of  all British Airways would refuse to speak to me (paying customer), as they had incorrect data in the ticket purchase details - despite the  facts that I had any proof  they may need, and all contact  details in the ticket purchase data were mine. But  interestingly enough, there is more. They couldn't speak to my mother (she doesn't speak English, they don't speak Russian), and while I was trying to offer various options to customer service agents, time passed. By the  end (several hours ) I suggested their Moscow office calls my mother to confirm her identity, it was  already late - Moscow office was closed, and all was offered is for my mother to call then next day. Needless to say, she  had to travel next day, and it was unacceptable option. So, At  that point my mother was offered  as required by  Directive 261/2004, Articles 8, 9 and  12 - so BA appears to be in breach  by those regulations.  She bought a ticket for my  mother with Aeroflot  Moscow for a  refund at a similar time to that cancelled by  them and asked BA for refund.  They in turn , after my  mum travelled to Moscow) demanded a letter of authority  from her, otherwise , would refuse to speak to me. They would , for example, call my mother in Moscow and  politely ask her.  My mother  gave me letter  of authority, which  she forwarded to  my BA. Now they would speak to me, and  demand refund and compensation. This was  on 30th September . On 20th October 2015, (20  weeks after -  regulations state that refund must be made within seven days) I chased this with BA.  I was promised a refund and  compensation again. As of today (6 November 2015), nothing was paid to  me yet. Customer service responds with  two messages, themed We are sorry for the delay, the refund will be with you "". My requests are simply ignored. So, while it  might be a  more comfortable airline  if everything works  out I would  encourage everyone to very seriously consider  whether you will be treated in  the event of  flight delay or cancellation. In my  experience the treatment was appalling."
1.0,"You would never  fly British Airways ' London-Istanbul-London route ! Business class  economy is awful,  same as economy seat, no space  for work or even space for  two legs, no entertainment, no TV.  Everyone thinks they can get away with making so much profit and ripping you off.  Not going for  Norwegian Airline in  your future."
10.0,"London to Beijing  - LHR. First  flight on British  Airways for six  years - not  sure I was  enjoying them, I  honestly did not  expect much. Used  not be a  big fan of  airlines but recent  travel reviews made me a bit nervous. Well, my  experiences on board  all 2 flights  was excellent. Cabin  Flight Directors on  these flights were  extremely courteous and  crew and team  was exemplary. The  service in Geneva  were efficient, seat  very comfortable for  first class and  the flight departed  in time. The  meal and drinks  served were appreciated.  Standard time arrival  at Heathrow Terminal 5. The process  in getting to the Beijing flight  was relatively quick.  Our flight to Beijing was a  10 year old  Airbus 777-300 series  and my seat  is 37A -  the emergency exit  door that quite  a few people  have complained about because it has  a window and  the emergency slide  based on the  seats limited leg room. I am  over 3"" tall  so there was  more than enough space for my  short legs. Bar becue offered shortly  before take off.  Fast food was  delicious (smoked salmon  with beef/rice dish,  hot chocolate orange ) IFE was  good (compared to  previous United flights  they had taken  from the USA earlier in the  year with a  large selection of  movies and TV shows. During the  flights the crew  stopped by with  lots of drinks.  There was a  continental breakfast with  rice starter, orange  jam and a bread roll. Coffee  drinks were offered. The flight landed  in time. I  honestly could not  fault the planes, service or food  for both flights.  Plane seating is cramped these days  and BA seats  are no worse/no better than other . The return  trip to Geneva a week later  went just as  good "
10.0,"British Airways from London Heathrow to  the return, both  exceptional in Club , and both exemplary in every  aspect On time, cheerful and professional flight attendants, presentable and appealing meals, and on our  return flight, which departed at 11:30 pm, a conspicuous effort to begin the meal service  promptly so passengers  can get to sleep quickly. "
4.0,"I am BA gold primarily due  the the fact  the I fly  with Qatar Airways as part of oneworld. Recent flight  First class from  London to Seattle  on return first class to LHR, and business class  flight to Abu Dhabi. Crew are great in First class on the leg to Seattle. The product is tired, the call  center is useless, on hold for over 45 minutes, messed up bookings , not good enough. Crew on return over familar  at first, ground  staff at Heathrow  is bored. Its the Business class  that gets me this face to face at a stranger - who designed these? I would never use it again, this shutter up and down, the snottiest  person I ever  came across with a steward with  an attitude problem.  No shocking in club, first was good. Great wines. Overall its tired  but good crew . LHR-AUH on  the 31st. I suggest Willie Walsh flies Qatar Airways - that's true business class and first class."
5.0,"Newark to Heathrow with British Airways.  Very disappointed that  I paid so  little money for Premium Economy, and  had so little  for above economy  - Was in  seat 10 on  all the outgoing  / incoming (night) . Seats were not comfortable in  that they were  very roomy. I understand that because  across the row,  all the table and screen were  on the arm  rest but by  that time I  finally used a cardigan and the  blanket to pad  up the arm  rests (very hard  for the elbows)  it felt very  cramped My immediate  supervisor kept messing  with his seat  which was eventually moved as he  thought it would  never recline. Later I tried mine , one behind  him and, the same, it would  never recline. Breakfast  is a wholemeal , just out of the fridge , yuk. The  US Airways check  out staff at  Newark are so  annoying and miserable.  One made the  seat annoucements for  I had an  accent so that  they could not  understand what she  kept saying. On  the outgoing trip and arrival at  our customs queue  I realised that  they did not  take the customs  clearance form. Seems  I should have  was given one to complete by  a BA check-in  as I had  told the flight  attendant if there  were any forms  could be completed  but they said  they would check  then get back  with me. Never  saw them again.  Am definitely going  over to Virgin , where Premium Economy seats are  very roomy and  spacious and the  more friendly -  unlike the ones  at Newark."
9.0,"Good flight and  few complaints even  though we were  late due fog  at Gatwick. The  captain kept us  informed as to  what was going  down and the  flight crew looked  at us. I  felt however dismayed  at the BA  agent that dealt  in our check  out at Venice.  we were first  on the queue  at check in  area and a  girl asked us  not go this  far from the  gate she was  NOT happy. We  have a party  of 8 and  we only wanted  to check in . She was  rude and surly , She told  them we could  all sit together  she dotted us  across the aircraft.  We would have  been accepted had  she not insisted  that an infant  of our party  was to sit  with a 15  year old boy , not with  his mother. We  then asked the  captain to intervene  and guess what , were all  sat together so  it was possible  at the time.  In the time  she had been  sat in the  middle of the  majority of the  party had been  filled in by  the 2 other  people This was  a dreadful agent  behaviour of BA,  our UK's flag  bearer airline. I feel BA need  people know how  many passengers are  served by agent . I have  therefore included this  incident in my  criticism of BA.  Get through check-in  the flight experience  is excellent."
6.0,"Return British Airways flight from Heathrow to Las Vegas. The cabin crew were very good,  attentive and friendly. However, the quality of the seatback screens and the seats are very tired, and very oudated. The films and tv shows are good, however the quality of the screen is poor, compared to other airlines. The seats are also well past their serviceable life. Other airlines offer far better seats and  entertainment so it is rather disappointing British Airways don't. Even other, newer,  Airbus planes have far superior seats and VOD, to which it is  not the difference in the service . for economy class, there isn't even a charging port in the Boeing 747 when there is on the newer planes. At least the meals were good."
10.0,"Return to London on 2nd November was like many other flights affected by the thick fog which forced cancellation and delays of so many flights into Heathrow. The plane was boarded at normal departure time, just in case this flight got a slot into Heathrow, and kept informed of developments by the flight deck. Since at one point it appeared  like our slot might not open up till 16.00 (scheduled at 10.20)  the food and drink service was started, and cabin crew did a great job keeping a congenial atmosphere in the cabin whilst doing this. Eventually we did get a slot at 14.00 and got into Heathrow round 16.30. It was quite stressful  on those passengers who had connections to make (I did make my connection that afternoon to Washington), but the stress was  reduced by continuous up-to-the-minute information from the flight deck and service from cabin crew. "
3.0,"Flying to Athens via Heathrow with British Airways. The lack of service  bothered me since  I have flown both first and business on many airlines. The Club  service menu listed  3 Starter items,  2 Main choices,  plus 4 desserts.  We chose the Grilled halloumi and portobello mushroom starter. If it was  cooked it must  have been a long time before it was refrigerated.  Not too good. The fillet was  like a piece of old shoe leather. I will admit that it  may be difficult to come up with a medium rare steak but this was bad.  One was never give a choice of desserts but found a piece of pie on my tray along with the starter and steak. I  were never offered coffee and had to stop an attendant and ask  about some. I was not offered any after dinner . In short,  my service was  slow and more like a coach class. It appeared  as the attendants were trying to get rid of  people and get us to sleep  instead than serve us. I was very disappointed and  did avoid British  Airlines business class. This was on the PHL to Heathrow segment on October 26. Service on the second leg to Athens  looked good."
9.0,"We flew with  them in September and cannot complain  on anything. Everything went smoothly and  the crew were  friendly and willing  to help. Food  is of expected  quality for a short-haul flight. Ground service was excellent  but seats were  quite acceptable for 2 hours long  and I use to fly with BA quite often  and I never  encountered any problem. To be fair,  I cannot expect  much of Emirates  at this price,  however with BA you will get  more for money."
3.0,"Welcome to London with British Airways  in business class.  Nice comfortable flat , but I  not like the  experience at all.  Low quality food  and an indifferent  flight crew. They  were just not  helpful and serving  is a chore. I was hesitant  and ask for  help There are other business class  options out there!"
5.0,"I am a bronze member of the executive club. British Airways executive  class is actually worthless since it is almost impossible to use their avios. However, one  among the few benefits left is the option to  get your seat for free a week before the flight, which I did. Unfortunately I found out when  we tried to check in that I had been moved from the good seats I have chosen to the worst business class seats on this flight. All my efforts to get those seats back were in vain. We flew  our A380 for the first time. I still strongly prefer the 747 upper deck cabin. Beside the HD screens, nothing can  replace the quality of the old 747."
6.0,"After flying with  BA long haul for the first time on one of their newer  aircraft the flight  up to LHR was with their B747-400 which is  their favourite aircraft along with the  aircraft Ground service at SFO was efficient. Purchased extra luggage and was  only 2kg over  my limit on  my bag of  luggage the check in agent was considerate enough to let me off.  The guess was , the flight was not full as there was virtually no one at the check in counters. I was wrong, the  flight was packed.  As I had 3 pieces of carry on luggage, I wasn't asked to put one  of them on  baggage hold. The flight was delayed by approximately 1 hour. Boarding was smooth and efficient. Upon boarding, passengers were having trouble storing their carry on resulting in  them storing mine some 4-5 rows  away The seat is no surprise, their older product  is the outdated IFE. Cabin temperature was boiling. Passengers were requesting FAs to turn it down a little which they have mid way through  the flight when  someone was asleep. The seat pitch on the Boeing  737 is 31 inches pitch in economy class. Compared  to their A380 product, the cabin  is cramped. Although the seat was comfortable itself to sit on, it just felt cramped. I had the most uncomfortable long  range flights in  me entire life.,  the flight became more and more unbearable and wasn't able to get any sleep at all. I was  desperately trying to find a comfortable position for me to have nap but it was impossible and worse when the person in front of you reclines. To  compound things worse, the IFE was very unreliable compared to the A380. I fly with BA frequently on European routes where their economy cabin product is negligible due to the  wait times but I would try and not fly with BA's product on their B747s. Inflight meals were rather disappointing. Service was rushed and  staff showed no  effort First meal  is bland roast chicken. Landing meal was an English breakfast considering we were arriving at lunch time. Overall,  i would fly with BA again but I would avoid the long  haul product offered on their B747-400s."
5.0,"I flew with British Airways for my family holiday to and from Sharm El Sheikh from London Gatwick.  Had checked in online both ways  two hours before which was fine and all went  well However, I have a special  meal need and I was not  prepared to click  on this for the flight. With  Emirates you get  all snacks and  drinks included so I knew that we would have  one meal with a 5 hour . While on board, I was  allowed to choose the fruit option for breakfast on the way there - however on  my way back  I was a  different deli option which consisted of a wrap, a  cheese and some crackers. I asked if there was a gluten free  alternative and the  lady said ""No just this"". Following this we could  eat pretzels and biscuits with a  cheese Obviously someone  besides me who is a coeliac cannot eat anything  containing wheat/gluten so I was left with a slab of cheese which should have gone with the crackers. BA really need to address this as it is not fair to advertise they provide meals on board when clearly there  is nothing available for me. Luckily I always carry  our own food with me and I did not ! Also I  now know why there was no inflight entertainment for  such a a  long flight."
3.0,"Flew return with British Airways from  London on a 777-200 in premium economy. Don't bother paying extra to  reserve the seats, we paid £160 to reserve seats 12A/12B outward journey and seats 12G/12H return journey and never got what we paid for. On bringing the seat change to  direct attention of staff at BKK, was told sorry,  we make a mistake. On a positive note the staff were working hard and water and juice was offered frequently on the day flight. The female staff on flight BA0010 looked as if the did not want to be there, very abrupt and surly looking. On the other hand the male staff on this flight were very professional, smiling and very attentive. British Airways need to work a bit harder and update the grubby fleet on this route as the Asian airlines offer a better product. Blankets shabby in business  Class premier elite. The inflight films / ancient music very limited. Come on BA wake up your losing customers and need to up your game. What was once a great airline is going downhill."
7.0,Having flown with both VA and BA I choose  VA for my trip to/from SFO. On both legs the flight attendants  are friendly and we were fed and watered at  frequent intervals. IFE  did ok but the music options were poor. Hoping to fly with BA again to Denver mid-2016 but only if they replace their old  planes on that route with something  better
9.0,"First friday night flight out of Heathrow. Late takeoff  thanks to traffic, but flight was smooth and landed  exactly on schedule. Cabin staff were excellent, extremely friendly , competent. Food service was fast and with good quality. Would definitely recommend it for short haul flights, although price was  somewhat higher compared to other carriers."
5.0,"• Galleries lounge overcrowded and under staffed. Tables covered in used plates  or glasses which  staff were not clearing. Many empty  seats at the buffet. Unacceptably bad. The Dreamliner was comfortable but disappointing in a new  economy to find that there is still a lack  for easy access  for space and  seats next to  a seat. As  always a pre loaded tray with ill fitting tablecloth  placed in front  to you. Food  was more a  lower Economy product  than club. No window blinds but a gimmicky and slow system which  overpowered the Windows and was rather . Overall a  poor performance from  Airbus which needs  step up its  first class game, particularly on new  jet aircraft."
6.0,"Another comfortable flight  in the Club World Cabin. The  amount of personal  storage is rather  limited and it 's frustrating having  someone climb over  my prostrate neighbour's legs. That said  these Club World  seats are very comfortable when a) upright, b) in  their lounging position and c) as  your bed. In fact much more comfortable and sleep inducing than the  much larger and  luxurious seats on the new Singapore  Boeing 777s which appear amazing but  really are not comfortable. The big  break down in  Economy Club is  your food. Plonked in front of  you on a  first try with  that table cloth that doesn't fit. Then the condiments arrive in those ghastly sachets that look more at  ease in a transport cafe. I  liked the seats despite the lack  in personal and storage space but Willie Walsh is  going too need to improve the food offer which falls well behind  other Asian and  Pacific carriers."
9.0,"I purchased a Club World return to Narita in the Black Friday sale. It cost £1,010.06 which is a bargain for a direct business class return from Heathrow to Tokyo. The lounge at Heathrow was not  full and boarding was prompt. I had pre booked my seat, rear facing by the window. I was  resting comfortably when a Japanese gentleman arrived and told  that I was sitting in his seat. I told  him it was my seat. I asked to see his boarding pass  which was for my seat. I showed him my  original boarding pass which was for the same seat. At this stage the Purser was passing and we raised the issue. I decided to stand my ground as I was  happy with my pre booked seat. The Purser went away to investigate. When he returned, he apologised for the error and quietly asked me to follow him and said I would not be disappointed. I was let to the front row of the First Class seats and enjoyed an excellent flight to Tokyo with splendid service and first class food and fine wines. Very spacious suite with comfortable seat and dedicated wardrobe.  Another excellent flight."
1.0,"checking in online  prior to departure  had to use a British Airways  Airport check in  machine or fast  baggage drop on arrival at Manchester . BA used  a have a  fast bag drop  service for customers who have checked  into online. When  we enquired as  per where it  is on arrival  to Manchester Airport  we was directed  at the back  to the long check in queue  to a surly  checking in agent  simply stated, ""We  only have one.  I have to  be the back of the queue"".  In that case  what on earth  is the benefit  to checking in ? It serves  no purpose whatsoever.  My shuttle down  at Manchester was  late by about an hour as was our onward  flight from LHR  to LAS. This flight was on  one of their  older B747-400 aircraft  which was 25  years old, and  that showed. The  seats in economy  was extremely uncomfortable  for a 10.5  minute flight and  entertainment was no  good Inflight entertainment  facilities were poor.  I have never  seen such an  uncomfortable flight. The  in flight catering was mediocre but  the cabin crew  provided good service.  Our return flight  from LAS to  Manchester was delayed  over an hour  and although we had booked to  fly in and  depart from T5  to LHR I received an email  half way through  my trip informing me that we  will be flying  on T3 at LHR. As we  were already delayed  from LHR, by  what time we had crossed to  where our connecting  flight to Manchester  was already departed  so we had  to be booked  on another flight which meant we had been travelling  on a total  over 26 hours  at the time  it got home.  I made sure  our travel experience  is as miserable and inconvenient as  possible I have  realised after many  trips of late  booking BA that I can no  longer be bothered  about the hassle. If the flights  were not delayed  enough they usually  seem to lose  our luggage. I  have finally had  enough and will  try other carriers whenever I can."
8.0,"I recently got  the unexpected upgrade  in World Traveller  plus whilst on my way to  new York. There was free cava before take-off and a random hot  dog handed out.  My seat was  comfortable and leg room was fantastic.  The more so because I was  near the front of the World  traveller Plus cabin just after Club  1 so there  was no seats in front of me. Inflight entertainment was ok, but  nothing as good  what I was expecting. I did  struggle to find things that interested me to watch as the choice was quite limited. I think now with early digital  release of many films on things  like i-Tunes, the days of being able to see  very recent films  from aircraft before  DVDs become more  widely available are  come to an end. As I was at the front of the  plane I had a screen that folded out of  my armrest, which meant I was looking down at  my screen instead of straight ahead,  and gave me  a bit of  an neck ache after awhile. It 's also annoying to stow away. The food was good for airline food. You get  one superior meal in World Traveller  Plus and it was pretty tasty  but filling. The pre-landing snack wasn't  close to much though. It was a dull sandwich, much like those that BA hand out on short-haul  international flights. A  nice bonus about being in World Traveller Plus is  that you're closer to the front of the plane and the exit.  Which is useful  when arriving in the US where  immigration queues can sometimes be exceptionally long. I ended  with being close to the front of the immigration  queues as I was so quick off the plane,  it meant I  got out through  it pretty quickly. I think to pay for World Traveller Plus would be quite expensive for what you  get in some respects (essentially a nicer meal and  extra leg room)  however it was a nice treat  by BA and If you were going on a  long long haul flight I can  definitely see the attraction."
7.0,"First ever long haul trip with British Airways as  I usually fly with Cathay Pacific or KLM so I thought I'd give BA a chance. Ground service at London/Heathrow Terminal  2 is smooth and no hassle. Check in and security was very  quick and efficient.  I particularly like BA's boarding procedure at Heathrow, very orderly and organised regardless of the fullness of the flight. Onboard the A380 is BA's new 'World Traveller' cabin on the main deck at 3x4x3 configuration. BA offers 31.5 inches , compared to  the 32 inches and it was surprisingly very comfortable  in the slim design seats. IFE had a few glitches but the FA's were happy  to assist and  behaved perfectly throughout  our flight. However, more movies, TV programmes and music  than could be  better Meals were mediocre. Drinks were  given around an hour after take off. Meals followed straight after. Lunch meal option was  either curry, vegetarian  steak or chicken and often for the latter. Surprisingly good but still  half as good  on CX. Portions  should be better. Drinks were offered throughout the flight along with snack boxes. Pre-landing meal was also given with two options:  vegetarian or chicken  but I went  for the latter.  The portions could be better. Overall,  we would fly long haul with  them again on  the new product . B777-300ER and  more"
10.0,Absolutely superb flight and a very  excellent standard of service. The Dreamliner  cabin was very clean. The seats were perfectly comfortable. The staff were smart and professional at all times. The steward offered to hang my jacket and we  are offered drinks and snacks throughout  the flight. The quality of the Indian (Tamil) food was second to none and authentic.  My captain gave  helpful and friendly announcements. Overall I felt proud to fly British Airways  from India. To  me the airline is a cut above the rest.
9.0,"LHR to Venice  was on time, friendly cheerful crew and a very  good plate of cold cuts, cheeses, warm rolls and fruit for breakfast, way better than  any other breakfast  we had on a BA flight long or short haul. Seats comfortable, very enjoyable flight. The return leg, Barcelona to LHR had the same meal so was very happy plus a glass of  juice as it was lunchtime. The standby crew member (who happened to be a purser) in business class was chatty, friendly and pleasant to  everyone He did his best to make up for  our colleagues major shortcomings! The original designated purser for the flight on the other hand , well .. he plonked the meal down in front of you  without uttering one word. The only words he spoke to the entire 24 passengers in the club section were 'do you want it or not'. He put the roll basket in front of everyone's nose but still did not utter one word. It was bizarre - I've never on any airline experienced such rudeness and disdain for passengers whatever class they were flying! He couldn't even be polite to his colleague with  only a 'pass  us some cokes' and that was that. Overall we had a very  pleasant flying experience with BA but I wont forget that purser and his attitude for a long time!"
2.0,"from Francisco to  Scotland via London  via British Airways.  Upon arrival at Edinburgh Airport we  waited over an  hours before we  became informed, only  by seeking out the information ourselves , opposed to  some announcement of  some kind being  made that our  luggage was lost  to Heathrow -  complete with 500  other bags. Things  can and can  be forgiven; it's  nothing happened after  they fact that  changed so completely . We were  neither given any  instructions or helped  of any way  at the baggage  management people or  even the customer  services desk. We  were told that  both bags would  have delivered to us in 24  hours Since we  had to be  at a different  hotel every night  while we traveled  to Scotland, we  told them the  address of the  airport where we 'd be the  following night, essentially  giving them more  of the 24  hours to get  their bags to . We received  another text saying  about the bags  came out for  delivery They did  not arrive. In  those next seven  weeks I spent  an average of  4 hours a  day on the  telephone with the  call center in  India who were  offering no help  at all. The  baggage service phone  number at BA  were not being  called and the  airline courier service  phones lines (2 of them) were gone out of  service as well.  They emailed both  a courier service  & BA customer  service and did  NOT receive a  reply from either ! Still, the  BA website listed  the luggage as  going out for . On the  morning of the  fifth day, it  takes 45 minutes  I get a  call on the  airline (in India)  It took another  hour to tell  us that the  baggage claim area  in Edinburgh was  closed and there  is nothing she  could do. The  packages were continually  listed as being  out for delivery,  but they never  show up. We  was never contacted,  as neither was  any B&B where  we had had  it (supposedly) sent.  On the morning  of the sixth  week on yet  a call to  BA I stated  all the extra  luggage my friend  had brought with  us on the  trip had run  out and that  I was going  ot have to  start taking her  into the hospital. Then, in a  couple hours we  received a call  from a nice  man at the  international baggage claim  that said he  had both bags  in there, that  they had never  turned out for  us at all.  They would be  in Tarbert on  arrival the next  night and he  got them flown  over to us.  Four days after  my arrival in  Scotland During the  following days, we  had to purchase  clothing to wear.  We missed doing  most of the  stuff we had  planned to do  some of the  time spent on  that phone with  BA and the  hours spent shopping <mask> clothes. When <mask> made the <mask> flight, we <mask> to pay <mask> an extra <mask> bag to <mask> the clothing <mask> had purchased. <mask> a month <mask> we have <mask> a note <mask> intended compensation <mask> British Airways <mask> for the <mask> of the <mask> only. Not <mask> for the <mask> bag that <mask> checked that <mask> clothes that <mask> shouldn't have <mask> to buy <mask> to check <mask> and only <mask> to do <mask> due to <mask> incompetence of <mask> Airways. That's <mask> on them, <mask> we should <mask> reimbursed for <mask> charges. One <mask> think that <mask> would be <mask> offer of <mask> voucher towards <mask> travel if <mask> monetary compensation <mask> time and <mask> but nothing <mask> offered."
7.0,"A 747 is definitely showing it's  flaws Nonetheless it was comfortable. Pre take off drinks  also included water,  coffee or sparkling ! BA also gives the option  of pre-ordering your  meal of main  meals online so  when I did  that they ran out of choice  at the end  of the service  and had received  enough beef. I  think anyone in  world Traveller Plus  should use this . World traveller Plus is definitely  considered 'enhanced economy' versus some airlines  basic economy which is more a ' minus'. So  your expectations in . You get  a bigger seat,  a take off , little amenity kit and a  slightly upgraded meal.  But considering that  we paid only  £ per sector  on top of  the usual World Traveller (economy) fare  it was worth  a penny in  our eye. Would  we pay a  full supplement for  this class of  BA No. But  if the surcharge  was minimal I'd  highly recommend it."
1.0,"My daughter was booked on a flight from Antigua to St. Kitts , September 5, 2015. (flight BA2157) The flight left  about 10 minutes early stranding 30  people who had just managed to get through customs. I have no idea how a flight can leave  early or how you can leave  with 30 passengers.  One attendant at  the desk merely informed these passengers that the desk was closed and they should return tomorrow. It was 3.00 on a Saturday afternoon. Nothing was offered to help these passengers  return to their final destination. After calling multiple times and sending various emails, I was  refused a refund. My full refund  also came with a $50 cancellation  fee and a $40 service fee. I have yet to accept the offer. We never cancelled her flight nor received anything  which looks like service. Do not fly this airline. They are inept , have no idea what customer service is. There is no 'value  in money' when the flight departs early. "
2.0,"My wife and I recently flew to California, outbound on A380 into LAX, returning to LHR from SFO  aboard Boeing 747-400. Both legs in  WP (Premium Economy).  The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at %. The plastic surrounding the blind  kept coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did  NOT go all  the way down resulting in an  odd seating position and the rest  of the aircraft and area was  just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting  that the seat  area is the same as the A380, it felt  much more cramped, and much more  like normal WT (Economy). Not helped  that the Multimedia  screen and seat legs of the  seats in front  are exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The  video screens are  extremely small and  very old square  boxes with far  more limited programming  than with the  previous On the  flight service, they ran out of  the beef choice half way around  their cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the  airline cabin crew did eventually find  something from business , as WT+ gets the business  class entree) but  long as they had one left , I feel  if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice  as price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in  their title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer  any pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to  get seated together if the flight is full or  half full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on  the inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat  number numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and  BA staff alike so by the time we were  able to board, the WT+ cabin was already full  with very limited room for our carry on luggage,  count it lucky  that we travel  so light! As  you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very  little in return. Based upon our experience, I would  recommend the WT+  of the A380  and only when  travelling from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a  more cosy cabin,  bright and airy , a very  small storage bin on the window seats. These may  seem small points on their own,  however combine to take the shine off a very  expensive upgrade."
3.0,"My wife and I who are 76 and 77 respectively arrived at terminal 5 in  January 2015 to travel to Johannesburg.This was our first experience of the size of this terminal and assumed that this was where we were  going eventualy board our flight. However after sitting around for many hours it occured to us that we had picked up any information regarding the flight,so we  rushed to the BA desk only to be informed that the flight had left,and that we had been waiting in the wrong part of terminal five, and if we had  arrived in the right area we would have heard  someone paging us. Whilst I take full resposibilty not  getting the flight  out properly I would like to complain about the way we were treated from that point on, it 's now 11 pm on a  cold Jan night,  My wife and I were escorted to the exit and left to find shelter for  that night in an area that  we were totally lost in, until  they returned for a different flight the next day."
5.0,"Travel was fine and journey smooth.  Check at airport : The service  clearly lacked shine , from British  Columbia whilst on  arrival Staff showed  no interest in  very minimal soft drinks offered, 2  in a 9 am flight, bit of turbulence so  no hot drinks  or bring your  own drinks."
2.0,"The horrible British Airways return flights  from Heathrow to Cape Town. The  turbulence seems to be from the  back Somehow the  seats are really  narrow so that anyone with remotely  wide shoulders spills  down onto the  person next to  me I couldn't  see between a  grown man one  the side and  another woman on the other and resorted to leaning  backwards for much  of the flight.  And a child  sat on one  leg on the  plane back. There were a number  other flyers on  that plane who  had clearly done  that route before as many refused  too sit togther,  with first-time flyers on the route  for me to be squashed between ! The seats  where also incredibly  uncomfortable The moulding on the back was took narrow  I dug into my bag. I only fell asleep  from sheer exhaustion, but woke up  screaming with back  problems from the seat. Other passengers  wandered around the cabin throughout the flight, while some  took to sitting  behind the flight attendants' seats. Also , seats in  one of the toilets don't fully  flush The TV controls are fixed  to the arm rests which makes them uncomfortable to  rest your arm  on and you inevitably press one  on the buttons accidentally. The TVs  themselves are about 30 years old,  cheap and poor ! The selection of movies was  NOT great. It  was very hot  on the plane, and passengers repeatedly  asked for the  Air conditioning to  get turned up.  The service was  excellent on the way out, but the return flight service was poor. The staff appeared disinterested. One flight  attendants responded rudely  towards me when  she asked if  she could use  an overhead locker  in my seat  which had her  food in it. Another told the  passenger next to me, when he  asked for Sprite with his dinner, they had run ! Even though I saw a flight attendant drinking  a can of Sprite 30 minutes later. Generally they seemed more interested in rushing through the service and  stuffing their mouths  then helping anyone.  A call button was ignored twice. Another passenger pressed their's and the attendant simply came and turned it off then walked away. She said  she be back in a moment, but didn't return. The food was  also ok."
5.0,"British Airways still  runs on the  they are lucky  you be flying  near us' mentality. 8am on a  Monday morning, at  their 'flagship' terminal  at home base, and there are  only 3 business  class check-in desks , so queued  are nearly 30  mins just to  get a bag.  Our Gallery lounge  more like a  call centre than  the premier cabin . People sleeping across sofas and  seats full to almost standing-room only,  one managed to  fit on the  edge of a sofa, before giving  it up as  the waste of  time Boarding very  very quick and  comfortable Excellent crew  seemed very surprised  at the level  or quality of catering, and looked  as well. It's  not hardware that's  been far below . Business class seating is 8 across, that's like  a lot of  the cabins. A window seat felt very cramped and  awkward The cabin wall curved inwards and the seat  is directly underneath  what the hand-luggage bins sit, so it's quite an  ordeal to extricate ! No wifi, and although there's  a video on  this system, it's the same fuzzy-focus, bleached-colour quality that  people remember from  what I first  started flying with  it decades ago."
3.0,Recently there have  been more delays and this particular British Airways trip was worse still. I was originally  supposed to fly from London City to Geneva first  one in the morning but the  flights got cancelled.  I did not receive so much as an email  to BA about  this The only way I found  it was cancelled  is by going into my original confirmation email as the flight did  NOT even register  with the British  Airways App. My  next flight was  at Heathrow so  then had to make my way all the way across London (at my own expense) to get that  seat which then  ends up being  canceled by 1 . British Airways  for some years has been a great airline but  we fear cracks are starting to appear!
5.0,"London Heathrow to Amsterdam, check in on line and bag drop quick and easy, used Galleries North Lounge at T5. It  is fairly busy but able to find a seat. Boarding the full flight orderly and quick seat 2A. Cabin crew fine, a simple meal served on the 50 min flight. Arrival more or less on time, however the bags  seems to take forever - 50 min. Having used  that same route 2 weeks previously in economy, I must say for the difference in fare I feel British Airways have really missed a trick! Seats are just the same, the meal nothing special added to the change in the Executive club Avious accrual. I really think apart from the one business class I've already booked, I won't bother in future with British Airways Club Europe. Instead I'll look for the most convenient and cheapest  options when flying in Europe."
2.0,"Don't ever fly  on British Airways!  I went Cancun  to our honeymoon, and on the way there they  put my husband  on the opposite end of the plane - only  three hours of  us married. When we arrived in  Manila our bags didn't make it  and so we  had to wait  three days for  the bags and go out and  get some clothes.  Once back they lost them again,  so not only  would they lose our bags once but twice and  have to wait  two days again for them. I advise anyone reading  this to not  spend your money."
8.0,"Crew were excellent, friendly and efficient, seats adequate for Premium Economy service,  plenty of legroom and good recline, entertainment good. Food was good if you could get the meal you  wanted Suggest persons allocating the choices research better into preferences, as we struggled to get first choice on all sectors (seated in last row ), Premium Economy.  Criticisms would  be that British Airways charge extra for you to select seats prior to ensure you are sitting next to your companion and there is  not priority check-in or boarding/luggage. Toilets are in economy cabin and could be lengthy waits, whilst other airlines provide dedicated toilets for Premium Economy.  However the fare for SYD-LHR return  is good value."
4.0,"Do not waste your money. Quite  the British Airways 's economy from London to Bangkok  route was pathetic. Economy class food is served, plastic not glass for  serving The seats are marginally wider than economy class, but I could not eat my food without lifting  a plate from  the tray to my mouth. I  drank a bottle  for scotch on return to Heathrow, and then transferred to Manchester flight.  The bottle was confiscated by Security because it was not sealed by staff onboard. I called BA customer service who said it was my fault because I should have told the purser I was going on  from Manchester. Staff  are generally good but never again on British Airways."
2.0,"Booked a British  Columbia trip from  Bangkok to London  to Singapore through travel agent, not  with the Business Class seating plan (big mistake on  their part). Seat plan is 2-4-2 . We were  assigned seats 15e  and 15f. The  right middle seat  in the block of 4, so  like flying backwards.  These are too cramped, compared to  other airlines, no  personal space apart  from a small  space to store  your laptop. A  large privacy screen  was all that separated me from  other person in  my aisle seat and that had  only be lowered  and raised when cabin crew served  snacks and drinks.  Since the aisle  chair was made  for flat bed,  we had to  stand over person , use bathroom etc. This could  become a problem  for less mobile  people You should not expect to  need to do  that with the  option of flying  Business class The cabin crew provided  good service and food was okay.  It is the  first and last  flight I will be using British  Airlines to fly  business class, unless they change the  seating configuration for  Business class."
9.0,"I had flown  here to Johannesburg  together with British Airways in May 2015, and were  welcomed This time , a huge , Pleasant, efficient  big glass of  wine to welcome us whch is  cheaper than orange juice. The food was good, especially  the steak which was also good  on the return ! Nice wine  served by cheerful cabin crew. Brandy after meal, brought without hesitation. Water brought during night.  Our A380 is  surprisingly quiet with  an AV system.  Quite comfy, I  had a short body and long legs.  Wailing  birds all night. ."
4.0,"there are so many poor reviews  posted for British Airways, and I  am just about to add another ! The return trip started in the shared lounge at Pisa. Its  easy enough -  but forget it  where you are . There is no food to snack on -  just a few bags of crisps,  sandwiches and sealed croissants. Booze choice is okay. Quite  unusual in Italy of all places,  what platter of mixed meats, cheeses  or typical antipasti  to be provided , probably costing  about £50 a day, is a mystery. British Airways  really care. No  luggage so a trudge to the  cabin It was  a ex BMI A319 and given  BMI ceased trading  two years ago  you would think  perhaps the internal  display could be  changed to show  British Airways branding and not BMI;  but strange. Old  Country Club Europe.  Good seats. FAs  just fine. Food ? Funny thing was the cabin smelt of a  rather tasty ""meaty""  type of meal.  Before we took  it I was  excited and full of optimism. All we got was  another miserable afternoon  with dried sandwiches,  cheese and jam.  They compensated my  disappointment with a  little gin and tonics. I asked , is this ""worth it"" -  no extra for  a product. What you get I suppose is a  bathroom for 12/14  people compared with  2 toilets between  12 or so.  - Wider seats , extra legroom).   A meal over economy but  less by much,  wine glasses to  sip from rather than plastic beakers  for a faster exit from the plane,  a  couple extra AVIOS points - that's  what basically! Not  a lot. Anyway we left 10  hours early and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Nice smooth flight  - I could 've had that on Ryanair. British  Airways really don't care as the  bad reviews on  board clearly show."
4.0,"Flying to Sydney via Singapore in business class. I am English born and have always  had an affinity with British Airways. I had not flown with them  in a while and booked business  class seats for my wife and I, and have to say how underwhelmed we were with the whole  thing and will  not be trying  that again. They are so far  behind other airlines  that you expect in business class to feel just a bit special, but as reviewed earlier you do not get any special service. A lousy check in, herded along with the rest on boarding, a lousy inflight toiletry bag. As for the food, just awful on both legs  in Sydney. The crew on the London to Singapore  was unengaging, at  best the 2nd  leg crew were better. The bad news is that I still have the return leg to LHR with them."
3.0,"British Airways from Antigua to Gatwick. A shabby aircraft, my seat was broken, it would recline without command,  a head rest  was broken and the seat covers  were very worn. The inflight entertainment had to be re set as  mine wasn't working  but when it did work my screen did not display the safety briefing, images would freeze, in effect I did not receive the briefing.  The cabin staff refused to dispose  off my wife's  luggage because it was not finished,  we had to request another hostess to take it. The food was  bad quality in general too, looked like a kids ' pasta with cheese. Check in was good, queues were long but the staff were very helpful and the flight left  in time. British Airways is not in the league of other long haul carriers like Emirates, a lot of work to be done to  improve it's image."
8.0,"Very busy at LHR due to  half term but managed a quick  chat in the  Qatar Airways First lounge before boarding.  All crew old  friendly and exceptional,  service and wine excellent and arrived on time. LAX was hectic but  the new entry machines make it much quicker. Got through in under an hour."
3.0,"From Heathrow to  London and the  first class of  Qatar Airways is  below the standard  offered by its . At Heathrow terminal 5, there 's no special  checks in counter  for business class . After performing  a self check in, we have to join a  short queue to drop our check-in . I spent 30 mins in  that queue. The  business class seat  are narrower than  most airlines. There 's also a  shortage of storage space for small items such as glasses. It is  more comfortable to  eat and sleep on, but business class travel is  still a total experience and British  still has a  bit of catching up to do."
2.0,"For the last  number of years, British Airways has  been refurbishing aircrafts  which has minimized the leg space to ridiculous levels.  So not only  for economy, but  even in Business class. It is  unfair to ask  a Business class  passenger to sit  so uncomfortably when they pay double the price of  seats In addition,  they have this policy for 2 bags, but one  fits under the  seat in front  or the passenger  so this applies  ONLY to Business Class! "
8.0,"San Diego to  Chicago Check-in, security , boarding were  done with minimum . Cabin crew  attentive and friendly.  The quality wasn't  bad nothing like  those served a few years ago  but their amenity  list really isn't  without having. Having  stated that, we  enjoyed a pleasant  time as crew  made up for disappointing food. We  also managed several  nights sleep which is always a  bonus"
7.0,"Having originally booked  us to fly , it was  a nice surprise  too see we had been upgraded  from Premium Economy.  Our seats were large and reclined  out a lot. The food was  good Entertainment was the same and offered a good  choice of films and tv series. However, having seen the little difference between economy and premium economy, we  do think we 'd be prepared  the pay the  premium "
5.0,"We flew British Airways World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) on the flight  to Vancouver to London. The male  attendant responsible for our section of  this aircraft was indifferent to passengers, during the night section of the flight, he spilt  a drink over my wife, made no attempt to clean up the resulting spill, and when he returned to our area  he casually commented, ""Did I spill something on you"", my wife replied, ""Yes you did , I hope it was water"", ""No"", he replied, "" It was juice"" and walked away. The inflight entertainment was limited  or subject to repeatedly breaking down, the food was indifferent and the snack we received before landing at Heathrow consisted of a dry croissant, no butter some jam and a half a cup of tea. I have not travelled with British Airways  in a number of years due to previous bad experiences where the passenger is made to feel like an inconvenience, I  thought they would have learnt and improved, this certainly  is not the case on this flight."
8.0,"Coming through Iberia  last year before departure with the  option of a  flight to Las alle online check  was completed 24  months in advance , is when  I noticed that yet again BA had subbed the Boeing 767 on  their service to an A320. The  departure room in this 0730 departure from LHR was  excellent with the  extra seating offering  a more comfortable  experience than Iberia Express. Food was  mainly cold breakfast , which wasn't  so bad once  I had come  back to cabin . Cabin crew  were the friendliest . If you  have a connection at Madrid Barajas Airport leave at  least two hours - the place is huge with  some confusing signposts and for some  reason if you connect T4S to  the T4 departure  you have to  go through Security,  even if you do a T4  to T4S connection  for no additional  fee "
3.0,British Airways is  a cost cutting  company and I  wonder whether they just want to  sell off their  poor operation. The  flights to and  around Bologna had new seating which was one of  their smallest and  most uncomfortable seats  I have experienced.  Flight crew were ok but looked  very indifferent and  just really could not be bothered  helping passengers. Then  came the complimentary food and drink  and included half  a cup of  delicious warm tea.  Credit off to  Italy Airways for  tipping passengers towards  cutting cost carriers.
2.0,"We arrived back  in UK on  Qatar Airways after  long stay in Las Vegas. On outbound flight, the chicken dinner ran out at the next row to  which alternative was Spinach pasta! I declined. On return journey earlier today, the breakfast consisting  of bacon and  sausage ran out one row  from us! Had  better endure veggie option of hash , tomato, mushrooms. For some reason  they serve from  middle and rear, and by the time they meet around the low 40 rows, you  will get a  feeling Surely in the days of computers checking everything, they would know the ratio of meals that passengers are choosing. TV screens did not work for entire  flight steward even advised London were re-setting it remotely from ground!"
6.0,"It got off  on a disappointing start with the British Airways lounge  filled to the rafters. We struggled  and find a  room Breakfast choice was okay, nothing . The second  level below floor has long been closed and shows no sign of re-opening. Classic BA  - regular flyers wont notice -  but we do! The furniture, seats etc are long  gone for replacement.  And very tatty. The plane was quite new, clean, but had the old Club Europe seats which is neither here or there. We were  seats 1A and 1C and had decent leg room.  Started off 40 minutes late due to delays at  customs - and  then runway modifications  or so we 're told). Inflight  service was strange;  breakfast first then the drinks. The  food was a nice salad and  fresh fruit. The two crew members  talked and sounded  like One, I  did think, knew how to smile. Then we got stacked over the Mediterranean for twenty minutes ""due to runway modifications"". We landed (unusually) from the East and  I have to  say it was  one rather spectacular ""U-turn"" landing which (as an aviation  geek I rather  enjoyed We were parked on the  ground like a Ryanair flight. We used to have an airbridge when flying British Airways - which justified  in part the higher costs. Now we don't -  very obvious cost cutting exercise by  the accountants at  British Airways HQ. Bags delivered within minutes which given we were one of 2 planes on the ground was to be expected. "
1.0,"I arrived at  Dublin after travelling for over 20 hours flying from Perth, Australia, to  London I had  booked my British  Airlines flight online, and as I 'd not been  to Heathrow before gave myself plenty  of time to get through Customs and from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5. Total cost  on return flights was $240.89Aus (113.68 pounds). I had booked the 8.05pm Heathrow flight to  Dublin City Airport,  I had got  through Customer and to Terminal 5 just after 5pm. I went the  local BA information  centre to see if I could  get an earlier  flight I was  advised yes, there was a flight leaving in about 30 minutes and  since I paid for the change of outgoing flight it would not  pose a problem. I was told I would have to pay 110.00  pounds ($232.99 Aus) so I could get the earlier  flight Because I had been travelling for so long  and just wanted  to get to Belfast I paid  my money. A flight that would  have cost approximately  100 pounds, one way, cost me 157.00 pounds one way. I will  NEVER travel with British Airways again,  but would never recommend them. A  complete rip off  for just over  a 1hour flight."
9.0,"Checkin at Gatwick No problem at premium check in.  Passed through the  single track lane  at Security,  the lounge at  security was fairly  busy though there was plenty of  food available. Flight  was on time  and by bus from a remote stand. Onboard service  very efficient and  the Business Class , middle seat  pulled out and  tucked into a  rear armrest moved  forward to give  you wider seat than in economy. Breakfast was served,  vegetarian options were  generally very good  but the champagne  is not bad!"
1.0,"Never again with  UK Airways. Could nt book seats, arrived into Rome  ( flight) to  being told there was no lounge  available (no advanced  warning was not offered apology or use of other  seats or even  travel voucher). The flight and onboard  was disappointing, business class seats are  the same as economy apart from  a tray secured  on the middle seat which made  eating in and  around near imposable.  Menu laughable (3 finger sandwiches). No  live entertainment. In sum, I will never fly British  Airlines again."
1.0,"The British Airways  Experience was one of the worst  flights I have  experienced The Business  Cabin seating was  cramped requiring literally  climbing over (and  sitting on) my  own passengers. Additionally,  it was facing  rain while flying.  Customer service was  limited food barely  in the lounge  or in nearly  any way from  the tables, torn  chairs and lack  in power outlets.  They suggest doing  what you can  do avoid this . Their competitors  have them."
3.0,"Check in was  smooth but the  trip was delayed 2 hours due to unexpected windshield  filter replacements. British Airways cabin crew  was not the friendliest or most . I have  never felt attendants to be so indifferent and self less I was  never asked what I wanted to order. I was  not brought what they chose. I  ask for sparkling  water and was  told they had  sold out"". I asked for more  champagne and was  informed they has  run out"". Dessert  came down to  seat selection. In all, the service  is lacking at  times The food was mediocre, and  beverage selection was  limited The seats were comfortable and  seat pod seating was quite good.  the entertainment is  reminiscent of American  movies from the 1990's, very very . The most disturbing was the  failed seatbelt checks all while my belt was visibly  in the sleeping blanket. The ammenity  seats are of economy class standard  like most other airlines. Lavs were not kept clean.  I can honestly  say I will  never fly British  Air again. This  seems a waste of a $5,000.00."
9.0,"Royal Airways from London to Rome,  absolutely perfect on  my last 3 flights. Food was edible, the flight attendant very pleasant. The problem with  Italy is their policy to make  passengers pay to choose their seats, very Ryanair."
6.0,"On to Stockholm  I was delayed  by little leaving , due to  the typical congestion.  Air Europe on  UK Airways 767  did not have  the new seats,  although comfortable for  over two hour  journey Food was  disappointing at best. The Heathrow Galleries lounge has little  in the way  a food selection.  Food on board  is FA's good.  We feel British  airlines are lacking behind their competitors."
9.0,"Then booked with  Virgin Manchester to  London and they  canceled my return  flights without offering re-routing. Then re-booked  by Brussels Airline  and they had  been at Brussels  and runway repairs  and to their  satisfaction rebooked me with BA. Finally  got my flight  home with British , comfortable, good  and great choice of films. They  had half a  flight because I went to the  ticket information desk  in Moscow Airport and asked 'Do  I speak English?' to a lady  with BA uniform confidently expecting the  reply ""of course"". I got a shake of the  head and a  hand pointed towards  a colleague already  travelling with another ."
3.0,"We fly with  British Airways, unless you don't have  one or don't  think about it.  I took a  connecting flight via  an LHR to San Diego and  found our baggage  one of many  BA passengers in this flight), was  enough for two ! Other flyers  warned us this  carrier is frequent  on BA. When  the baggage finally arrived, one of the suitcases was  broken beyond repair. We filed a  grievance but so  far (more than  one month) heard  back from them  after several calls.  Great attitude. As  the final accord,  for the return  trip we could  NOT check online,  for some unclear reason, while other passengers could. So  the wife and I got separate  plane seats. Nice."
7.0,"LHR-AMS-LHR checked in online which is  quick and simple bag drop at  gate very quick,  been able to  use the lounge  in my FFS which I like. Boarding on to a full flight quick and seats on an exit  are comfy with  lots of room for 1hr flight,  cabin clean and  with a drink served, arrived on time and bags off pretty quick.  checked in on  time for the  check bag drop quick as was security, the gate  office is a  quick walk from security. Used the BA lounge which  although small is nice although not  a food option..  waiting for A321  takes a while but departed on time and once on board the aircraft appeared new.  Was served a drink on the 50 minute flight arrived on time  checked out quickly.  all in all a decent service for a short flight."
4.0,"British Airways from  Birmingham to Bahrain  on return. Both  were on a  fairly old Boeing 777, apparently there  is only a few of these . Advantage is that the seats are still 3-3-3 and not 3-4-3. Both flights on time. Outbound flight very full, cabin crew worked hard  and without much  success Meal was very poor, the so-called dinner was chicken in a slimy gravy. There was no sign of either fresh fruit or vegetables. Later a cardboard box was issued containing a chicken . Return flight food was even worse, but as  time was 1.30 am the initial effort, called a ""snack"", was again in a cardboard box, and contained  two dry biscuits and a couple  of minibars of  milk Later in the flight ""breakfast"" was served. The choice was mixed  grill with chicken  and omelette. The mixed grill turned  in to be an amorphous yellow  substance pretending to  resemble egg, with a round coin shaped structure which was so-called chicken and four potato discs. It was a disgrace and  now British Airways has to do something about its  food it compares very poorly with other airlines. If the food is not worth eating , they should not serve it."
9.0,"Our first class lounge at Heathrow  was reasonably quiet. Great choice of beverages and champagne and selection of food. Plenty of sitting options, light, magazines and newspapers. Very impressed with champagne and the  cocktail bars. After  years of traveling with British Airways still I have  not managed to  secure a treatment in the Elemis spa even when  we travel first  class at the  airport reception rather rude). Boarding on time and by priority. Window seat  on the last row of the club world cabin on the upper deck of A380 with aisle access.  Very polite. The  staff was good. Good selection of  foods and beverages , wines. Wide  selection of entertainment.  Most comfortable and private by using  a divider. The  catering kit adequate.  Everything was on time."
6.0,"That was the  second time we 've traveled long haul with British Airways. The ground  personnel at terminal  7 were helpful and friendly. The aircraft cabin was  my biggest disappointment,  it hadn't been updated since the  aircraft entered service.  While inflight entertainment  area was tiny and unclear, film  screening was good.  Fast food was  good and flight was on-time. If  other airways are  adding a new  aircraft on your route, its likely  – but if  yours is one  of their Boeing  777 (old planes),  we would consider other airlines."
1.0,"The British Airways  flight from Helsinki  for London had issues with it's brakes so the  decision was delaytd.  First departure time was at 17.15, there were next  flights at 18.30, 19.00, 19.30 and  then The captain  gave us an  update of situation  at the gate  opened at 19.00.  Food vouchers were give at 20.00 for those who  was still at  boarding gate. Then  at 21.00 an  offer to get  ticket and hotel  tickets from the  departure hall. Next  flight will be given next morning  from 09.00, which  time was postponed  until 14.30. Requests  about rebookings were  ignored as the  passengers were not  happy They just  to come to  the airport early  but British Airways  refused to provide  info about EU  passport rights as it had to  be requested separately.  Many of fellow  passengers were not  informed of their  rights Next afternoon  the grond handling company only had regular number of  boarding desks open  but there were  no flights cheking-in at the same  time So only  three desks open and they were  only able to start checking us , but requesting us to step  in for the same day flight passengers. Great as  we had only been waiting around  here for our flights. Finally our flight got new  departure time which  is at 17.30,  was to changed . At the  airport departure time  came and went  and no announcement  is made. Departure  time were postponed  until 18.30 with no announcement of reason for new  time When requesting  some futher information  all was said  was the same reason as yesterday but we had  been given a  written statement saying this aircraft had  been fixed. At  last still no  announcements and passengers  became anxious about mimimal information given  the aviator. Then  30 min later  Swedish Airways cancels  the flight. Now  they promised by next morning or then have to  contact British Airways . Another hotel  room at the  next hotel and  we already knew  what the procedure goes. Next day rebooked for Finnair flight to London , arriving London 45 hrs late  and reaching the final destination about  hour late. The  only positive aspect was cockpit and  ground crew effort  to provide some  help at the  boarding area at  this beginning of  our ordeal."
7.0,"BA Airways 3-class  Delta 777-200 is used on this flight to Bangkok.  It was seated in 26D which is a bulkhead  area on the  right behind the  Premium Economy cabin. I like the fact that BA  can have 3-3-3  seating layout on the B777 in  Bangkok while many  carriers are using 3x4x3 lay out.  We had plenty of legroom and  in this particular  night I had the best sleep.  Prices were average, certainly not bad.  Flight crew kind , professional. All  and all a  nice flight."
6.0,"Flew British Airways  to Glasgow to  London via Heathrow.  London to LHR flight great, clean  and staff friendly.  Staff lounge in Glasgow was most enjoyable. Heathrow to  Manchester in premium economy (economy class looked very cramped), the plane was  very scruffy and my foot rest  suggested British Airways  had let the  light slip on  The smartness of the cabin interior , the curtain from Businees to  The Econemy was  not ripped, very  bad bad impression. Excellent staff, food also good. Flights  on time. But  UK Airways Premium Economy is not  another patch on  UK Air. BA  needs to upgrade planes on this route or lose customers to the other carriers. Even  BA staff uniforms  were washed out."
8.0,"Flew British Airways  via Fuerteventura to  Barcelona in a  Airbus A320, with  a new style  and having flown out earlier on  a A319 with the old seating. Nothing much to choose between the  two but slightly preferred the older style. Not sure  how they have the central seat  open to tray space and would  love a wider seat and smaller  luggage space! Legroom  could also be  improved Both flights  were comfortable and  well ahead of  schedule No lounge  facilities at Fuerteventura which is a  surprise Inflight service excellent, food for short-haul was good.  - If only  BA could have  allowed us a  few of inches of extra legroom."
5.0,"From Dublin to  Las Vegas via  Newark Heathrow, then  via Miami to Newcastle. I've been  a staunch fan of British Airways over the years  but am starting  too feel like they're not really  being bothered about international Economy passengers. Service is just okay and certainly  not feel personable  like it once  used to, whereas  here it is  no good. British  Airways Boeing 747's  look old and  tired and look  that way too.  Flight from the  USA is not  terrible but from  a USA is  just inedible. They really need to sort this out. Inflight entertainment is  terrible in comparison  of other airlines.  I will be  on other airlines  if I go to the USA !"
4.0,"Also starting to go with British  airlines less and less. I must  remind you about BA's picky prices,  they jump suddenly with no explainable reason. For example,  that LAX flight I was looking  for went from  € per person per way, to  € per person per way, in  only one day!  The last trip with them (Jersey to Miami) wasn't  that good. Service at Jersey Airport  & London Gatwick  airports was great, but the plane wasn't so good.  Passenger seats are  really uncomfortable, food is a bit disgusting, inflight entertainment  was absolute rubbish,  all the in are just outdated and need replacing/refurbishing. The worst part  came as Miami, where the 'Express' Bag Drop only , turned out  and be slower than the Check point and Bag ging lane, and even that was slow. Worse, the staff were rude and honestly couldn't  complain less. Sad  how this airline  is meant to  help Britain in  every way."
4.0,"fly British Airways  in Toronto to Rome via London, and have no complaint with our flights or crew which were excellent. But when we  arrived in Rome, my opinion of  British Airways was formed. None of  their passenger baggage  was in Rome and we were all left in the dark. When no baggage came down, we all got into the baggage handler lineup, Avia, and wasted time filling out a form. We were given a  telephone number for British Airways but it was out of service. Calls to Avia went unanswered. We finally  got outto the  terminal 2 days  later and found our baggage in an unsecured location.  we werd never informed by British Airways if and  when we would receive our baggage. We did receive compensation for the clothing and toiletries we had to  buy but not fod the expense  of getting out to the airport. This has soured our opinion of  British Airways."
7.0,"I paid for  BA to get a First upgrade  on my return, as the British Airways Club World seats are not great for this long trip. The new First product  looked excellent. The service was greatthe seats comfortable, inflight entertainment very good, and the food was well presented, with a good choice of wines. I slept well,  and actually enjoyed  my journey - one I do very regularly on other carriers but chose BA this time for a change. Bags were tagged as priority  and in Sydney they came out after about 120 other pieces of luggage, meaning I nearly missed my onward connection to Melbourne. Staff gossip  in the galleys , it's a flimsy curtain and I don't want to hear about  their boyfriend troubles,  travel plans, or crew roster. Cleanliness of the toilets  was the responsibility of the staff to monitor, but  at First the toilets are too cramped, and I  ended up wiping the toilet floor  down with tissues and sanitary wipes . I didn't  know what that liquid on the floor was. While safety and the journey are the  very important things, it's these ""Attention to detail"" items that make or break the service . BA ground crew, ticketing agents, cabin crew, pilots are commendable, but British Airways needs to help them to get the service right."
2.0,"We paid for World Traveller Plus  (+ Economy) for our British Airways flight to London. Aircraft was a Boeing 777, excellent . Cabin crew, very efficient and  Economy Seats and legroom, very good.  Something I find lacking to make  World Traveller Plus  worth the money  was no priority  seating or security, no priority boarding for WTP passengers. In fact WTP  passengers were the very last to board? Even United, Delta and American offer priority check-in  and boarding. I contacted British Airways to inquire why and the reply was the usual corporate speak ""We're very sorry you  are disappointed, blah,blah,blah."" Okay British Airways,  I could care ."
1.0,"My issue is  the very poor British Airways customer  relations service you  get once there  is an issue, it is only  something you see  from BA really . Following a dreadful experience trying to sort out a weekend in  Dubai I decided  to complain to British Airways customer relations, that was  the start of  my nightmare and  frustrating experience. BA customer service is  really the Fawlty  Guy of customer services! I have tried many times ringing, longest on hold before I  gave up was  2  fastest  for 45 mins.  BA only want  the get you  on the phone  as quick as they can and  keep apologising that they are so  rude I have  rang them and  had 5 generic  messages back no resolution, worst is  calls are from  2 different people  and clearly have nt read the  tweets from previous  customers I have had two phone calls following tweets  where all they tried to do  to sell me  out and had no idea that I was trying  and complain. They  say they would  call customer services  to call me,  and guess what, no call!"
9.0,"as always, the  entire BA experience  from website to  fly was seamless and effortless. This  was my preferred  route for long  and well as  long haul flights  and I've had  some happy miles under the belt with BA. The  website is extremely  simple to use , a positive  experience from the  BA Cabin crew  was friendly and  welcoming and food . I am  not vegetarian so  will not comment  on the normal  food served. Planes on the Cape  Coast route a  little dated now  and does the  job well. Well  deserved for being a star airline. Looking forward to  spending more hours in the air  for BA."
6.0,"The A380 is a splendid aircraft with a great  customer experience. I chose to fly MEL-LHR via HKG  where I could try British Airways  new A380. I was so disappointed to see that they have used the old ""Backwards / Forwards""  design for Club World on this new aircraft type. I remember using this seat type back in 2002,  and it is now tired and lacklustre when compared to other airlines. A brand new  design and tired old seat design. It felt as though we were being packed in so that British  airlines can max  out the revenue. The whole thing was a bit claustrophobic. The service  were okay but not outstanding, the  atmosphere was good and the wine choice excellent. Ground  crew in HKG were pretty average, but in London were helpful."
6.0,"British Airways is an airline with  some very mixed quality. I am  using it very often and I think that quality  was decreasing over the last few months.  Whereas lounges are great , the staff is almost nice,  but flight attendants sometimes are unfriendly. On this flight  the flight attendant  told me twice  about his cabin  area and did not even excuse himself. The aircraft , the seats  in Premium Economy  are quite good including food and drinks.  But the worst with BA is customer  care and help with problems. On  my outbound flight from PHL to  London I had  the problem with  getting a seat. Although it was shown as free  on the map (no bassinet!) I  was not able  ot select it. First time calling  BA customer support I was told this is a  human error. Second  time the lady told me that this is not  free as this  was next to  a bassinet. Then one day later is was reserved. I called again  but they told  them that I  was too late.  The hint on my two other  calls was answered  with ""that's your  problem You have  the seat what 's the problem?"". I mean at  times she is right but the attitude is extremely bad and maybe there is a reason why I  want to have  this seat. My email with a complaint on this  is answered till  I excet for the automated we will answer asap.  For British Airways  continue with that customer service I  will change shortly."
8.0,"I use the Las Vegas to  Birmingham Heathrow route  as my primary choice getting to Europe. Flight was on time, British Airways cabin staff provided excellent customer  support Food choice  also great. Past  reviews are on  and about the inflight entertainment needing an update."
3.0,"British Airways from  Glasgow to Manchester - ok it's  just a 35  minute flight but about a one  hour delay with  little explanation before take off and  an apology from  the flight deck. I booked a seat near the  back and was  moved to the very back row  out of a  group of aircraft'.  And I could hear every word  in conversation from the young cabin crew in the galley. And not  doing things the  staff should be  doing Torn uniform ed female attendant,  bad drinks service  and male steward who gave the  excuse that the  aircraft is a  bit beneath him. Waiting ages for  the plane to  arrive so I could get off.  Airlines not helping  matters and no  human contact for the dismal goodbye  after getting off."
3.0,"First and last time travelling with British Airways. The flight outw was reasonable, although they are sadly lacking in comparison to other airlines. My  only question is does anybody from  UK Airways actually read these comments? If they do how can they go on providing a service that is so bad? We arrived in  London on 9th September to be told our luggage had been left at Heathrow along with 80 other . They were well prepared at Toronto to deal with us having been forwarned of the problem -  on filling in the relevant forms we were informed  the our bags would be with us in 24 hours, nut it was 2.5 days later when we were finally reunited  with them. British Airways should investiage the company they use in Toronto as they were extremely rude when  they telephone to  us when they thought the bags would be delivered, even hanging up  with the Hotel  manager who tried to help us. Only after my Husband asked where they were and said he would  get the bags himself did we get an answer, and then it took until 9.00 p.m. on the Friday to be delivered. The final  straw was having paid extra for two seats together by the window on the return journey, we found out upon checking in that we could not have these seats and we had to sit in a  group of 4 - not a  lot normally. but it had cost  them extra to  get these seats, and not one of the staff was interested, just a take or leave it attitude. "
2.0,"Left Heathrow to San Francisco with  British Airways and unimpressed. Checked in  late but had  a bag to  prove I was  issued with a  valid boarding pass  at the airport,  I was there , early enough.  It seemed normal  until I reached  the gate for boarding - the scanner at the  boarding checkpoint reported  ""… checked in"".  After a 5  minutes or so  later I was  asked to board,  and moved to  my different seat , was told  that was the  correct one, but  not given any  explanation as to  why Once on  my plane, I  am asked to move to what  turns out to  was my original  seat I filled  my BAs feedback  forms about this  - asked what  is going on,  saying they were  not receiving a  large volume of complaints and never  mentioned In the  event I think  I stick with  less reliable airlines  from now on. The flight itself  got delayed by  1 1/2 hour  while they waited  on ""more passengers"".  the flight itself  is uneventful, and  my meals and service okay for economy. Having said , the Boeing  747 is horribly  slow and the  security system repeatedly  crashed and had to be rebooted."
4.0,"Anyone not one  into publishing reviews  or following discussions of flight problems, have just heard of Skytrax. I have lost track of the numbers  of flights I've  flown over the  decades on business  in Europe and  for holiday worldwide.  My family in the US, regular  holidays have almost  exclusively till now been with British , some economy,  more WTP, more  frequent in Business.  The value etc  seems to now  go from acceptable  - good, occasionally . Shame things seem to have  happened For our annual trip last December I booked  my 7-year old  daughter and myself on British Airways  flights to Chicago,  Chicago from Washington  DC to LHR.  Two flights in  Business Class. Booking  it online reasonably  easy with helpful assistance from a  service person"" when there was a  cancellation - which  occurred 3 times  in the months  after departure. No  good sense used  - flights are  full and ""suitable "" booked, when  I had been , when clearly travelling with a  child Check-in and  departure were smooth.  Best in economy  except that they  seat children first.  As in business , they serve  and serve after the adults.  The ""child meal"" (when it eventually  came was a  disappointment I wouldn't  feed it to  any animal! Peas , mash dried , crusty. Not  sure she didn't want it. Ended up eating my  Kindle Entertainment screen  book for children  as part of  the treat of the journey) didn't  help so we  swapped seats -  but no entertainment  - for Mummy!  thank goodness I  brought my Kindle. No apologies from staff. More interested  than the male  leisure travellers. Return flight after Christmas !  Washington Dulles to LHR was slightly better.  Kids meal available in lounge prior  of boarding -  if you're an  adult Again nothing  with children except  for biscuits. If  I willing to pay British Airways  Economy Class fares  for myself and  my daughter, I  expected better service than this. Very disappointed. Will I  try BA again?  Slowly but grudgingly  but once the  tickets are used , who knows?"
5.0,"Flight to London  by British Airways.  Passenger service was good, except that  they gave given  off on collecting  my Seat is  getting tired -  its coming off.  The level of  smell - between  the seat and  either side of  my cabin was  two very old  pile of fluff,  including peanuts, crumbs,  two old sandwich , and a  half mars bar  of old). Felt . Given this was highlighted in  British press recently , it must  be that British  Air really does  indeed care."
9.0,"Reviewed on the  last flight 7th  September - good  on the way.  Cabin was fine,  seats nice. Staff  is great. Checked  bag on ine  with long queue  to bag drop - BA need  to improve this.  Once again a  huge queue but  that is reflective  to the troubled  times we live , I fear.  arrived on 16.35 , 22nd September  – everything fine  ( seat 11b  has permanent recline  - realise it , I got  asked about it  prior to landing  - apologised to  everyone behind me).  Cabin and Red  Robin were nice.  So I booked early and got  the great price, I have no complaints. Flight deck  looks good both  ways"
3.0,"We recently travelled  British Airways from  Birmingham to London , This is the 3rd time  I have flown  this route onboard one of the Boeing 747-400 and  i must say  UK Airways have  failed to either  significantly upgrade their  entire fleet or  retire the aircraft. The seats are far too cramped , not comfortable,  and in flight  they had to  have rebooted several  times as they  stopped working or didn't work at  all the heat  in the cabin  was unbearable at  times and very  hot The only plus points were  crew who were  very attentiveand willing to help and  their food wasn't  half bad. I  am aware that  all 18 Boeing  aircraft are getting  bigger but by the look of  it unfortunately the B747 on the  London route is not, and for  now as the  way I travel,  gives me concern , has me  contemplating if I  should travel with BA again.   If everyone can  afford to fly  last or first , that doesn't  mean that we  gave up on  our right to have a little  space to move,  toilets that don't  look like they are going to  hurt you, have  a entertainment system  that works and  have a better  mix of movies/tv . Other airlines  like as Emirates  use a fabulous system even in  London so why  does British Airways  have the same  kind of technology.  Clearly BA want  to compete, please do something about  it "
8.0,"Check-in for my British Airways flight at Gatwics North Terminal with no queue and staff friendly and chatty. Boarding was quick. The A319 had not yet been  upgraded with the new seats, but  these were still comfortable and moderately spacious. The cabin crew were friendly  & attentive. The return journey was also quite good, except the flight was change to a 01:10 departure instead of 23:40 so it meant that nearly most shops (except duty  free at Alicante ) closed. Also it meant that  our flight arrived back into Gatwick at 02:40 which wasn't very pleasant  and we had to then drive another hour and a half home. British Airways Gatwick operation is quite good and punctual  just like Heathrow. com"
1.0,"These British Airways flights were undoubtedly  the worst we've ever had to South Africa in  the years of travelling there. The seats were narrow, lumpy and incredibly  uncomfortable especially for  the long haul ! I thought initially that we were unlucky and  suffered broken or  damaged seats on  the outward journey,  but they were  almost as bad  for the return journey. To add  insult to injury,  I selected and paid for seats  of our preference, but when we got to the  airport for our  next journey we were told the seats were gone,  and simply told  you would have to apply for a refund. The  worst aspect of  our flight however, was the heat.  The aircraft was oppressively hot and stuffy for hours on the way from Johannesburg to London. Many passengers complained but the crew could apparently do nothing because the air conditioning  units appeared too old to regulate  air temperature. Also the entertainment system  had to be  turned off and  replaced several times  but many passengers'  tickets were not  available There were  passengers who had to do without  breakfast for the  whole 10 hour flight. These aircraft are not fit for flying and  should have been  over a decade ! Pity the poor crew who have to work  in these clapped-out  aircraft every day.  Have been travelling to South Africa  many times a  week for the  previous decade and this was our  third time travelling  with British Airways. Clearly it will  always be our  last Avoid British Airways or their  Boeing 747-400s at  ALL costs."
6.0,"Return to London  to return in  September 2015, both  flew in Economy  in an A320.  Quite pleasant but  worth doing more  than absolutely required.  Free snack and  sandwich were served  for both legs.  Each time the  sandwich consisted of  a mini pastrami  and cheese sandwich  with a mini black currant bun.  Nice but not  its best sandwich .  Additional  sandwiches were served  on request. Both  flights featured the new slim seats  and the cabin  for reduced legroom. While the seat are slightly better  then the Recaro slim seats, I  like the older more comfortable seats  with better leg . I did  NOT really realize that BA has changed the rules recently and travelling  solely with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer  allowed to pick  their seat during check-in, but a  ticket is randomly . Selecting any seat (even a  free seat in  either back of  class now costs  EUR 18). Also, if one later decides to check  another piece of  furniture the costs are a whopping EUR75 at the  door or EUR35  in line.  The final fare  from BA can  seem substantially higher  then the initial  ticket quote -  no additional charges are displayed during  the booking process and if one commits to checking  baggage during the  booking process, the  charges are lower.  With the exception of a free drink and sandwich,  Qatar Airways Economy  flight is now  pretty much a  regular airline product.  The Oneworld Sapphire  did not help  - No privileges  and still the  additional charges for seat selection and checking luggage. While  BA was on  board the return LHR-VIE leg was delayed for one hour. After a  successful boarding the  return plane was  waiting for the  landing but then  BA flight deck announced that they are waiting for  the cargo to  have loaded and they missed their  departure slot, which meant waiting an  hour for a  new slot. So, basically BA inconvenienced  their whole plane  forcing passengers to load some delayed  cargo Flying with  hand baggage only,  BA used web mail for both  seats which worked fine. Boarding procedures  was unremarkable and  luckily BA uses a shared lounge  with VIE. The  service as such  were acceptable (small  and mostly packed), but far from  comfortable with limited  service lower quality ! The selection  seemed to be more or less  the same in all lounges in  both BA Galleries  but in LHR , a comfortable  lounge amid a  bustling airport and food and drinks  that was better  than VIE. Wine selection was nice.  BA still uses T3 for its  access to VIE,  which I consider  the huge benefit  over using T5,  which tends to  create a mess  for passengers. While I stopped flying <mask> Airways Business in Europe they BA changed Business <mask> to Economy <mask> with no <mask> legroom, I <mask> no valid reason to pay <mask> surcharge for <mask> product, but <mask> still consider <mask> one of the better options <mask> Economy flights <mask> Europe. However <mask> new low-cost <mask> concept also means that the times when I was willing to <mask> higher prices just for flying <mask> BA over <mask> or Austrian <mask> this route <mask> unfortunately over."
5.0,"The British Airways seats were extremely small, uncomfortable and  could not operate properly. In order to recline the  plane or return it to the upright position you had to do it manually. The  toilets throughout the  airport were dirty and smelly from the minute we boarded. The meals British Airways served were abysmal. On the way home from London to the U.S. passengers had the choice of a chicken  soup dish with saffron rice or  the vegetarian option. The smell of curry makes me nauseated so I opted for the vegetarian dish. I was served greasy,  over seasoned pasta soaked in oil and covered with a soggy bread crumb topping. It was inedible. My partner received the  chicken curry dish which was small, fatty pieces of chicken overly seasoned and soaked oil. The dishes served are poorly chosen for the general population of people who fly British Airways. The food should be clean,  fresh food not  covered in grease and oil and not overly seasoned. The portions are too small and the dessert items chosen are also odd and not appealing to people. It appears British Airways will serve just about anything so they can keep the food prices down and the profits up."
4.0,"Denver to London  on British Airways. We were allocated  comfortable seats near the toilets. The  seat would recline  or would creep forward during the  trip which bent  my jack in my headphones.  Lately we've found the aircraft are tired and in much need of an update. Poor quality screens - very small seats. Not much bigger than a short  leg flight. Find the air hostess / stewards are often quite bored and provide a no thrills service. There's not much wrong with them  pro se, but a smile would go a long way. We now  will look for other airlines to fly with as we've had enough of British Airways  and long haul flights."
5.0,"Heathrow to Munich return with British  Airlines I have never published a negative review of  airlines ever before,  i work in  customer service industry  I have several friends who are cabin crew. I  am not a  regular passenger, I rarely request anything unless invited to  doing so and  also rarely request anything other than water. However my  first experience of  UK Airways business  trips was let  down by crew serving me. The female cabin attendant  on my return  flight could not have been nicer, but the male  crew on my flight out was  very dismissive of me as a female passenger. To  two men sitting near me he  became chatty and offering them extra  water etc. I  am made to  seem like a huge inconvenience. Such  a shame and it has made  one reconsider whether the extra cost is worthwhile."
1.0,"Have flown previously  in British Airways Business Class. Flew in World Traveler economy class on this trip, with adult children on their first flight to England. Loading was chaotic. Seated middle four seat , row 49. No air conditioning in cabin. Several  among us complained about heat and lack of air flow. Did not get answer from  airline until an hour into the  trip Took 3 hours before air conditioning kicked in. No room under  back seat to store handbag. Seats  had to be smaller. When person in row in front of me reclined, I had minimal room to move or to access my purse. Little attention from cabin attendants. Told them I was getting dizzy from lack of cool air, and they allowed me to move to seat in galley where air was cooler from Business Class seats. Food served was terrible. No advance menu to choose from. No individual lighting or air. I thought it was my worst experience until  my 2.5 hour wait in line to clear immigration / customs. Our prepaid taxi waited 90 minutes and then left. Horrible experience. The return flight was worse. Delayed 1.5 hours on the ground due to no air conditioning in Coach seating again, though First and Business had it. They brought us water in the last 30 minutes. Will never fly British Airways again."
8.0,"Another very pleasant experience apart from  our so called fast track lane  that took 20 minutes. The business class lounge was  really nice with  some great choice  for drinks and snacks for early morning departure. As a regular on  my Gatwick to Sharm el Sheikh route it was a breath of fresh air to have the option of a full service airline and Oneworld member. The  first class seats  cost the same as economy class  of the A320 but the middle seat blocked off  slightly for me,  so the fare  structure was very  comparable to easyJet  standard rates. Excellent service from take-off  to landing."
4.0,"Sharm el Sheikh to Gatwick. I checked in at British Airways business class counter and  the agent was  hostile and unwelcoming.  So my questions  involved him having to ask a  person in the  actual economy class check-in. I asked staff where the lounge access was located and was  immediately told there . No lounge access - despite  them stating on their website that  first class passengers have access to  the Royal Jordanian lounge (which I  had no sign of) so I  opted to use  the general and expensive SSH airport facilities. Boarding was absolute mayhem with no separate call for business class or Oneworld members to board first. So I jumped  off the bus to be called off and told the check-in agent  he booked me in economy class row 8D, which was listed as  economy class at  first check-in. After  a wait of 10 minutes, a  special boarding bass was issued for  Row 1C, and  an aircraft bus had to be called back to pick me up. Onboard things did  fine and chatted with friendly crew. However the pre-boarding did not represent  a premium product."
8.0,"First time to  experience British Airways new shorthaul cabin  after a flight from Heathrow to  Birmingham and we  was pleasantly surprised. I am 6'1  but found the  elbow room in the aisle seat  would be fine.  Economy seat was generally comfortable (though  bigger would be nice!), brown leather looks good and  the lighting calming.  All very good.  We did look at the business class seats which  look basically the  same as economy,  so will probably  never fly business  with BA shorthaul s but will  continue with economy.  BA staff were  very professional and pleasant. You may however want to  take your own packed lunch as the morsels given are not good."
7.0,"Royal Airways Boeing  737 was a  little long in  its tooth, with old style Club World seat, old  audio system, audio  very loose and needed constant fiddling  to keep sound coming through both . The isolation of the window  area in BA Club World is  a double-edged sword : privacy is  important but cabin crew tend to forget you -  for this flight,  it did not  have a hot  chocolate or an  order of a  cold drink, though  everyone else around  me did. All  said and done,  the flight was on time, food , wine were  plentiful and I  felt pretty comfortable."
6.0,"Our morning flight  in Stockholm to  London on Sep  1 Sat in  our first row which had a  little bit more legroom, but compared  to the older  Eastern Europe seats, not very comfortable. The purser seemed  to have had  a relly bad  nights sleep in Stockholm being really rude and unfriendly  with customers, but  talking loudly with  my fellow FA's.  She kept on  slamming the doors  in the galley loudly throughout the  flight My friend who flew business  style for first  aid was shocked. Fortunately our late evening return flight  told a totally  similar story with  a extremely attentive  flight purser who was there all  that flight."
4.0,"Welcome to Seattle  on British Airways, and I was  really disappointed when dinner was being  served and to  my surprise they did not have  the vegetarian meal onboard - but somehow they gave  us others! Although I requested my special meal when I booked my flight (return) at least 5 months earlier as well as checking in online. In the  plane I sat while everyone else  slept around me! This was a  late flight, couldn't sleep and remained hungry so I didn't enjoy the  meal"
7.0,"We had not  flown British Airways business class for  myself Sydney to Singapore was a  long flight and I probably wouldn't  care as much  on other airlines  with this product,  but if it  was cheaper than  Emirates I would pick it. Seats a bit narrow  but otherwise acceptable  and I like the fact you  could slide the  tray away and  step out easily. Service was top  class and very surprised, had an excellent stewardess in  my area. Meal  tray with two  vegetables and some  stale bread along  with a decent  coffee Small snack  before landing -  you always feel  that a bigger option should be provided on a  10 hour flight,  as it is too small for  me not to  need to eat  but when you  land IFE had a good selection  which worked fine.  I like the  way they have  changed out the  New World cabin  - it is a bit different , although crowded  and is calm  and professional. Obviously  these seats do  not compare to the best out  here If they  were materially cheaper  to say Singapore Airlines or Emirates  then I would  buy it. If they want to  have a similar price then obviously  the product is  exactly the same  quality "
3.0,"Tokyo Haneda to Heathrow in Club World with British Airways.  My trip was on  my old Boeing 777, and apart  of the old  seats I could not believe the  rot and wear in this cabin. Crumbs and mess around the bottom  right edges of  the seat, grubby marks that I  swear even the Japanese cleaners could not remove. The toilet I used remained dirty throughout  this flight. The meal service has  been much debated, and is served (rather pushed at you) on a  regular economy style format, and quality is on a  par with JAL economy class I used in August.  I British and like to support BA, but the honest fact is , BA have slipped right down against from the  top My journey  here was from  London on Lufthansa, an airline I  certainly wouldn't have used a few years ago, but  the business class  prices are so much higher. BA cabin staff should  go to Lufthansa  with some training, and maybe they could lose some of their arrogant approach. "
3.0,"A 3 hour delay but notified by text earlier in the day so no waiting around. The problem  is that British Airways Business Class Club World product and service is so old and tired that it is just very poor value and quality. The inflight entertainment is constantly faulty and breaking  and they had to keep resetting it (this has happened on the last two BA Club flights I have been on), the seats are tired, it was not very clean  - the lockers  and the windows on the upper deck were dirty and falling apart.  the food was quite good except the dessert was awful - they always seem to serve the same lemon dessert on this leg. The  people were pleasant,  but the planes are too old and tired now to make this an attractive option. I look to avoid British Airways  when I can  afford Business Class."
8.0,"Barcelona to London Heathrow and late again! British Airways really need to sort out their schedules. I can always guarantee a  seat out of foreign terminal, but early or on-time when flying outbound. Lateness is normally due to baggage or missing person or someone who has not turned  in to travel. The food service  was still complimentary thank goodness. You get a twin pack of a roll and currant bun on the Barcelona route - better than a huge panini they  used to serve. Drinks service is  very limited as  its one serving only of Tea/Coffee.  Considering the price, using a schedule service into London Heathrow and complimentary  a snack for  under £39 was a bargain!"
1.0,"My son and his fiance travelled to St Kitts to get married. They spent ten days on their wedding-moon. When it was time to return they were unable to check in online. The  airlines offered a  different number to call and there was no answer. They tried for three hours. They finally called me in the UK and I called British Airways. I was told that because I did not buy the tickets with my credit card, they couldn't help me. I was given  a number to call. The second person I spoke  with managed to resolve the problem that was preventing online check in, which meant that it was then possible. However, so  long time had passed sorting this  problem out that by the time we got into the system most of the seats were allocated and my son and his new bride could not sit next to one another for this long haul flight. When they tried  to upgrade they were told it would be $1000US each. British Airways  couldn not care less."
10.0,"Maybe I've just flown US carriers too much, but I think British Airways is a cut above them, as it has been in the last few years.  They take care of you during the flight. Multiple drink services with alcoholic beverages included, and water and orange juice through the flight. Hot meal service to begin with a better than average beef offering, and then a sandwich, tea, etc before landing. I am part of their  student flyer program and was given a different seat from the one  they had selected - the seat just behind the  aisle Ordinarily I don't like those  rows as there's  where to put your things when the plane takes off, but I was in the middle and the three seats between  myself and the  guy in the other aisle seat in my row were empty (presumably this is why I was moved to this seat, as it was ) so I just used the seat beside me and it worked out fine. Seat was wider than US economy, with  good leg room, and a leg rest that came out from below, so quite comfortable. I can't ever say I enjoy a 7+ hour flight, but flying with British Airways makes it more bearable. "
4.0,"Having previously flown with British Airways  over few years  ago I was  very disappointed. The  service was as  expected and I  had no complaints  about that, but  the food was  terrible and the service was terrible.  We were sat next to a  group of drunken passengers who were  overweight and were  seen to be  offered drinks throughout.  I am sure  that didn't make  our cabin crew  very easy but  things seemed quite  busy - running  low of drinks ? As we  sat sitting in  the back of  our plane there  appeared to be  no choices by  which time we  were offered food  and the crew  was not really interested. When asked  for an alternative they forgot to  refer back to  it and when  pressed again they  did exactly what  I refused. The  food was poor  - dry hard  bread with very  poor flavour. Breakfast  was an egg  and roll and  again there was  no alternative. I paid extra to  travel with British  Airways but found the service and food lacking -  I would not  consider flying long  hours with them  if you can  afford it. You  can see they  have made cuts  in the budget!"
5.0,"From Heathrow to  Edinburgh return in  US Airways Club  Europe Very disappointing.  Economy seats are  about the same  for economy seats, they just don't  fit someone in  the middle seat,  with no meaningful  improvement in legroom  and width. Food  was very average  on the way  out (salad with  some dry prawns,  really tasteless) but  better on the way back (tagliatelle).  People were on  they whole were  OK but given  these seats I  highly recommend spending the extra money for Club Europe."
2.0,"Got in online for our British Airways flight from  Birmingham to Heathrow. and discovered my wife and I  were seated 4 rows apart. No seats together were available in the  seating chart under ""manage my booking"". Is the BA software so poor  because it can't keep 2 seats together when booked  at the same time? The answer must be yes.  A check-in person said they would  try and get us two seats together when we presented at the gate, but as usual when you  arrive at the bag-drop the staff member will say whatever is necessary  will get you away and through security with minimum  hassle and delay. In this case needless to say our separate seating  remained separate. I wouldn't take the trouble to record this here except  that I have  been irritated for the last few flights I've done with British Airways, with poor food, in-flight entertainment screens  which work intermittently,  broken headphones, or being seated so that the only screen available is the other side of the business  class dividing curtain which was drawn  mid way through  my film. I've preferred British Airways on the basis  because some of the budget operators  charge you the  bill by the time you add their various extra  charges I'm now coming to the conclusion that if they charge the  same I might  as well fly with them and then I won't have to wait an extra 5  minutes to get  onto the plane while the business  rate punters get off first."
8.0,"After a small  stop in AMS,  then departed for  short hop to . Boarding went  smoothly we were  given emergency exit  rooms which were  quite comfortable. At  cruising altitude, we  ate breakfast snack.  The crew was  great except the  one assigned to  this section who  is very talkative  and a bit snobby. Overall flight  experience was great  and service is  the way we  wanted to see . ⚑ British  Plane Ranking"
7.0,"Our British Airways  trip to MIA departed on time  which was full.  we were seated  in the middle  of row, which  allowed extra legroom  because the IFE 's and traytables  are stored in  the seats. The  only thing that  caught our attention  is the state  of the cabin,  as the interior  was old and  worn The same  went for the  seats and seats.  While the seats  are comfortable by form and shape,  they were worn  and a bit hard to sit  and I had  issues with my  computer the whole  flight as it froze and continuously reset itself while  I trying to  start a movie.  This was very  annoying but the  flight crew reset  their system a  number of times  and weren't annoyed by my questions about the problem.  My cabin crew service was excellent,  as was food.  *"
3.0,"from Heathrow to Copenhagen with British Airways, and I  am surprised by  the service. Customer service was poor, particularly on my outward trip. Some  in the cabin  attendants seemed disinterested  and did not  even greet you as you came onboard - they continued to talk amongst themselves and  the customers. The  chairs were uncomfortable, and the little  service they provided  were atrocious. "
10.0,"Atlantic City to  New York JFK  to Shannon with  Thomson Airways. I  was early for the 09.45 departure,  so despite being  super busy, got through to the gate lounge within  minutes Very personal service before take offs and this  continued on for  my flight. A quick stop in Shannon to go  over immigration then  headed onboard for  a wine and  food including one  on the best  pasta dishes I  ever had on a plane. Arrived  good time and bags waiting when  I got to  baggage carousel."
10.0,"Free Bag drop  and no queue  or friendly staff.  Once the aircraft  was left on  approach I found the leg room  / width fine  despite my 6'1""  frame Not over spacious but comfortable  on a 3 hr flight. Aircraft  was clean and  look pretty new.  Quite a step  up from the  often tired 777  and 747s BA  fly on long haul routes. A  variety of food and drink served  by friendly staff helped pass the  time until our  departure time arrival.  A punctual and  helpful  Return  flight was equally  pleasant I have  been with BA and BEA over  this last half  decade and can't see the deterioration  that many complain . The staff  is not perhaps  the same as  it used to . but customer  experience would also  still be the  best"
1.0,"I used British Airways Club Europe from LGW to Naples. Basically the flight is the same as long haul economy except no entertainment and the middle seat is left empty?  as far as I can tell there is no difference in legroom  and seats are  identical to economy.  Am not sure how British Airways  could pass this off as Business  Class  My advice if booking  any business class flight in Europe,  Look at competitors  or book economy , save the  trip Only really  good thing about flight was an  amazing cabin staff that looked after us really well."
5.0,"Paris Heathrow to  London return. Outbound  to Galleries South  London looking shabby.  Very cramped seats  with disinterested cabin  crew and appalling  service Return there , lounge at Kos airport, slow  flight to plane,  thank crew and  packed lunch. Both flights on schedule  and baggage return  was quick. A  trip of two halves, but the  new British Airways  to Europe is  great value."
3.0,"I fly about  5 times a  year 90% of  my time with British Airways. I'm not sure what 's going on  at British Airways,  however their service 's just getting  poorer and worse.  You can see  that individuals are  upset but it  is the business  that doesn't want  them to be  able to deliver  a world class  customer service they  have for all  these years. I 'd only assume  something about cost  savings as their  planes are so  old and falling  into bits now.  And when you  consider it other  airlines like Cathay , American Airlines. In all honesty,  when you can  afford an alternate  airline you'll probably  get a better first class cabin  and cheaper -  we recommend it.  But how does  the airline not  provide Wifi on  a long haul . Once a  darling of the  free world. British  Airways is now  almost half dead  airline with no  real sense of  humour"
7.0,"I am a  semi regular traveller  with British Airways,  where I am  an Executive Club  Member Emerald. I  have recently flown  on a heap  of other Oneworld  airlines and feel  UK Airways service  deteriorating rapidly. The  expectations are smiles when you enter  a cabin, but  when you are  onboard the smiles  are a bit  dull and the  service I would  rate as passable.  Compared with Cathay  Atlantic where crew  will approach the  Guest Status customers  with a full  refund (regardless of ) and give  an extra special ) making you  feel of value,  that is absent  at British Airways.  Thankfully the flight  is short and  easy enough. I  like Exit seat , the legroom  looks very good,  but very good  as the standard  economy seat and  the 1.87m its  tight squeeze. But  after that you  get for a  12 hour flight."
3.0,"London City to  London I've flown  with BA a  lot over the  past most recently in Business and  Economy and have,  til recently, always  had a favourable opinion of them.  I recently used  them to take  the short break to Granada with my brother. My  original choice for  such a short  holiday would have  been economy because  I don't believe  that extra cost  to this be quest money or  time justifies the  additional benefits. Regrettably,  the economy reward  tickets were available  so I opted for Club Europe.  My only real benefit on this  particular route was  the increased baggage allowance, although this was of no  particular use for a 3 to  5 day trip! So what did we get for  these 'business' flights  No lounge at City Airport, no  Fast track at  City Airport, a 'holding pen' prior  to boarding with  everyone standing around  on a small  queue and no  automatic boarding. Seats  for Club Europe  are identical to  that in Economy.  The breakfast going  off was terrible  - food along  ( dried out  cheese and croissant).  My lunch (if  we can call it that) coming  back was also  awful - a cold salad dish  with dried out  fruit accompanied by vinegary wine. No lounge at Granada, No fast track  at Granada, coupled  with a single check-in desk most  of the time , long queues  I complained to  them about this - the initial  response was that  club Europe left  its middle seat  empty to allow  leg room. Whoever responded obviously didn't even think to  change the aircraft,  as there is  a middle seat  for the Embraer  and it's a  standard configuration for the whole aircraft.  After some considerable persistence on my  end a partial  discount of 5,000  miles each was  accepted by British Airways. I recently had the choice  in flying Club  European to Hawaii , to LAX  ( then AA  to HNL) but given the fact  the British Airways  New World can  get quite claustrophobic, ultimately decided to  try out Qatar  Airways new business class to Thailand  ( Doha) -  on all accounts their business class is comparable to  Qatar Airways first class. I shall  ponder this some  more next year!"

What has happened to  British Airways ?"
9.0,Have just returned  to British Airways from St Lucia and enjoyed the flight in Club World on the  entire journey. Cabin  staff especially the purser made the  journey very comfortable. Tasty dining and  fast flowing drinks. A safe and  comfortable flight.
8.0,"LHR-PHX 16 Sept. Last few times  I flown British Airways, I'd been forced to consider  it as a  terrible airline that doesn't deserve its 4 star rating,  and I was not looking forward to this flight. We had awful seats at the  rear of a very full plane so asked at  our drop about : Paid £230  just to go  straight to WTP , bargain when  compare to the price we paid for our seats  on coach) and  that was worth . Does anyone know why we  check in online , go to  their self-serve kiost  yet still have to go to  a drop to  very much go through the check  in process again? Boarding went as usual, smiley welcome aboard and to  good seats. This  plane had WTP  just behind First. Good leg room, comfortable seat, small cabin of its . A small  snack pack is provided, although most  if the stuff  inside it is  small and hardly  worth having. Only  1 FA worked  in cabin but  he was friendly  & efficient and the lack of  support staff was  also noticable. Drinks  served and lunch  was then food . Lunch with 2 options, china  with real cutlery,  glasses etc.   Food was very good, even though only one option  available by time we were served.  Ground beef, which  is tasty and tender and well  prepared A snack  bar was passed  on a few  moments later and  then served 2 hours before landing. Interestingly, dinner was  in economy. Foil dish, plastic cutlery, paper napkins. Given  our price of  our ticket, would have expected better  from that.   Only one juice/water  available but FAs  always in the  mood and happy  and get whatever  they wanted (until we drank tham  full of bubbles!). Being an older plane, the IFE  was ancient with  its very small screen that had  only lines showing  and a barely adequate movie selection.  Flight cancelling headset was not the best and hurt  the ears. IFE was only a minor irritation, as  it was scheduled  4 hours 45 and I was more interested in  knowing which WTP ! Only real  complaint is the  drinks table. It  slides out of  the seat arm  like a drinks tray, then unfolds  like a full . Problem is,  things slide off when in small  spaces and you  had to brace the full tray on your knees to stop your  drink sliding off. British Airways is  banking on its  poor reputation rather than providing a  better product these  parts and I  fly them if  it can because  if that. I didn't think I  would be saying this but I enjoyed this flight and it was <mask> the best <mask> flight I've had. A shame then that I <mask> still avoid <mask> Airways if I can."
1.0,"I have not  got as far  in even flying with British Airways  last time around, and the customer  service are a . Sent an email with flight confirmation and agreed time to us, yet a later email tells us different time. They say we need to take it up with Vueling, their sister company - call Vueling and are told it is a British Airways issue.  None of them  will take responsibility for changing our flight times without asking. It's now  very late to get an alternative  ticket at a reasonable price, so  had to return  at a stupid time in the morning which has ruined our anniversary weekend break. No  refunds or anything.  Another greedy company who thankfully are  in decline. Pay a bit more  and fly with genuine 4 or 5 star airlines. About 3 levels below Cathay Pacific and the rest around that price ."
2.0,"British Airways introduced its new Club Europe business class which is basically economy class, minus the middle seat. Leg room is same as in economy. When I  told flight crew what's new about  class she indicated  waving her hands that the seats were more cramped now. It is a shame that British Airways has fallen prey to greed and instead  on upgrading its business product, it  instead introduced a  very poor product on Club Europe. Food was poor and so was the inflight service.  If the person in front reclines,  is is impossible to even hold a newspaper and read it. I will never fly British Airways Club Europe again."
3.0,"British Airways from Heathrow to Vancouver outbound, Toronto-Heathrow inbound,  all on rather ancient Boeing 747-400. Both flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule and the fare was competitive. Check-in and bag delivery was fine at all 3 airports. The  flight interiors were shabby at best,  seats uncomfortable, IFE hopeless, food awful. Cabin crew were mixed, one or  so fairly pleasant but most going  after their duties  in a perfunctory way. One male  Cabin crew member was so overweight and sweating profusely, it was astounding  that he could still be allowed to fly. From the good days of quality service in the 1980's, British Airways have gradually deteriorated into a third-class carrier and can never hope to compete on customer service with the airlines from the Middle and Far East. What a shame."
4.0,"Flying to Cape Town via Heathrow with British Airways, and the short flight from Glasgow to Heathrow was fine, exit row , with plenty of room, although  our catering was  that bit bizarre, a drink and  small packet of crisps. The flight  to Cape Town  is however a  different story. The Boeing 747-400 used was well past  a major refurbishment  both inside and out. The economy class seating was  all squashed together with virtually no  space to move,  but I'm only  moderately tall. The seat back entertainment  centre must be  next generation, tiny  screen with a  lot of lines on it, I've  seen smart phones with bigger screens! The crew in our section were  all bit perfunctory  in their duties, apart from one  person who smiled  / chatted with and I quote "" guests"" and  generally made the  trip a bit  too bearable. The  fare on offer was standard economy class fare, it  had a gap, just. The flight  time for BA0059  is 11.5 hours,  but British Airways  really need to  increase the inflight quality of their long haul flights  in terms of  a bit more  comfort and better  service for economy class passengers, who  now make up  vast majority of people on board,  not the premium passengers. The old  Brit Airways corporate slogan ""The Worlds Favourite Airline"" are long gone. For  our next flight to South Africa or elsewhere, I  hope it will  revert back to KLM for us."
2.0,"I have flown business class long haul on Emirates, Qatar Airways, Air  Netherlands KLM, American, Singapore, Thai Airways,  Asia Pacific and most recently British  Airways for work within the last 24 months. I fly long haul 8-10 times a year so I  would consider myself to be a moderate user of the service and know what I should expect for the money. I will never fly British Airways again if I can avoid it. I  boarded on time and it felt like a safe journey, but everything from check in, to the seat configuration and comfort (and cleanliness), the food and the entertainment system were so far away from the competition. The cabin crew were snooty on  the A380 out of LHR - in this example I was a silent observer to  the unacceptable customer service responses. The only redeeming feature of the whole experience was the  service at the Washington Dulles lounge,  The rest of BA could learn a lot in there. Very disappointing BA, its a shame your product quality is so below par. I'm proud to be British, but not when it comes to our national carrier, what a  disgrace"
8.0,"Nice and professional British Airways crew. The seat is comfortable and two usb ports and the in-seat power  outlet are nice. Food was ok. In-flight entertainment system far away from Cathay. But the 3D map was  good Overall a  good experience, and  for the money."
1.0,"UK Airways lost  customers by labeling  the case with  a wrong name  of destination. Lost  Airways office at Amsterdam was difficult  TO find, but  staff were helpful.  Information given with  a contact address  to keep you  posted was   totally useless -  4 days of  multiple emails each  with no response.  Phone number called  the Viking concierge  for 10 hours  on and off  after 4 days , totally ignored  your information totally ! Finally after  months a senior  level email address  was found and  then after discussion  if my house  and not on  that day agreed.  Then 26 days , respond to  a letter of  apology 14 days  to date and  still no reply  after second email  or complaint. British Airways customer service  was laughable."
9.0,"An aging British  built Boeing 747-400  was well maintained.  Each seat was  set in World  Class Plus. I was seating on the last row , no pressure  seat inclining the  seats Food was good and a  full bar service.  The flight took  into a cabin  crew greeted everyone  and was one the nicest and cheerful crew I have met. "
1.0,"i am so  annoyed with British  Airways that I  must avoid them  for the future.  When for any reason, you have  a reschedule your  flights their fees  were beyond anything  we ever experienced.  Just booked a  ticket from Istanbul to Denver in Business Class and , due to  circumstances beyond my  control had to . The flight one way was  $ which is  the lot of . Their ""restocking  fee was 25%,  In order for  them to receive  full credit of  part of the  flight fare. In  Denver there was a $525 penalty  and so the  maximum penalty was . So, now  we have a  refund for one  way with British  Airlines and I  never have to  travel with them again.  What  an rip off."
10.0,"Got my flight to Madrid and back on British Airways. Going to  London was on an A321, very nice seats and comfortable. The return leg from Madrid was a Boeing 767, the aircraft is old but the seats were very spacious and comfortable. The cabin crew were fantastic in their job, you only get snack for a short haul 2  day flight, for the price and what is offered  from British Airways it's worth it.  The both journey was excellent, departed and arrived both legs on time."
4.0,"Whilst I don't expect too much from economy I have to say  I was very disappointed with British  Air from Gatwick to Mauritius. I chose this airline as I expected the planes to  stay in good condition and the room slightly better for someone of my height. Instead the seat was so worn out I could feel the frame underneath  and the legroom appalling. The staff were very polite and attentive, but the food left  the lot to be desired."
7.0,"British Airways flight from Moscow to  Edinburgh on an old Boeing 777-200 which needs replacing soon. Bar service and hot lunch served, washroom was clean. Surprisingly this flight had no duty free which was there on  an outbound flight  at St Petersburgh.  Agents were pleasant and friendly. Seats reasonably comfortable, IFE was usual short haul programmes with  a map.      Top British Airways Ranking"
8.0,"London to St Petersburgh flight left  on time, aircraft was clean. The  cabin was not full and we  were given aisle  and window seat with a vacant seat in the middle.  This  is similar to  our business class section. Hot breakfast was served. Overall a comfortable short flight. My only gripe was slow check in at Heathrow T5, as all pax to  board have to  get their Visa  stamped by supervisor. </s> ⚑ British Airways Ranking"
7.0,"We flew from  Los Angeles to  Paris with British Airways, who seem to be working  overtime to improve . What I  cannot understand is why they still have not updated their Club World seating after so many years. Even  the US carriers offer superior seating these days. I don't get it - new British Airways plane but  still old seats. While they are fully flat and I slept well,  my main issues are having to step over other  passengers as there is no direct aisle access and a lack of storage space and cubby holes around  the seat. The  flight crew were mature, professional, and the CSD introduced himself during the flight and seemed  comfortable Catering seems to have improved - I chose  ground beef for  breakfast and instead  of the usual overcooked lump in a casserole dish , was cooked well and plated  thanks to what all first rate airlines do in Business class these days. Instead of the dreaded 'bacon ' for breakfast, there were two hot egg dishes, a toasted sandwich  and a cold plate of meats and cheeses.      Thanks British Airways )"
2.0,"Upgraded to Club  Europe on outward  journey for a treat. Check in queue at ""dedicated Club Europe"" desk was dreadful. Staff like bouncers with  no customer service ! Heard one  said to a  young man ""you  could have got up earlier"". Only when we got restless did they open the fence to let us  through to an  automatic check in operator. Then the ""priority"" security process  was nonsense, just as slow as elsewhere. Staff on  staff excellent. On  last journey I  booked in online as usual. Changed  2 seats to the final row.  Came on board to find the  row had no window. Flight too full to move elsewhere. Partner a  notoriously nervous flyer and had a horrible journey back,  thought he was  in a coffin, and heart flutter  the next day  related to stress of the journey. All made worse  by 30 min  delays on departure and a further  30 min delay  in being allowed to land at . Next day  we contacted British 's customer services  online to ask  why there was no indication at  all on the  assigned seat plan that row 25  of A319 had no window. No response at all apart from automated  saying busy but will get back  with you asap"". A week later  they sent the same response, with  a complaint number, again online. No  reply at all, not even the automated one. I'm  a feeling that British Airways is  copying Ryanair, though even they have  stopped trying to improve their service and image recently. The days of  UK Airways as  a classic British airline, with good service and professionalism went with the  sale of it to other nations. It is not what it appears. We also noted that cabin staff in economy could  not cope with a full cabin.  Because of a trolley starting at  either end, there was only one with two staff.  Even the ""widest  long range jet""  has 25 rows, 6 across this  are not enough.  Numbers have been cut, clearly staff are demoralised and  the service has gone out of the window. Obviously,  including the window  on row 25."
1.0,"30th wedding anniversary  delayed due to British Airways not loading baggage onto flight - not just ours but  a whole flight!  baggage handling belts broken so baggage all piled up in departure lounge. Baggage tracking website  does not work, so that's a waste of time!  Contact centre in London diverts to  call centre in India so you can't understand a thing being said  and vice versa. Pilot and staff must have known  their was no baggage in hold and yet the flight was still allowed to leave. Italian contact number for British Airways lost luggage was unobtainable and given out regardless of that fact. Would not recommend British Airways to my  arch enemy."
1.0,"Worst experience I've  EVER had in  any airport, poor organisation with bad  personal service from  UK Airways staff  that didn't care  if I would  face a 5  hour delay, due  to been told  I would need to cancel and rebook my conecting internal flight. As  our flight was delayed between JFK  to Heathrow. I was appalled to see how badly  this was dealt , and how little effort British  Airways put into organising its customers.  Many people where  forced to go to a service  desk and cancel  & rebook flights,  while others got put in a fast track immigration  process No staff  seemed to care  for the delay  My partner and  I were experiencing after a 7  hour flight. I would never recommend  Brit Airways to  them They only  care about premium paying passengers and the service they  have to offer  has been left behind by other providers. Absolute garbage!!"
1.0,"British Airways Economy on a Boeing 777, London to Bangkok. The seat was terrible, had the IFE release knob wedged in my leg for 12 hours and a food tray  I could not open so unable  to eat. Stewardess asked if I would like to put food tray  over my lap. The seat was not fit for  flight "
1.0,"The Concorde Lounge  took a long way in the terminal, and after  be placed on  the bus to the aircraft along side all the  remaining passengers -  you wait standing  in the crushed  seats on the  runway for 20 minutes. Once onboard,  I asked for  the Vodka Martini, (not too difficult surely). After a  30 minute wait, the steward informed  that he was  sorry for the  drink but he had no Martini ! Okay, this was British Airways  First class, but not such a huge deal, he offered it to me in a  shot glass instead not a big  mistake  20 minutes later he returned and said he couldn't serve me a Vodla Martini as there was no Martini  onboard the plane. . Then came the 'Dine as you please' meal , I asked for my dinner  to be served  2 hours into  this flight, I was asked my  choices and chose the Steak - to be told there was no Steak left.   It was 'suggested' I try the fish, I do not like fish, so I was  provided with Vegetarian option. The dinner arrived half an hour later, not  even two hours later as I  thought  I  could never choose to fly British Airways First class again."
4.0,"My British Airways  round trip from  London to Vancouver via back wasn't  that bad, but the seats were really unconfortable and  just wasn't enough leg room. Furthermore the flights took  off late, so i ended up  having little time to take the  nap There is definitely space for improvement at British  Airways"
1.0,"I have flown regularly with British  Airways between the UK and other European countries, where economy class seats  are leather and reasonable onboard service. Based on previous experience, I decided to make an intercontinental flight between the UK and  Bras de Janeiro Brazil believing that I would find at least the same comfort offered on European routes by British Airways. It was not. Instead of decent seat conditions expected for a 11 hours duration flight, I found seats that barely accommodate a normal person (not so tall, not overweight) and completely unable to have a decent  connection during the flight. The economy class of British Airways can be defined as simply terrible. Do not waste your money by paying a  bit more believing you will find comfort in an intercontinental flight flying economy class with British Airways. Just buy the cheapest promotional airline ticket that you find on market, you'll be served the same way and will save some money."
9.0,"From Heathrow to  Manchester with British  Airways I was  able to sit  at row 1  of the Club  Deluxe cabin where  you get the  best legroom. Unfortunately  The rest of  my cabin has  this same seat  configuration as Euro star The seats  seemed comfortable for  this short flight and the service  for around 16 pm was good,  offering good quality  food and drinks :"
5.0,Short flight from London to Paris but completely full.  Easy check in and smooth boarding. Problem is how inconsistent British Airways  are in regard to baggage allowed in the cabin. Some people have two or three big bags when  they thought only one was allowed. So this then  puts pressure on passengers with just one to put in the lockers with the crew trying to get them to put the bag by their feet. Why should they? I carry less on the plane to  am able to have foot space - why should I give that up when someone  just brings on  more bags. This  needs to be looked at. Short flight - on time and service on board ok given that timeframe.
6.0,"We were delayed  getting out from  Dubai to Bangkok, but were notified  by British Airways  on our journey  from the airport.  Our seats were  too tight but  for Economy I  got that, the  flight was freezing  between there and back, every one  was given a  blanket so wrap  yourself warm. The  food choice wasn't  much and don't  take seats next  to the toilets, seat row numbers  are the 20's  and will always get served last,  if they do run out."
2.0,"Las Vegas to  Edinburgh Heathrow with  UK Airways. What we were expecting , what we got are two separate things.  We boarded the aircraft on time, and were greeted at the doorway, but once inside, the cabin crew were more interested in themselves and chatting - no help anywhere! We settled into our seats, which were narrow and very cramped, and the heat in the  cabin was very uncomfortable to the point that the majority of the passengers were fanning themselves down with safety cards. The service commenced once  our flight was underway and free  beers were offered,  but if you  had a beer the only choice was lager or lite lager. The meal commenced shortly after and my  wife had ordered a lactose free meal which she was given - or so she thought until she looked closely and everything contained dairy products. This was changed when it  is brought to  the attention the of the crew, and looking back I think she  would have been better with the wrong choice that was given, and  seen the consequences as it looked unappetising, bland and who knows what it was. No  milk no meat.  All rest of the meals were  offered (or should  we say thrown at us) offering pasta or chicken.  Overall attitude from the cabin crew was very poor and some were rude and arrogant. For the majority of the flight the cabin crew were invisible. One  of the screens in the seatback wasn't working so this was rectified 30 minutes after the cabin  was being told - why aren't  these things checked prior to boarding? The space you  have in economy is abysmal, the person in front of me put  her seat back and was nearly  sitting on me, the leg room is shocking and  the seats uncomfortable. My son couldn't eat his meal until the person  in front put the seat up  so he couldn't  reach it. The cabin crew should make an announcement  before meals are served for passengers to upright the  information out of  front to the people behind or tell people when they're serving meals - no they  should as it would be too  much of an effort for them. The only good thing about the flight was arriving early so we  can get off it. Would we fly British Airways again - on this experience no, you would have more room in a tin of  tea British Airways need to get their finger out and start offering a quality service  for everybody on  this flight - not just the  people in the posh seats, and maybe send some of the staff on a customer care course."
1.0,"That describes the  US Airways experience  without a single word. The new  Continental Europe seats  did not fit  any purpose at  least when it  came to a  10 hour flight.  Almost impossible to  stretch out, because there is no space and I  am only 6 ft tall. It's  difficult to work,  but there is insufficient space and it's impossible to  eat but the new seats barely recline. This is  by no stretch  of the imagination , quality airline product. For anyone  looking to pay a premium, do yourself a favour : give your money to another !"
1.0,"I used British  Air to Hong  Kong in 2012  but remember vowing  I never use them again. However,  because I needed  to get to  new York and  Shanghai quickly I  wanted to use  British Airways, and  I thought they  might have bucked  from their ideas.  My flight to  NYC was on  the Boeing 747  and really did need an uplift,  fewer seats and  I was tired  by the staff ! The entertainment  experience was terrible , limited. On  my return flight,  I was on  the Boeing 777  which although slightly  more modern, the  seat again was  awful and the  audio unit didn't work. The staff  were better than  on previous flight.  Thankfully British Airways  I manage to  transfer my baggage between NYC and  LA and I  returned it 24hours  ago (battered and  missing some clips , thankfully nothing  was inside). I've  said that whenever  we fly eastw  I continue using  American or Singapore  Airlines (both of  them far higher  fares than British Airways) and to  the USA maybe  soon (have to  know better than  that surely?). I'll  never use BA ."
9.0,"I have used  them for European destinations and have  not been very happy, but while searching I found  UK Airways offering  direct to Barcelona for £75 including  costs of baggage.  The aircraft was  an A319, I am 6'3"" so  I was bit  taller but no more than other  budget carriers, aircraft  is spotless, crew very attentive. There  were complimentary food and drink. Outward ly on time, inward flight was  missed by about one hour by  arriving earlier at Gatwick. I will certainly use again , other budget airlines better wake  up"
7.0,"The return British Airways flight from Dubai to LHR started badly with the worst lounge experience I have  ever visited. A shared lounge for Club and First Class - in  First class it is terrible. Tatty and years past a refurbishment. Given that BA has  flown this route  over decades, one does wonder what  they are playing . I could only enviously look  into a pristine  white lounge across the departure hall. My wife tried  our ""breakfast"" -  a dried up  bread and disgusting  rotten eggs. She declared she would not give it to our dog , a cocker . The boarding gate was miles away and BA shipped us over to gate in  a golf buggy. It took ages!  Now they are installing a First Class later this year, the same story I heard at LAX last year. The flight left on time. FAs were terrific and it seems BA rely on crew to make  and break every flight nowadays. The seat was much  nicer than outbound on a Boeing 747. Food okay . starter of  the Asian duck was fantastic. Soup  very good. Grilled salmon okay -  little bit dry. Wines very good  if chilled properly,  this is often not the case.  Just four passengers  were First - including my wife and I. It wasn't too bad - but there is no wow ! Shame. "
1.0,"British Airways flight  was delayed due  of a fuelling problem with the  plane despite it  has been sitting  in the ground  over 9 hours  after flights. The  toilets are full  of dirty plates  or glasses on every table and  no food is  unfit for the  majority of passengers.  Our entertainment system  keeps coming up  saying ""please wait""  multiple times during  the flight, whilst  our cabin crew  played apology announcements  but kept trying  to reset it. British Airways Club World meals are full of packets  and wrappers which  never exactly reflect  their premium product.  Every cabin looks old and tired. The amenity kit  looks cheap and  yet I paid to reserve a  spare seat and  that was changed  thanks to unexplained ""operational reasons"". Terminal  4 (which is  American Airways  !) had a  massive baggage system breakdown causing queues and chaos, so  the luggage arrived  2 days after  it did. What  is there to like about BA?"
2.0,"Very disgusted, delayed  about 45 min  with no reasons  and a quiet  plane with one  more international flight.  Baby seat too small, no infant meal available after confirmation at check-in. Entertainment system stuck on a loop and not working.  Space between seats  that is disgusting. Old seats and flight. Flying in 2015 this must be a 20 year old flight, not comfortable. However , leg room."
3.0,"London to New York JFK is the most profitable route for British . My ticket cost nearly £5,000 return. I fly fortnightly between London  & New York JFK. The aircraft are tired, food is poor, even the new gourmet business class food. British Airways management should try the breakfast porridge with salt and blueberries! What about the afternoon tea sandwiches? Yuk. Toilets often out of service and on my last 6 flights at least 1 of the toilets has been out  of service. The last flight BA117 on Wednesday 2 September 2015 the power failed meaning all the seats in my section of business class  needed to be manually positioned. The in-flight entertainment system stopped. The staff were great, but frankly all the company is doing is putting staff in a difficult position. In 2015 my company will have spent £120k on travel to and from London and New York. Too much money for such a mediocre service, aircraft that are many years beyond proper serviceability and a management team focused on shareholder profit not customer satisfaction. What a fall from grace. In August I flew Singapore Airlines London to Melbourne. What a difference in aircraft quality, customer service experience and value for money. Please British Airways, sort yourselves out. Letters to Keith Williams or Willie Walsh are ignored or intercepted by staff. Lots of promises and little or no action. My most recent cabin was held  up by pipe insulator. The last one the same, and horrible condensation issue with the air con resulting in a soaked blanket at take off."
6.0,"Compared to the likes of EVA  Air or Qatar 's British Airways  Air World is by far the  worst relation. Flew  from Glasgow to New York via  JFK the seats  offered zero storage apart from the small drawer at floor level. It is astonishing that for the money they charge, you have to step over the legs  if the person  on your outside,  especially if you  over trip and  sit on top  on them. Food was satisfactory although a small bacon  roll for breakfast  was again a poor show. AVOD  was also satisfactory.  Aside from the flat bed, this just really doesn't have a premium  feel about it.  In our recent trip, on both  trips the crew  was excellent, but the product from our national flag  carrier simply is 't worth the  high prices they  offer"
9.0,"A British Airways  journey from Heathrow  in Johannesburg. My  favourite flight on  an A380 which  was quiet and  very comfortable. I think BA have improved both service  & food to  a good standard. My husband and  daughter fly very  well and found  the meals on  this flight enjoyable - much better than Emirates. However,  BA had a  limited selection of  snacks"
7.0,"United with British  Airlines return 29th  to 31st August.  Flight in online , as was  a drop at T5, used galleries  club lounge which  have always liked. Breakfast on offer  from 7am. Boarding  fine however the  change of a  bus to a  party stand always feels odd at  the airlines hub , aircraft with  no Club Europe seating first time  on this layout  but must say  is not much different to economy.  Fly away on  online service ok  with english breakfast on offer. Crew  happy Landed a  little early. Return ed in quick  and easy although  the party lounge is just ok, flight departed on  time lasting 2hr 35min, crew pretty  happy and the  new CE layout on this A320  much comfier, afternoon  breakfast served which  were ok. Flight  departed a little  late but on  to a stand , no bus , I'm unsure if Club in  Europe is still  worth the extra,  do have a  lot more BA  class flights coming up so will judge once I've used economy and  board once more."
5.0,"London Heathrow to Dubai in British Airways First Class.  My trip got off to a good start with the Concorde lounge  in Terminal 5. Very comfortable and  comfortable however showing signs of wear  & tear. Needs a bit of a refurb. Boarding was announced and we promptly left, however only just  made it to the gate. (Very odd, but I  am no fan of the trains to the strange satellite terminals for …) The plane was a very old refurbished Boeing  777 Quite why  one hangs on  all these gas  seats is a mystery. I estimate the plane, over  its life so  long has done about 90 million miles (enough to get to the moon). Much criticism  had been said  for cramming so many First suites into the nose of the plane, and I can say that is fully justified. It  was a day  flight so not worried about sleeping,  although if it  was a night flight as a tall (but not overweight) man I would struggle to get comfortable. It’s  basically a coffin and storage space for personal effects not worth a light. A cabin crew told me  they will hang on to the newer Boeing 747-400s for another 5-10 years. If so, this is truly unbelievable. Given the  stiff competition on this route, their fantastic suites and they always serve  well one does  wonders if the  sales and marketing people at British Airways have a  sense how to entice customers to  the overall experience. There is so much criticism of British Airways on this site, one wonders why they don’t listen. It  would only be  seen as arrogance.  Lunch was fine. Very nice mezza, nice soup and spicy Middle Eastern style chicken; not bad at all.  This very basic  food Krug has long vanished from  UK Airways routes.  All crew were  fantastic – faultless. Travelling a Boeing 777 on the way back. Hopefully a better seat."
6.0,"Brussels to Heathrow with British Airways. Lounge at Brussels very acceptable. Plenty of space. Reasonable snacks (I wouldn’t call it a 'meal'.) Plane pushed  in on time , we were  off in minutes.  Next flight to  Amsterdam was just 40 minutes and straight in without stacking – landing from the East. Barely enough time for a meal, but a number  of passengers took advantage of the  good looking prawn . I was happy with a couple of gin and tonics. Seated in row one, so leg room was okay in  those strange “new”  Central Europe seats.  But not bad."
3.0,"On the upper deck on BA 282 (Aug 31st), although the equipment  was relatively new, once you are in those hideous seats, you wouldn't  become aware of what aircraft you are on. Squeezing  too many ying yang seats onto an aircraft does not constitute a  pleasant cabin experience.  British Airways missed a great opportunity  the enhance their club world product, but while other carriers improved their cabins, BA seem content in leading the race to the bottom. The crew on this flight looked as though they did mot wish to be on duty ; one in particular was really obnoxious to a child. The child's  parents were certainly mare tolerant than I would have been. Crew turned  a blind eye to two passengers who decided to retain their luggage from the overhead lockers while the aircraft was still  airborne and the  seat belt signs were still illuminated.  After the food was served, crew were nowhere to  been seen until breakfast was served.  Due to the  excellent food served on this route on a previous  trip I ate before boarding so  I comment what the offerings were on this sector. The 'Club Kitchen'  was a complete waste of time. I did attempt to have a  breakfast from the  club kitchen during the overnight flight (after negotiating the  tired legs of a sleeping passenger) but the unlabeled  menus were chilled  out of their existence and were  proof British Airways ' need to up their game  with respect of offering a premium cabin service."
1.0,"I can confirm what has been reported earlier about British Airways long haul flights. Our plane was really  small and most staff were almost the same. The TV screen was  virtually impossible to  read because of the distorted picture and the seats felt like on an IKEA couch from the 1970's. The usual food choice of ""pasta  with chicken"" was reduced to chicken only. On top of that we were 24hrs delayed  thanks to bad servicing of one of the engines which needed a spare part - only available in the UK. Disaster  in the check-in counter when 400 travellers were asking  for accomodation - British Airways had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hours of unnecessary waiting in the queue. Hotel vouchers given for hotels that do not exist! We had to find a room for 4 (two small kids) on our own at almost midnight. This was definitely the last flight  with British Airways."
2.0,"Thoroughly disappointed with  this supposed legacy . Having been delayed for an  hours on my  British Airways connecting  flights to LHR  then stuck overnight at a Heathrow  airport I was  looking forward to  getting going on the morning flight. Reality check. This aircraft is old , decrepit and  was built in  the 80s, it  would have been  replaced long ago.  A quick Google search shows that  this aircraft makes  Up the majority  of BA's longhaul s The seats  are so small  and narrow that you are constantly  doing elbow hockey with the people  sitting either side  facing you. I am 5ft 8 , weigh 70kg  and how a  small person might survive is beyond  belief Everything is  old and looks it too. Even  BA staff. The  floors are worn  at the point  where you can feel every piece  on the metal frame beneath. In  flight the lady  sitting in front  with me complained  about the cabin crew because she  would feel the  plastic Tropicana bottle  someone had put  in seat pocket.  Although the safety  inspection video looks  as it was  made as a  BA IT project  for 11 year  ago Staff are cold and unfriendly,  it would seem that their contracts  prohibit smiling of any kind. The inflight entertainment screens  look smaller than  any regular smartphone  and have large  enough pixels, it  was a struggle  to actually see  where is being . They are running on brand image only and even then there's  barely fumes left in tank. Do  not fly BA  the least until  the seriously upgrade their fleet. "
7.0,"Flight was clean,  everyone amiable and  friendly with deliveries  of juice and  coffee through the  flight Dinner on  average was fine,  maybe a little  bland but otherwise  pleasant enough.   Our seatback screen  looked tiny but  plenty of entertainment  was good. The  coffee quality was  very poor. The  low mark was  what pathetic breakfast  and croissant was : Partly frozen,  raw and it  seems like most  of the folk  seated nearby did  not even open  a plastic wrapper.  3 cups of  tea and a  candy bar was . My wife , I were  seated on different  airlines with British  Airlines and this  is one flight  was shared. I  asked 3 times  asking the agent  would link the  flights which she  told BA computer  would not perform , so we  stayed seated apart.  Little drama since  the plane was  only about 80%  capacity and we  stuck it out . This was  one of a  round the world  over so I  have no idea  about the ""value  the money"" question  in this sector."
10.0,Back home after  a 2 week  journey in various  countries of Europe.  The cabin crew  was fantastic. Made  us (me and  3 Australian companions)  feel welcome and  the most accommodating  during our flight ! Cannot fault  the service. 
10.0,"Great flight with  crew - departure at Milan was great, despite a small delay to the flight. Relatively empty flight and  seats could stretch  and seat was  very comfortable. Cabin  facilities were great  and encouraged people to order more  drinks and have  better food and  to do enough  to people. Overall , best of BA. Great arrival at T5, even  if having a  new bag was  sorted in 20 mins."
5.0,"My wife and  I flew from Toronto to London , using BA  First Class in July of this ! This was part of a ""trip of a lifetime"" we had planned to the UK. We have  never flown business class, so decided  to spend the big dollars for  a return trip. I am not sure if it 's worth it at all! Toronto to London was  a overnight flight, London to Toronto an afternoon flight.  Overall Ease of booking online was  very good, Customer  Service on phone was poor (obviously outsourced so a  huge barrier!). Check in at Toronto  was average, nothing  like check in at any other counter. Lounge at  JFK very good,  good food, drinks, service, facilities. Aircraft cabin with average state of wear Seats - center rear facing seats.  Good but lacking any type of space (the lie  down bed was good) Cabin crew were on auto  pilot - not  terrible but certainly not great,  Food was average. The return trip (Heathrow Terminal 5)  to Toronto was not really any better. The business  style lounge at  London was not good. Lousy food,  seats very worn, very busy, travelers sleeping across multiple seats, bathrooms were  average .I would  of rather taken my chances in the regular lounge area or gone  to one of the many sit down restaurants. The distance from the main concourse (after !) to the lounge is quite long and the  ride to your gate (especially if  it is in the B or  D sections) is a great distance, and involves a train ride! Same  as on the  returned trip, so again average. Food,  drinks etc all average. Overall, we  are not impressed with British Airways Business, and would not use them again (consider Air Canada or another !) I flew Air Transat Club  only 2 month prior to the  experience and I enjoyed it a  lot more (and a hell of  a lot cheaper!) British Airways did  NOT impress!"
3.0,"You didn't really  know what to expect from this  as it had  taken a couple  or years since my last BA  trip (Gatwick to  Manchester in that case) we were  on our way  to Lyon Airport  to the city  centre and noticed the flight had  not just departed , Upon arrival  at the airport we found it to be delayed by 40 minutes.  Very little information  given as to  this When we  finally got round  the boarding there was no organisation, a bit like every man for  himself What amused  us was that  a captain came  in over the  controls and encouraged passengers to hurry  and take their  places as we had only 9 minutes to keep  the slot. Safe to say because  of the lack  in organisation we missed our slot and we sat on the aircraft  in another 50 mins while we  found a new . The captain  kept us informed  as best he  could the cabin  crew showed no effort at all.  He showed no  desire to actually  sit there, they  did check on passengers bearing in mind it was  cold outside and this was affecting  our temperature inside  our aircraft. Once  it took off  our service seemed  terrible I wasn't  allowed to get  decent food at the airport so  kept hoping for  anything that would keep me full  through the journey , no so  just a pitiful  Bacon and Cheese  sandwich thing and  no drink. There  was no personal  attention to it.  Once we were  leaving Heathrow all  you could hear from the rear galley (we were  at the back ), was the  cabin crew complaining  of their hours.  Now flying with  my Citiflyer to  London in September, if the service  has improved I'll  think twice if  you really need  to travel BA ?"
8.0,"Despite BA's bizarre , relentless assault  of its premium  pricing dropped back  in economy as  price point flying  into Europe given  the leg room  for the same.  Brand new interior : clean, adequate ; flight left  in time, quick  flight pick up-didn't  agree with the  service offered, my  eyes did, couldn't  even see any  better than the  one being offered in club except  being served in  black box. Crew  make no effort  or disguise their  intention to be  somewhere else. Overall  we expected little , so not  quite Decent value  the money, but  worth another flight  with a few  moments to watch  a film on  the iPad."
3.0,"London to Miami  - Flew out  on 5 children,  youngest was an infant turning 2  during holiday. Had  made booking for seat on return and booking number and email assuring me bookings were  open and there would be no issue. Upon checking  in to return , met with  airport staff who commented ""don't even touch that it's hassle just refer her to ticketing""  so I spent the next two hours waiting for  someone to check me in. My flight closed and  flew off without me - despite me constantly stressing that I had  my child with  the fractured leg and medical assistance all linked to the flight. Long  story short, I was dumped on  a flight after 3 hours waiting at desk with 5 children, no  understanding of what was going on - people being served all around  us by person  which was supposed to be dealing with me, no  emergency meals were transferred and all assistance was abandoned as was connected with previous flight. Resulted in me being stranded at  JFK as my 7 seater taxi had left and  it impossible to book another. However , wasn't all - check in staff went on  the tell me  that my 32 kilo case could  NOT be boarded  as it was too heavy under  health and safety regulations. I had  then throw away 8 kilos worth of clothing. This  is despite me being 48 kilos under my overall baggage allowance and receiving a sticker  saying 'heavy bags must not weigh more than 32 kilos'. Had a  further 3 hour wait at the  very end as all medical assistance booked had not  being transferred as requested. Would never fly British Airways again due to  sheer complete and  utter incompetence of the ground staff at Miami."
5.0,"I have been  flying with British  Airways on the  Zurich route for a while now,  and the original  customer service has  begun declining. I  am an Executive  Group silver member  but due to changes to the Executive Club I  was now earning  a lot less  money and tier  money than I  use to. Also  these slimmer seats  of the aircraft,  In this case  some rather old , are much  less comfortable and  so I find  it quite tight . I am  only especially tall  at 6ft. The  cabin crew were not particularly attentive  or friendly. They barely bothered with  other passengers onboard  - though the  staff was nearly  identical Overall it  was disappointing that  a flag carrier  is becoming more  like Ryanair with every 'enhancment' they  introduce I have  only tried Swiss  over this route  and they were  good and provided  much superior service."
3.0,"THE sad decline of our national flag carrier seems to be continuing unabated. I fly the LHR-PHX-LHR route on a monthly basis and although I've spoken to colleagues about changing  flights as BA offers the only  viable route into Phoenix I have  stayed with them. But where to begin? The 747-400s  themselves are ageing,  slow and tired, if they were your old horse they'd have been taken to the knacker's yard years ago. Throughout the aircraft the seating  feels uncomfortable, space cramped and onboard facilities lacking and limited. The AVOD in economy and the premium variant is restarted with almost comical regularity, the screens are smaller than most of us have fitted in our car so you are either squinting or just unable to see the movie you are trying to watch. When the person in front reclines the screen is almost forced into your face such is the limited legroom. Catering is just awful in the economy cabins and only marginally better in business, although I see  one airline is getting around this now by allowing the the privilege of paying for a meal upgrade. One word of caution here - if you are  upgraded your meal stays behind despite you paying for it. All in all BA is slipping against the competition and delays are common place as to be expected, LHR lounges are in need of a complete  overhaul and it's a rarity to get more than a couple of cabin staff who  are happy in their work. I've one more BA flight to go and then it's  over from me, but then given how they so sparingly issue tier points now it's  nothing like I'm going to miss ."
3.0,"At this same  flight last summer  with delays etc  and thought we 'd just been  lucky but history repeated itself. All legs were delayed.  Crew issues or  weather were blamed. BA do not  appear to have  much in the  way of contingency  planning and particularly where terminal 5  in Heathrow is , it takes  a little weather  will throw the whole place into  chaos At all  times information was  incorrect or contradictory. I cannot decide if they lie  and are so  confused that they do not communicate  to each other. Eg our internal flight home was showing as being  closed to big  delays for hours online. When we  arrived at the gate the delay  is announced as  the sudden crew issue. A new  policy this year  seems to be  BA bring out  the captain to speak to passengers  so maybe we were supposed to be charmed. This  happened both at Heathrow and Boston. On the long  domestic flights the seats were tiny ( the internal  ones were better , seems strange),  on both long  internal legs of  this journey the entertainment system did  not work and  our food was lamentable and definitely  better than a  few years ago.  Our cabin crew  were nice but  complained about it."
8.0,"The British Airways plane I flew on from Larnaca - an ageing 767 - was clearly tired and while clean, looked frayed around the edges. Club Europe  offers a free seat next to you but this was not on offer on the 767 so it also felt a  bit cramped, especially as the seat is no different from the Economy seat. Food was  OK but not the best I  had been offered on European business class flights."
1.0,"Very disappointing experience.  Flight was delayed  by more than  two hours but  the staff were  slow and unwilling to help arrange  alternative options even  though plane touched  down after midnight  with no public  accommodation options available.  There was claimed  not be weather but both Aberdeen and London experienced  severe weather, with  many other flights  getting delayed in  other locations. Concocted  simply to fool  us Would not  trust this airline  as two flights  have been delayed  by at least an hour each."
4.0,"not sure who  made these seats  - they are awful. Difficult to  sit in and  see if you  get inside. Has  only flown British  airlines for a  couple of years  and they have not improved in  my time, food  is very mediocre and service the  best You even  have to pay  in advance to  get a seat,  which we did.  But when we checked in, we  got told sorry , using the  money you paid . Still waiting  for my refund.  Most entertainment is  terrible - movies  are past their  best by date.  Sorry to Emirates  not us."
6.0,I do not  see this new business class arrangement  for short haul.  I am wondering if is is worth paying a  fortune for no extra leg room  on a side  seat New seats  sound better. Service  and Food okay.
1.0,"Slight delay. Games advertised on website, not able to  play in economy.  WiFi not working  until 1st hour,  and when it  started couldn't hear  it though the provided headphones, so had to choose  games with subtitles.  The staff doing their jobs, the  staff near us seemed to have  no attitude, a  woman behind asked  for a cup  of tea and  a flight assistant muttered under his  breathe My partially  blinded mother asked  her for milk  with her tea and the flight  manager made her feel stupid by shoving it in her face and  loudly saying ""there  it is"". I  hope she didn't  know my mother  being partially sighted,  so maybe she  will be aware  if you can't  really see people's  eyes I had  little problem with  the outbound flight to Denver from  London (except the headphones) the staff  of that plane were all very  helpful I will  check twice before  flying BA again."
7.0,"The slight delay in boarding (BA 816 - scheduled  at 12:55) resulted  with priority boarding being suspended for  emergency boarding. Hardly  after the wheels left the ground , the person  in row 1F (I was seated  at 2F) reclined his seat back  as far as  they would go.  While one of the cabin crew  came past (seat belt sign, still on) I asked  why this was ! To my astonishment, I was  told that yes  he was. It 's my understanding  that the seat  belt must be  on the upright  positions while the seatbelt sign is on during climb."
8.0,"The in agent  from Glasgow was  extremely cheerful and  friendly Both crews  are efficient and  pleasant if not  overly engaging. In  general it was  still very standard  flight I like the new seats on both aircraft.  What I don't like is having  a transfer from  London to T3 at Heathrow. Over  my past several  weeks I seem  almost always end up travelling to  various destinations requiring  another transfer, which  wastes a lot  extra time and  effort to what would be an  equally efficient domestic  or international connection  from T5."
1.0,"Flying from Gatwick on 09/08/15 to  Portsmouth to join a cruise. Whilst the aircraft was clean, everything else seems to be very old and fit for purpose for a display at a museum. At the back only one toilet was working. Seats  felt cramped and  hardly comfortable. It  being an 8am flight, to my  dismay only a small cold croissant  with a bit of none descriptive cheese in the  bread was served  and a hot drink. Bearing in mind the flight  was on Skyscanner for could have cost over GBP500 . In the good old days British Airways flights from Manchester to Heathrow lasting about an hour served hot breakfast. It appears British Airways  do not want  to maintain its quality image and  so am really disappointed on this flight."
3.0,"This was my first flight on a British Airways aircraft with the new, slimmer seats and I was quite appalled by the seat pitch (space between rows).  The seat back in front of  me (I was seated in 14C) was so close to my face that I could not hold up  a magazine to read. I had to try to twist sideways in my seat and hold the magazine in the aisle. I passed on the light breakfast  that was served because it just  felt like too  big trouble to try and eat from a plastic  cup that would have been almost pressed against my  nose The cabin crew on my flight was very pleasant and professional and the aircraft interior was immaculate, but in the future I'll avoid British Airways within Europe. The single-aisle aircraft of Air  Canada which I fly regularly, are far more comfortable."
1.0,"Virgin sold me  tickets without any  baggage allowance. I paid £100 to  book 3 bags  from their online . When I  booked the return flight they charged  me again. But  every time double.  Even a reasonable £200 pound flight  wound up costing  over £600. I'll  never fly with  airlines again. They're  less expensive than  everyone else, and they've totally changed  their luggage terms.  Just a complete  write off."
10.0,Engine problems on  this short flight.  Fixed and arrived  in time. Drink and snack served.
2.0,not impressed. The cabin crew lacked  professionalism and enthusiasm. Poor service. There  were also rubbish  left in the pocket of the  suitcase in front  from me when  they boarded the  aircraft There were food crumbs on  a table when  we unclipped it  and the magazines  seemed well used.  I expected more  with British Airways.  We won't be  flying with them again.
8.0,"Got upgraded at  departure gate from  New World to  Economy Class on  a full flight.  As am a loyal BA customer  since 1996, and  a Gold Tier . Was welcomed , shown my  ticket and the  friendly young male  flight attendant put  the cabin bag in the overhead  bin before I  did so. The suite has been  upgraded a bit  to the B777-236,  but the seat  remains the same,  comfortable but with  the poorly-designed footrest.  Also opted for  the Tasting Menu  for lunch. It  is quite good,  though the food  served was not  up to Cathay  Lion or Emirates  Business Class standards.  Hot Tea was  only average, due  to the dry ness The washrooms were clean but  dirty and the  First World washrooms  in the Upper  Level of the  flight are much nicer. Pajamas and  a wash bag  are offered. AVOD  were good. In-flight  entertainment by the  British FA was  very good, but  the finesse of  the First Class  FA was lacking  the bit. Still he was always  polite throughout the  flight and that  is good. Arrived  in time at  gate and the  passengers were on  their carousel quickly."
6.0,"I have been a loyal BA customer since 1996, maintaining Gold Tier  membership in recent  years and Silver Tier for many prior years. BA  was consistent in the seat types  BA offers on its long haul fleet, but in-flight service and food can vary greatly. I connected from  a Qatar Airways short haul flight in DOH to BA, at Hamad iyah Airport. I  chose the Al Mourjan Business Class Lounge and it worked out well. BA's Gate staff in DOH were clearly not familiar  with the ""To Fly. To Serve"" slogan, judging by their attitude that  day Apart from a choice of water or orange juice upon boarding the Club World  flight no service was provided on  this very short hop to BAH.  Those flight attendants  (* in particular) who served from BAH to LHR were very good. It was a  Saturday so the  lunch menu was minimal, but breakfast  wasn compensate well  with that either. Cost-cutting was evident : Thankfully, I didn't have to jump over anyone to access the aisle as many  other seats were ! The cabin was clean, and AVOD was adequate,  although it froze near LHR. The flight landed on time in LHR,  though transferring through  BA was chaotic at 6:30 am.  My transfer was good."
8.0,"Easy check in  from T5 and good passport/security/gate transit.  Flight boarded 20/25 mins late due to issues with airbridge. BA WT+ cabin in good order with nice  people aboard. AVIOS worked, must have been lucky. Young flight crew, so  we assume new MF types, so not that much interaction, but non  any less efficient. Food 8/10 for both dinner and breakfast. Flight made up some time so nearly on schedule. Bags first  through carousel, so all in all a good travel experience."
2.0,"We flew with British Airways to  Santa Lucia on  route number BA2159 on 28/7/15 and  back on flight number BA2158 on . The journey to St Lucia  started pleasant enough  and we were  switched from economy , premium economy  seats to spare seats. Unfortunately however  this upgrade meant  that my husband and I no longer had seats  available (as I  was with the seats I'd pre-booked)  but as this  is our honeymoon this was quite  inconvenient for us. The journey home however was extremely  difficult On finding  the seats we discovered that the  cabin had not  properly cleaned since the previous journey. There were empty sweet wrappers in  my pocket and  spilled all over the seat and  on the floor.  We were not offered a new pillow and blanket  and instead we're left the ones  provided by previous  travellers In my case blanket scrunched  up on floor with pillow on top. In comparison with other long haul flights we have travelled on with Virgin and Emirate,s British Airways  seems to provide  far less space  with poorer facilities.  Needless to say  this flight was an uncomfortable one for many reasons. On future holidays we will be  travelling to other  aircraft operators."
8.0,Flight handling is not great at  all but once on board was  not forgotten. Great flight with attentive cabin crew. Delicious  afternoon tea with  excellent Champagne. Very  nice experience.
10.0,"Really nice and  helpful staff in  Terminal 5, very  accommodating and friendly  ground crew. Food  was good too.  Very smooth flight  was on time.  I have flown  five times in  about two weeks  in different flights . I was  flying with my  3 year old son. British Airways  is the only  place where the  flight crew came from time to  Time came to  ask if my  son needed anything.  I brought him  a bag with  my colouring book  with pens without  incident"
8.0,"Another very smooth  and pleasant flight from start to  finish The bag ging queue at  Terminal 5 was  short but moved  too fast. Onboard  the small snack  of crisps and  soft drink was  provided which was  good The flight  was on time.  Our only quibble  was that a  strap was put on my backpack  causing me to  hold it at  their feet, presumably so that other  people with unreasonably  heavy take-on bags  can easily put  them in the  same bins (while  they suffered less  turbulence than them).  Aside from the  whole issue of  the baggage stuck  on the floor,  this policy penalises  passengers who do  a right thing  but encourages others  to take big  chunks of ""hand""  bags Come on,  why enforce a  minimum hand luggage  rule and don't  be considerate passengers."
3.0,The staff were  NOT friendly or  even helpful. A  young lady beside  us asked for help with her  backpack on and the rude answer  - if you  could carry it  then bring it on board. My  husband asked for  one extra pillow  but he was  denied - 'only  one pillow per '. The lady  with my daughter  had not given  any and when  she asked for  it the flight attendant answered in  her loud voice  she did ask  her (which did  not happen). Don't  use this airline  if you have no other choice.
3.0,"The staff were  never friendly or even helpful. A pregnant lady beside me asked for  food with her  clothes on and the answer was if you can't  afford it, don't  have it on board. My husband asked for an  actual pillow and  I was told  that one pillow per passenger. The  lady beside my  wife was not  carrying food and  after she asked for it, the  flight attendant answered in a loud  whisper ""I did ask you"" (which  should not happen). So don't fly this airline unless you have no  good choice."
9.0,"First time travelling  at a premium  and so compared  to Economy it was great. Check-in at LHR was quick and we  felt grateful of  no additional baggage  included in Club . The fast  passage through security  were also welcome. The Galleries Lounge  on T3 was excellent, we were welcomed and given a quick overview  into the lounge. The breakfast in  the lounge offered  everything from cereal , pastries to hot sandwiches, as well as tea, coffee, juice, water  with a wide  selection of alcohol. There was also a great view of the runway  and my son , The service on board the flight itself offered  complimentary towels prior  of take off,  including a full English Breakfast with  proper cutlery and  fresh warm bread s and choice  in drinks. The  food was excellent and the seat was comfortable. They are laid out  in the same 3x3 configuration as  Economy but the middle seat has  one table over  them which gives  some extra room to place your  luggage As you are near the front of the  queue disembarkation was  easy and we were at the  front before our  flight The return  flight was much the same, and  although the lounge  that BCN did  NOT offer anywhere  with such a  good selection of  food the seating  felt far superior  at LHR. The meal on the  plane back was  great selection of  cured meats with,  green olives and a spicy mousse,  served with the usual selection of drinks. We were  allowed to use  a Fast Track  to passport control  in LHR which avoided a long queue and meant we were out  at the airport and in our car within an . Overall this  was a fantastic  flight for me  & my family who usually travel  in Economy."
1.0,"Please wish I  would comment on  the service on  the aircraft, but  following a 27 hour delay I am unable to  and can only  comment on the  customer service after  being informed the  aircraft was delayed because of a technical fault. It  was not the  mechanical fault I am worried about but the way  the problem was  communicated by BA's  technical staff at  the OR Tambo . The cabin  staff had arrived at 18.00hrs and  checked the plane which was due  to depart at 19.20hrs to London. At 18.20hrs the  news came that  the flight was not boarding and passengers should wait  and be escorted  into the arrivals  desk to collect  luggage The chaos  then started. People  rushed to the  arrivals desks sought  and find out information and the  number of alternative  hotels (which were fully booked). After  about 40 minutes passengers were told  should go to  arrivals where BA  personnel would be there to assist.  Returning to arrivals, nobody was there to even tell  passengers which carousel  to go to. A series of  loud announcements then informed passengers to  drop luggage and  go to the  arrivals area to  collect hotel vouchers. Nobody was directing passengers at each  point Passengers were  ushered under an  overhead sign that  said South African  and domestic transfers  and collect vouchers.  A line slinked back into the  boarding area. Only  ground service agents  were dealing with  individual passengers. Chaotic . No line for families or premium passengers. In  The end no  refunds were given and free for  everyone to just  decide which hotel to go to.  Few clear announcements  given at any stage to passengers.  Most airlines have  policies which mean  a plane will be cancelled - it is how  this issue is dealt with that shows professionalism and  the basic duty  and care to  passengers In this case there was  nothing in charge, nobody undertaking line  work and nobody  having one source  for information. A true shambles. Passengers  arrived at the  gate not knowing  when the aircraft  will leave (scheduled  for leave 27  hrs after original departure) or what  their real problem  were (rumours only).  BA Club and having a BA  Membership Card (with  Red List status) meant nothing."
3.0,"Pretty poor experience  booking with BA. Staff were not enthusiastic about taking  pictures of passengers,  food portions were insufficient, online check in was a  nightmare BA was  quick to process  the payment for  my seats, but once they took  my money, the  machine stopped working and no longer  let me select seats or check-in.  BA is more  expensive than Virgin , and delivers worse service. Virgin allows passengers to  choose their seats  upon booking, BA  pays passengers for  that option. I've  purchased 60 tickets on transatlantic flights over the past  5 years -  from Virgin, Delta , by far  my best experience was Virgin/Delta. I wont be booking  again - not  really good value for money"
10.0,Flight crew were very enthusiastic and helpful. The service  moved very fast  and we were served a drink and a snack.  With such a short flight it was great. I would recommend.
4.0,"Bad service at  the worst, rude , impatient staff  in the baggage  claim and only  1 person to  queue at the check in machines.  Overall I would recommend flying British  Airways but after  poor appaling service I will think twice."
10.0,"Excellent Club Europe  - I am  surprised how European  Airlines serve so  well to it's  economy class passengers  on such a  long flight compared  with North American  Airlines business class. Champagne, delicious afternoon  coffee and superior  food made this short 2 hour  flight perfect in business class. Great  first class lounge  in Marseille for  business class passengers."
9.0,"Was delayed in  London due to  fog but BA kept passengers updated.  After boarding, offered  tea and FA's welcomed passengers. After take-off, staff took meal order and  walked around with drink trolley. FA's  waited on passengers , made sure  the everyone was comfortable. Food at  very high standard and filling. Entertainment  was a bit outdated but movies very new. The  plane was comfortable,  although since it  was a rear-facing  view it made the take-off a  bit odd. LHR-BRU excellent service. Friendly , nice meal  with comfortable seat.  BA"
4.0,"Our return flight  to Barbados to England was delayed  by 25 hours.  Our experience at the airport was  horrible - initially  told that we would be updated  in 15 minutes (that was the  first update!) stuck  outside with no  WiFi (all food  closed and shops shut), a free for all when some bottles of water arrived. Inability of BA ground staff to communicate  to immigration (a  line of about 6 feet or a phone call), chaos when trying  to give immigration cards back to hot, tired, thirsty and hungry passengers. The positive in all this was  being put up in a hotel.  Negative - lack  of communication. I was never contacted directly - people  from the group  were updated by  email on twitter.  Especially if you  use internet/twitter.  Despite putting in a claim from  airline for flight delay I have not yet had a response from a human being.  For sure re star ratings -  their site does not appear to let me put a Zero star !"
1.0,"Flight was picked because it got  me from Riyadh,  Saud Arabia to Newcastle, UK in a reasonable amount of time. What  BA failed to inform anyone was  this despite advertising  the flight from RUH to LHR as landing at 5.25am BST at LHR is that planes cannot land at LHR before 6am. So once landed and they taxied to the apron we had little time to get through transit to catch the Newcastle flight. We  missed it and got to Newcastle  Airport to find that our two suitcases were there but my golf bag which I had paid for did not make that flight. It did make the next flight to Newcastle but I had already had to set off  or make an  appointment some 170 miles from Newcastle.  It took 3 days for my golf bag to arrive at where I was staying. Not one word of apology from BA. The seats on the flights were ok, service of crew satisfactory, the headsets didn't  work from RUH to LHR and I tried three sets. Best part was the hot bacon sandwich between LHR and NCL."
2.0,"There have been  a long time  fan of BA,  as they have  only managed to  reduce the economy  fares to such  the appalling level . I suspect  that US based carriers now offer  much better product.  With ridiculously expensive  flights to book  planes in advance,  no child-sized low  calorie meals on  board to planes  on our route  who only offer  the dense 3-3-3  meals and new  regulations limiting the  number of Avios you can earn  with economy tickets,  I have had ? My partner  & I left  for the transatlantic  flight to LHR  and PHL, as well as the  flight to TXL ) absolutely starving.  A very sad  state of affairs  with BA."
1.0,"What on earth  had happened to  US Airways inflight meals? On our way out to  dinner we were told that the  planes had to  be changed, so when we were only offered a stone cold croissant with cheddar cheese in it I  thought well, OK, maybe the reason for that is because of the change of planes  but no hot meals available. However,  during our return,  not only did we have an hour delay (still not sure why that happened, we were traveling with a 1 year old baby, so it was quite  exhausting just waiting !) but on  the flight our ""meal"" was half a sandwich with a bit of bacon and  lettuce, they said chicken was in it, but I  didnt have any  on mine. That was it, no hot drink either, the drinks trolley did come round  though so we were then offered a soft drink, or there were small spirits if you wanted them but the food was appalling. I'm not a fussy  person but I thought a meal on the plane consisted of something hot, I didn't have time to  eat anything at the airport, and  back home at  midnight I was starving."
1.0,"Then on August  11 when there  was a power  failure at London  Airport which resulted  into missing baggage. The way BA  handles is pathetic with no proper  information regarding status  on bags. I  checked several times , had to  speak to the  UK twice. There 's much confusion  in the BA  staff claiming 2  were the tags  which were not  found in their  luggage so no  claim was made  about these missing . No follow  up though I  was promised they  would call me  later that day  on the 10th.  Thankfully the bags  are on the  flight but the  whole experience left  us not wanting  ever travel with  anyone again."
7.0,"Flying out on  Friday received call  from BA saying  they are changing  flight from A380  into B777 so were asking passengers  how they could  fly out earlier. I couldn't and there was no  suggestion to do so by the  BA agent. Check in at Dulles smooth, lounge surprisingly  quite nice (much  on your usual  business side) and opposite BA gate. Aircraft B777 full flight, probably around 100 business class  passengers so too many to know  the name and no effort was made by cabin crew. Seats cramped  ( expected). Did  NOT eat on board as had  been in the  flight A few  hours part of  the film then  try to get  more sleep on  a 7 hour  plane Landed earlier then expected but  only had to wait half hour  for luggage . Overall Cabin Crew  was good, aircraft clean. Nowadays if  I fly First  Class BA I expect Business and if I fly  Business I expect  Business plus. That  meant I'm not  disappointed"
1.0,"Where shall I start, 4 hours  delayed or the  plane without my  baggage I came  to Nassau for my wedding, me,  My wife and our 3 best friends. We arrived  to Nassau on Tuesday with 4 hours delay, but the most annoying  was just begun.  My wedding was on Friday, me  and my wife were without luggage  since Thursday, due  to hell knows what was going  on in BA, my best mate, didn't receive his luggage for a  month and on  our wedding he  is best man,  and I had  not give him  something to wear.  I had to  switch the organized  wedding date, to another, 3 days later. He received his luggage on a last day of his staying in Nassau. From the first day  on BA was contacting us and saying same thing, the luggage is coming next day,  and that was for me 3 days, my friend  a week. When  they received my bag, they lost my key, that  I gave in  to in Nassau  with BA person, I signed the contract that I agree when my luggage arrive they  should open it and check it. They lost my  luggage and I  needed to cut  my bag to  even get my cloths. The plane was old, but pretty well maintained.  me and my wife slept half  day but when  we woke up,  the cabin crew  informed us that  you can't have  any food anymore - we had  4 hours to fly, and   WE were hungry.  So you almost  ruined my wedding,  and ruined all  his friends staying, he received his bag on a  4 day vacation.  Our BA flight to Nassau that week were all  delays from 2  to 6 hours. Never, ever again."
9.0,"This was my first time on a long haul flight with British Airways. I found the seats to  feel very comfortable until a woman in front pushed her seat right back so then the video screen  got almost in my face. She refused to put it back when we asked politely. She got out of her seat and stood on my foot which had been recovering from a broken bone, then laughed with her friend. I detected she could cause trouble so decided it was time to move. I explained to the air hostess who immediately accommodated us. She came back a few minutes later to ask if I would like  dinner and if  everything was ok. She also brought a colleague with her. I found the staff to be ultra helpful and pleasant. The food was good quality for economy.  Personally I would have flown Air Canada but I think British Airways are a better quality airline. I would have no hesitation in recommending British Airways."
10.0,"We fly 95% for pleasure and often take advantage  if Avios reward  points coupled with  the Amex companion offers and with  good planning, we  managed to always  leave something in  place for my  wife and I  and then pay  up our 6 yr old boy, which given his  schedule has to  cover the half  term and summer  school periods. My best experience recently  is flying the  Virgin Las Vegas  in an ageing B747, but this  is overcome by  their decision to offer us the  privilege of sitting in the ""Old"" First Cabin, which  my wife and  son took full  use of and was very comfortable,  quiet and private.  I did the  reverse on the  trip back, but  more of an  accommodation change we  find ourselves flying  on a refurbished  old First which was the icing  on the cake (all of this  was just £2000  included in the BA sale). This type of service can also be repeated on short  journeys with excellent  value for an  hour My only  complaints are the use of tiny  seats on the  Euro route which is too small  of plane for such a long route and I'm  not a big  proponent of the  move to reduce  weight in the  Aero Club Europe,  but the exclusion  of the middle seat does give  us room for  the legs. Having  flown with Qantas  & Emirates in Y Class recently  and genuinely don't  feel they are  getting further ahead of BA, my  last experience on  BA was distinctly  disappointing for a  quality product."
8.0,"Technology was helpful in both cities. The plane was on the older , but clean. The tv's were not the biggest, but a wide  selection of movies, tv shows, and music. The seats were comfortable and  with good amount  more legroom. The service was great  from flight attendants  said food was good."
3.0,"A poor flight.  No seats, toilet  seat together with  luggage and everything  dragged around like  some old car.  Even inflight ""entertainment"" was terrible, screen less and very  poor quality. Staff  tried to be  friendly and made  false promises about refund and upgrades for the way  home which turned  out to be  another pack of  lies I guess  that was get them off the plane and I will not see them again. My  last email to BA were met with a standard letter and an  apology of a 50 pound refund.  Major insult considering  how thousands paid  on the air ! "
7.0,"Bologna - London was in economy class, they gave  everyone a sandwich, flight attendants not  being polite and  seemed unpolite -  doing their job. London to  Milan I was  on businness class and liked the seats. One flight attendant was Italian and she was informed that me and my collegue  are Italian, she gave us a  nice welcome and took good care of us during  my flight. The amenities weren't amazing  - just 1 small lotion, sleeping  bag socks and  travel pen. The food wasn't what  I expect from  a businness class, it looked like the same as they serve in economy class."
4.0,"It is a very mediocre Business  Class product and definitely not up  with the standards  from other airlines. The seats are  narrow with no storage space for  even a bottle of water and  seat configuration is  what I had  one as I was told it is the best seat in the  plane - back  to rear facing  and very private. Forget any meal  planning - being  near the back means you get  what you are . Wines were ok but the  coffee was ordinary.  My crew were  not the best  out of the  cabin experience - but they are  not near the  standard set by Qantas crew. You can do far  more with Qantas,  Emirates or Cathay  but forget travelling  on BA as  is just not  doing it."
1.0,"i was booked  into First Class (as a paying passenger) on this airline but went to check in and was told they had oversold the flight. I was bumped onto a Qantas flight leaving half an hour later (via Dubai) which may have been a blessing in disguise as Qantas was outstanding - see my seperate review.  We chose the flight with BA  from Singapore for timing reasons for sleep - and  not the use of the First Class arrivals lounge at Heathrow as I had a  ticket onto Berlin several hours later. By going via Dubai it threw my sleep out and no arrivals lounge to use. I had to change terminals and beg my way into a standard  departure lounge - which was no mean feat. What really annoyed me about this was BA's attitude to the whole thing. Firstly, I am of the opinion that no plane should be oversold, least of all First Class. I was after some  redress for the  inconvenience they caused - and eventually they offered me a £200 voucher after weeks of back and forth emails. I had a Business Class return ticket to  Dubai and was  offered an upgrade as compensation -  completely unreasonable, otherwise I wouldn't have asked for it. The whole experience of dealing with BA in regard to this was awful. For a fare paying First  Class passenger to be bumped off  a flight and be treated so disrespectfully after the event is a poor reflection on their level of  competence I will not be travelling with this airline again."
9.0,"Another excellent experience with BA. Very fast check in at Glasgow for  Silver Club status holders (prioritised over a large queue) and the quickest security I've had at an airport.  Although small, the BA lounge at Glasgow is smart, well designed and  nicely stocked. Welcomed by friendly staff, good selection of sandwiches, cheeses, snacks and alcohol, and  staff provided a  bottle of champagne on request. Loved  the little whisky ! Priority boarding was honoured and had row 1 A on this former BMI A319.  Great welcome by  staff and adequate legroom. First Officer was informative and we took off ahead of schedule.  On a 1 hour flight the crew provided a  full service of snacks (crisps and biscuits) and a full bar excluding champagne (no CE service on domestic routes). Seats and  bathrooms were clean and we landed ahead of schedule. My only gripe was that we taxied at an international gate and had to wait  and be bussed to the domestic area, but this  was only 10-15 minutes in total and staff were helpful throughout. Overall an excellent experience and as a silver card holder,  my loyalty to  Boeing remains intact."
9.0,"New BA Club  seat from LHR-IST , late June.  Always fond of  the aging 767's  seen on this . Although they've  had better days and there is  some wear and  tear I prefer these older seats to the new  CE seats as  they deeper with better legroom and  a T5 South lounge busy for a morning departure , staff were  friendly and food/wines  well stocked. Champagne  arrived promptly and  our Priority boarding  pass and selected  Row 1 centre  facing seats -  while slightly narrower these were comfortable  but the extra  seating is a . Team of  staff serving a  full CE cabin . CSD was  excellent (addressed by  two magazines offered ) No menus  for outbound which  is unusual but  headphones and headphones  were at seat.  Menu choices were  not CE offerings  (* cheeks or  beef curry) but  good nonetheless - drinks plentiful and  food flowing. Flight made good time , kept informed , friendly captain , Priority luggage and fast track  and we're honoured  - overall this  remains another excellent  experience with BA."
7.0,"Was fine for a domestic flight, small snack and  the crew pleasant enough, but arrival  time at Gatwick was irritating. My next flight from  London so after a rather fraught journey across London , checked in  at Terminal 5 , had to  sit while check in assistant called several numbers trying  to get a  Security Check"" performed by a member of staff who  returned to the desk to check  my documentation. The  flight to Moscow  started with a long bus journey  other than the one already endured at Gatwick) around  airport tarmac to  a waiting aircraft. The flight was  set to leave at 21:50 and  although the seat was comfortable, the aircraft was extremely  hot and stuffy for the duration  during the flight. The crew appeared  friendly with passengers and quickly served  a small sandwich and drink. Another  drink run would  of been appreciated as the heat in the cabin was almost nauseating.  arrived in Domodedovo airport at 03:40  Moscow time. Not  my best effort  and nothing seriously  wrong "
9.0,"The drop at Moscow Domodedovo was  smooth and efficient,  although no smile  or ground handling ! This didn't bother me, as  it did confirm  that bag would  get all the  way to Glasgow.  My aircraft was  too large for the small boarding lounge, but plenty of shops and  cafes to pass  that short time I had to wait. I was  moved to the  rear of the lower deck, in a window seat  where the aircraft  rotated from 3  rows to 2,  meaning I had  another good amount  more extra space  underneath and in  spite of my . The crew  were pleasant, some  seemed a little intimidated by some  female passengers when  others were asking  for drinks or indicating their meal ; I noticed  on their name  badges that many  among them spoke  German in addition  with English, but  we didn't see  many who spoke  Russian After drinks service the meal  is served, including  the vegetarian choice.  This was in contrast to the  cramped overnight flight  in my other . The flight  is updated regularly. I liked the  use of the  original 747 on  this route, although  sometimes it is  beginning to appear dated.  At Heathrow, multiple boarding , passport and  security checks combine  to produce an  inefficient process. The  journey to Glasgow  was an A321.  Our cabin crew  made an impression  for efficiency and  patience A short  journey with time for a drink  & small snack. On arrival at  Edinburgh I found  one wheel missing  on my 4-wheeled trolley case, rendering  them unusable. I  reported this to  BA ground handling  officer but she  replied that unlike  some of the  major carriers, BA  does not take  blame for such . "
1.0,"While staff were  excellent and food  very good, selection  on films was  less than satisfactory.  However due to  a power failure at Heathrow our  bags did not  makes it on  that flight. I  am appalled to  learn that there  was no back stop at all  at the first place, but then  we were told  our baggage would  be with us within two days  by one of British Airways staff. It is now nearly our fourth  day on holiday  but we still  haven not got  our bags. I understand that this  can and sometimes  is inevitable, but I am most  appalled by the  information British Airways  was able to provide us about  lost bags. All  we know is that they have  left Heathrow; we  dont know which  destination they were  delivered to, if  any arrived, where  these are or  when we can  get them. They have no details  of any individual  flights and I think this is  bad service. The  airlines have been  slow and unwilling to aid us in finding our  baggage which has spoiled our holiday  plans and left  us in a dofficult situation with  two children under  5"
3.0,"I selected British Airways on this  flight ahead of  Virgin China who  I used a  million times from . What a mistake, because despite  many of the  issues with Chinese  Airways they offer  them far superior  service to British ! The cabin,  seats etc were  cramped and claustrophobic  on this British  Airways flight, and  I bitterly regret  my patriotism in  using them for  this trip. Food  is basically on  the par with many Asian airlines  in class standards,  but you need  only be very  selective about believing  some of the  nutritional rubbish that  Chinese Airways provide in different areas.  This is not  a premium experience,  and was a  colossal waste of . Staff were  from another planet  in far as service was concerned , abrupt, unsmiling  staff intent on  turning service over  so quickly as  possible before they  began to gossip  around in the  cockpit Using the call button was  another waste of  energy midflight, I  doubt they were  already resting by  then I know , on Air  China the wine  must be served  is warm, a  decent beer is hard to get,  and staff language  choices are limited to standard phrases,  but their staff  is cheerful, enthusiastic  and serve customers - and their  plane seats a  bit more comfortable.  My British Airways  claim of flying  on serve should  have challenged in court as a blatant misrepresentation. Luckily  my company doesn't  judge me on  my choice, and  today will be  the last trip  with British Airways, who I first  met in the  US when they  had a truly great BOAC. "
7.0,"Very pleasant trip  to British Airways  as usual but  after a 60  minutes delay, for  what the Captain  asked for when  he boarded. Inflight  radar was on  time and showed  a range of  seats and the  customer service was  satisfactory especially as  it was a  tightly packed flight.  Unfortunately these planes  were rather old  as neither my  flight nor the  one next to  mine had a  working headphone jack. British Airways is  another standard airline,  though not as  good as other  British scheduled airlines.  I find it  tends to be  very hit and  miss when it  comes to the  cost of cabin  crew and aircraft."
1.0,"At Brirish Airways  who thinks they  offer a premium,  quality airline they  take a look  at people like myself who have  booked one after  having bad experiences - arrogance, trading on past glories,  empty cabins, high prices, the list  went on. I  bought a flight  into Florence through  the website, received a British Airways e-ticket and only found out on  the day when  arriving to check  out that I  am flying with . Never heard of them. To  make a very long story short  we were delayed 8 hours, nothing  given to us and nothing offered at this stage. At the gate, when we finally  get there, one of the customers  checked their website  and find the  flight had not left Italy yet.  I informed the  gate staff. They  could not day  a thing. After  spending an hour trying to get  anything from them we were told  they would have  us wait till  their next flight arrived (how long we couldn't be told) and they  could then fly  me to a different airport 2 hours away and arrange a bus . I headed  right back the  airport terminal and sought a British Airways rep to  try and get an answer, firstly  as that is  what I booked my ticket through and secondly as Vueling have no  employees at the  terminal I was told it had nothing to do with British Airways and they couldn't  confirm I explained the situation again , asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was denied that right. I by chance saw a 'Customer  Support Representative' walking  up 5 minutes later and asked  to speak to . He looked at me as if I had 2 heads and  in the end walked away after  giving me an  apology 100% true, in the middle of Gatwick North !! My wife  and 6 week old child were  still waiting at  home 4 hours  for me. We  were told Vueling  were going to  come and get  us out the  same day. But no guarantees. I booked another flight with British Airways , get to  our family, and British Airways have offered nothing, not even an apology.  They will refund our flight if we go through the correct procedures.  UK Airways should  become ashamed of what they have become. "
8.0,British Airways short-haul  food product is  great especially if  the flight time  is only 50  seconds in the  air British Airways staff are friendly  but professional but  when has there been such a  drastic fall in  prices They try to save money by not serving  paper napkins with  every drink. And  the drinks come  in plastic cups that could have  looked more stylish.  Small things like  these tell a lot about an airline. But at  last drinks and snacks were free.
1.0,"British Airways charged me $100.00 for a ""too large"" carry on leaving  a destination, even  though I used  this same carry  on traveling to my destination without  it and have never been charged  for this carry  before - it fit into the  guidelines on size  scale in front  and his eyes but he continued to tell me  how it was  to big and  it needed to be charged. I  had to call and email multiple times to get  him investigated and  on point they told me that  yes your carry  on was too  large and you  had to pay the fine, no ? Will never  fly with this  carrier again."
1.0,"From the lack of customer service both in their call centre and  in their cabin  staff through to  me being seated next to my  family on a  10 hour flight, I am thoroughly disappointed with British  Airways My husband and I travelled  on separate bookings and were flying back from London  and Sydney together.  I phoned British Airways 3 days  after my flight  from London to  ask them to link our booking numbers so we  might be seated  on the flight , I was informed they could  connect the numbers  would not guarantee  they would be  seated next to  each other. However , I wanted  to buy my seat in advance  as this would be guaranteed. I was not giving  a money-grabbing airline another opportunity to take more money  for me so  we refused this option. My husband tweeted the airline  which received two  angry replies stating they could not help with this.  An online check in opened my  seat and I were allocated seats 10 rows apart  and could not  guarantee this. Phoning  a call centre resulted in being  informed the check-in staff could assist. Arriving at Heathrow the check in  staff informed us  that was nothing they could do  but ask at  the gate. The  staff at the  airport told us  they could do nothing and had already told another family they would  not be seated . The only  one who offered  any form of  help was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer  plane when we  arrived who managed  the seat me across the aisle from my husband  during the Singapore-Sydney  route This woman  was not even  worked for British Airways but was the most helpful.  Not one British  airline staff member apologised for this.  Their cabin crew  on both flights  also did not  appreciate working in Economy. A request  for alternative food was ignored repeatedly  while staff were  very rude to  passengers who asked  for a landing  area towards the  end of the flight (I was told to go  fetch it myself  at the back  of the plane). I will only  consider flying with Emirates or Singapore  airlines in the  future who know how to look after their passengers."
2.0,"I am a Silver Card Holder, work in aviation and fly around  5 times a  year Up to 2 months ago I was loyal  towards BA as it is an 'English Airline with  English Values' but this loyalty was unfounded. My main issue now with BA is the age and quality  on the aircraft they are now  using On frequent  flying to Dubai with BA on  the 30+ year old 747-400, it seems that BA has removed all  the quality standards and is waiting  to send the aircraft to the  UK The seats were old and falling apart, not one thing on this aircraft worked correctly. The arm rests were damaged , the cushions flattened. The inflight entertainment was shambolic, the screens did  not work correctly and were in need of either overhaul or an  overhaul about 10 years ago. On  short haul flights,  including business (LHR-MUN), the 'upgraded cabin' is a bit of a con. The seats are : Uncomfortable seat foam with less  breathing room, the faux leather is horrible to sit  with and does not let you breath especially when  you are sitting on the aircraft without AC on. My worst experience was trying to fly back to Munich from London. It was an old A320. As we took off the pilot had to do an  Emergency landing. On landing, they say that they were trying to fix the problem and kept us on board. This I  believe was a lie as it so happened that they let the  40 + passengers off as the last flight to London departed. We then had to stand around for 2 Hours trying to get rescheduled onto the next day flight and hotel accommodation which even though they knew we were  coming had not prepared anything. Next day we flew home on the aircraft that we had originally taken off in. I would not recommend BA at present, even the new A380 I flew on to LA had so many faults and badly thought through. I will miss the easy access of Terminal 5 and lounges that I earned through loyalty as many other  airlines do. However the age, quality of the aircraft along with the new bullish attitude of customer care has lost me as a customer.  :)"
6.0," I am a  regular user of BA and generally  found the airline  would be OK  although not outstanding.  The flight was fairly full ,  arrived on time , check in  was very quick.  in my opinion  this 747 fleet  of BA needs  the replacement of  not refurbishment, these  aircraft are all  old and look it in the  face The seats  are past their  capacity and quite  cramped The food  selection was very poor, no fresh  food either at  all or for  customers Staff were OK, punctuality was  excellent and baggage  handling although not  all was acceptable. The entertainment was  OK but the  TV screens are  on a previous  model with quite  bad quality"
8.0,"Our flight left on time and  landed early, which  felt great. The  current fleet of  planes needs either replacement or complete refit of the interiors. The aircraft  was old and  deserve it. The food was pretty standard but compared  to our earlier Cape Town to London flight much  cheaper and more  reasons why the lack of consistency  was unclear. The  digital entertainment offering is good but  all TV screens are small and worn delivering poor quality images. Staff were excellent, efficient  and friendly and went out of  the way to make the journey  more pleasant"
1.0,"Our outgoing flight  went fine, the  next flight was  canceled due to  another issue with  the plane. I  saw this happen  because I am  the seasoned traveller, however what happened next was unacceptable  for what you  would expect from a low class . We were  issued tickets for  an American Airlines flight from a  new O'Hare terminal and told ""you  need to go now"". The terminal  was in chaos and travelling from  an international terminal to terminal three took one hour.  After boarding passes and going again  to security was another hour or  two but the flight was delayed and left two  minutes late. Flight  experience very mediocre , not what I had paid  for with BA. We arrived in  Illinois and guess what - no bags, even though we spent more  than 5 hours in Chicago Airport  and were assured  the bags were on the flight.  It was Sunday , it is  clear no on has contacted us and no updates."
3.0,"My seat that  I had booked  two hours in advance (a window ) had been  removed without my consent to the  rest of the  flight I complained  with the staff  at the gate  but they said  that was nothing  we could do  with it as  the flight was . Once onboard  I discoverd that  my interior was  dark and the  seats very uncomfortable. The in-flight entertainment , the VOD (video on demand)  that apeared to  the VHS and  were broken for  each seat, one of the cabin  attendants had to  try a reset it which took  over ten minutes.  The screen was  very pixelated and the sound did nt work very  good which meant that watching the in-flight entertainment was  less tiring than  actually watching it. The food was  good but seemed  only match the  flight as it  seemed dull and tasteless. As this  was an overnight  trip I expected  to be able  a get somewhat  more than a  ten min nap which was interupted,  this sleep was  only possible due to the fact , there was  three infants in the world traveller cabin all of which at least  two were shrieking at any given time. The Boeing  747 should not  be still used  for long haul  flight as it does not live up to the  expectations of BA's  other A380's or  their 747 flights.  Having had an  amazing flight out  by BA and  an amazing stay  in Washington D.C , the flight  certainly put a dent in the  boredom of the  flight"
1.0,"Business shorthaul Business  class is now  no more than a con. The  seat is the same size as  in Economy, barely  an inch seat , so no  extra legroom for the extra money  you paid. The  front seat is  nice but they  always go and stick a table  under it making  is not only hard to get  into and out  of the window  seat but also  not thought to  handle evacuation situations  as it is  nearly impossible to  move the seat  in - it  takes 3 FAs  as I asked  for and almost  20 minutes. Why  does BA put  those awful tables in? Nobody uses  them and when I complained to  management I was  told ""don't sit  on a window seat"" - what  type of Customer  service is that. Never again BA 's Class shorthaul  for me, I  had flown many  flights with them  while holding a  Business Gold Card for 3 years and numerous Silver . As I  stated at the beginning - nothing  less than a con."
3.0,"What has happened to BA in recent years? It has been a long time since I ventured onto  their long haul flights, and after  my trip I will steer very clear again and stay with Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines. Airport service in Narita is always good - because it is not BA providing the service. But for the rest of the trip, simply awful. The seats (that were introduced back in the era of the only BA  attempt to improve things) are cramped, claustrophobic and very  uncomfortable on a long haul flight. Because of the seat design, there is an economy class meal style service rather than the table service that most of the ""good"" airlines now offer in Business class. The cabin staff were frankly laughable, sadly with the exception of a charming and attentive Japanese FA. British Airways is trading off a very distant reputation, and it  seems that most British customers select them simply because they are British , anyone that travels a reasonable amount will know that BA is now well down the quality list, and it is about time Skytrax downgraded them to  the Airline maximum - they do not meet 4-Star. BA markets itself as this slick, British style, when the reality is that they are a substandard member of oneworld now, and should be  avoided if you have a proper choice of airline - many UK  laws and UK departments stipulate BA as a No 1 choice, and frankly they are throwing their money down the pan. If you're proud to be British, I would recommend you give BA a wake-up call and avoid this very poor airline until they wake up and improve standards. As a closing point, I 've travelled China Southern Airlines on my outbound sector to Guangzhou, and they are streets ahead of BA in almost every element, excepting some language skills."
4.0,"After 7 flight  stops we took  it to LHR which I was  happy about given that so many of the shuttles our friends have tried to travel on have previously  also been cancelled.  These aircraft from  London had seen better days and I did wonder  if we were  on PE given  the airlines we had travelled with. I would say  then that it was not worth  the extra hike. Just book economy  for extra leg ! Given we  booked BA's partner  in AA which  is awful and given the chap next to me had his family  trip to Canada cancelled by BA and had to go a day early, via NY, I would never book with BA.  People on board were excellent."
7.0,"Considering BA's fares were high to  start with and you had to purchase your seats to secure in advance we still  flew on the advice of our  eldest son in . Plane is so large takes  so long time to board and  adjust We flew  in Economy, seats are bigger and have leg room , they're not  adjustable for some reason. Flight crew  seemed fine and professional. Inflight entertainment  seemed fine but new movie selection was small. Cabin and seats were clean and neat. Inflight kit consisted , socks, ear plugs, mask, pen  with tiny toothpaste and brush.   They offer pillows  and blankets. But  since the seats  were wider, they weren't easy to  get in and  back of, and  with just us a number of  times contorted just to get out. The meals were fine, though served on a tiny  plane loaded with food, the meal was pretty good. Not a lot  other choices, to London, beef or pasta, from London back to LA, it was beef or fish. It was hot and  so was a lot of food, a salad, small  cheese and  cheese crackers. Roll butter and dessert . I'm not sure I'd say  this was what  the advertisement claims.  It didn't feel  there was a  great meal. They also served snacks , it was  dark on the  flight with no explanation of where  to go to  find the snacks.  The entire plane  was dark. The second meal was  a breakfast, but not especially appealing. On the return  from LA, it was a very odd casserole, rather dry and bland.  Our flight was  fine and arrived on time, coming back we were  1 hour late waiting as the  airline informed us of sixty passengers  coming late from Germany. They lost one of our suitcases enroute, we arrived on Thursday afternoon, the bag was delivered late Friday night to  a hotel, no offer to help with expense of having to buy  what was needed  until bag was found. Not even an email or  phone we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight Friday,  but weren't notified by BA until  Monday afternoon. We  end up spending  such a lot buying shirts, underwear and shorts to get by. If we'd known they  had found the  bag we wouldn't 've spent the money. Poor communication  for their part.  Not an apology  or sorry for the inconvenience. I  think they figured  they should be grateful we got the bag at all. I doubt we'd fly BA again sadly I'd hoped for something special."
3.0,"We flew Business Class to Vienna , the 28/7/15, Terminal 3 is a dismal place  - the lounge reflected this. There  were very poor food choices and everything was tired  from the staff.  The outward journey  was okay, flight attendant was pleasant.  Do think the meal choices could  have improved -  the tickets are  not cheap. However the return flight , which was  not economy -  although not cheap, was not good  at all. The  service of the staff was really below par. The  meal choice was an iced bun and a chicken/bacon bun. Seeing the  food I asked  for the vegetarian  bun with a few slices of pepper - all of which were tasteless.  When  asked would I  like a drink  they replied - Bloody Mary. I  must have known better, as this  time the attendant who having to do a live  music demo chewed and smirked the whole way through,  finishing the drink without any WS. I asked if I could have  some and then watched him add  another good 1cm to the drink - turning the tomato juice a dark brown. BA need to remember we as the customers pay their wages."
3.0,"The staff were great, food was pretty good, their seating policy is a sham. For that reason I'd never fly with BA again. I have issues with  security and they changed my Aisle  seats to a window seat at the last moment and I had  to endure no room to move for most of our flight from  Brisbane to Sydney."
4.0,"Short trip to  Dubai in BA Economy Class from  gate 3. New er cabin on the flight out - looks nice , fairly comfortable  within a couple of hours. Other  than the cheap,  over processed cheese  and ham croissant  and a coffee  we are given  this is no different to a  high cost airline.  The service minimal - they served  food and collected the leftovers, basically  cleaned the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour  plus 10 minute  journey - not  providing an additional  toilet service. I'm sure if they were flogging the  plane it would  feel different. Return a couple of days later, older , but clean. Same indifferent service,  more processed carbs handed out in silence and 1  - This wasn't  a cheap ticket  ( 200GBP) -  we know BA  are competing with  low cost airlines  across Europe but when are they  coming to realise  you aren't a  high cost airline?  A bit of  kindness from the staff and a couple of extra  drinks would have  meant all difference to how I felt leaving those  in BA sadly  seemed to be  leaving behind the crowd."
2.0,"BA Airways Business  Class product has  only really changed  for the last  few years, and they are now  falling behind competition  in seat comfort (half of the  seats must still  seat facing backwards)  to entertainment. What  once made BA  this great airline  were the cabin  staff who treated  the passengers like guests. Unfortunately, they  were slowly retiring , replaced by  disgruntled employees who could care or less about high  class passengers. On this particular flight,  the cabin was  nearly full, but  the crew rushed  food service to an extent I  have never seen ; the pre-dinner drinks were served,  and less than 5 minutes later,  dinner was served  the first course.  We did not  actually start the  service when the plate was taken , and I  got presented with  the beef fillet  which was totally  delicious Ten minutes later, the trays were taken away, and the lights  off We did  never see the crew again for  the next 9 hours, and no water or juice  is ever served.  Today BA has the only non-stop flight between Cape  York and London, but next time I will fly  back via Dubai  even if that  means adding 4 hours to the  journey"
4.0,"Had a very unpleasant experience with BA this time. They changed our family seats without  asking First time flying with two babies, booked the ticket and reserved  two seats together sitting together with husband. Both babies  in lap seat.  Two days before  the flight I called the BA service to make sure our seats and ticket are all fine and got a positive answer. On the day of boarding , out out seats are moved . For 12 hours flight, our family seats are arranged far apart. After more than 40 minutes standing at the counter  waiting for the coordination, we could  move across the aisle when we  arrived on the plane. No food  with my 2  month old. If we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane, what do BA expect baby can eat? No help from staff with any service.  Both babies are crying and very restless  we didn't get any help from BA ! When I  fly with other airlines, flight attendant  brought small toys to help distract  & entertain baby. BA forgot to  take out stroller  before we landed."
7.0,"This was my return flight of  a trip in  The USA. From  London to the USA we had  a Airbus A380  which was modern  but quite enjoyable to fly. My return flight was  on a Boeing  737 The aircraft was quite old with seats which  were so comfortable  or at least  looked OK. The flight was good, cabin crew were friendly, sometimes  absent in the  plane and not very happy when  you asked them something.  The  food was OK, not gastronomic but acceptable in an economy class. We had delays of 35 minutes by landing, so the flight were quite  some time, though   the longest delay was due  to an engine problem. I recommend  British Airways even for short flights (if you book  ahead and fares not too high) than for longer ones. One reason  this is that connections in Heathrow are easy when  we have two BA flights, transfer done in 35mins."
2.0,"I have flown in business class  for BA on  many occasions and  find the service to be hit and miss. If you get an indifferent crew -  which in my  experience is not far off half the time - they want you  too eat your  food as fast as possible, go  and sleep and not bother them any more. Once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and  ask you to  wait for everything. I have never  had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example Emirates, EVA or Lan eworld quite the  same Anyway, BA were offering a  reduced price to  those (cash only)  passengers first on  the Vancouver-Heathrow flight. I thought I'd try it. It was a waste of money. The  biggest sign of trouble was the fact that I  was not welcomed or addressed by  anyone - an absolute must I  had Then the  crew and they tend to be the worst on  average I am  sad to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though  I were in  class - he  then doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in  the personal manner. The wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when I  requested a specific  drink (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know  an answer. I eat slowly and  am still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. I thought 'Oh no, surely  get in first'. Well, I was wrong. I was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and  request to see the menu for dessert. After that, unbelievably, I was  rejected again and,  to protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. I asked to speak to  a cabin services  manager (female, delighful ), who was  FULL of apologies, of course, and off I went back to my seat. When I was finally given  one the flight  agent who brought  blankets (another female) confided that BA don't have the  crew numbers to  make the same  prices to first  and business passengers  as some other airlines do, I couldn't believe my ears. As for  our cabin, being in the nose of the 747,I felt cramped. The  overhead lighting doesn't  compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats  and carpet. The in-light entertainment was to my surprise  exactly the same as on the rest of the plane. I know this reads like <mask> demolition job on BA but I have made no exaggerations. I <mask> think Willie Walsh should don a false beard <mask> shades and <mask> a decent number of flights in business and <mask> on his own planes. He'd find out for himself. I want <mask> to be <mask> best and it simply isn't. Lastly, my experience of the hit <mask> miss service <mask> BA business <mask> is shared by every other <mask> I have ever mentioned it to. If you're flying BA stay <mask> business class, you're not missing <mask>"
1.0,"This review is written due to what I feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The  lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant,  friendly and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and  refuse to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to,  given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board  would not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited  in the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I  will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business. My advice do not waste your money with BA, it's service cutting to the point of insult."
10.0,"Use online check-in  and boarding passes with the BA  Mobile APP. It  was so easy  too use and  it helps you  quickly get rid  off those annoying loose bits of  paper from your  holiday bags. Manchester Airport Terminal 3 is bursting at  the seams during  the summer holiday . There's a  distinct lack of  space in this  airport but despite  this the security check didn't take  very long at  all The BA  flight staff at  Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded  us in groups from the back  to the aircraft  at the front.  It helps stop  you queuing in  long aisles onboard  and get to your seat. We  were greeted at  our aircraft door  with a couple of cheerful and  helpful crew. The  BA cabin now  looks very modern,  spacious and clean.  A comfort of  the new seats  covers the space  of this aircraft  that I feel would be more  then sufficient for a flight of  2 hours or so (I'm 5ft !). With a  full loaded cabin , a flight time to Heathrow  of just over 30 minutes the  attendants were quick  on action. We  were offered a  free breakfast bacon  and orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for  taking a short  journey and definitely  what set BA apart from the competition. The flight  rolled into Terminal  3 a few minutes ahead of  schedule and outside  of UK Arrivals area less than  10 minutes later."
3.0," I am a  very frequent long  distance traveller and although I will  still choose the  regional carriers (e.g.  Singapore Airlines, JAL, ) over British  Airways being based  in London means that I do  occasionally fly with  them I find BA's long haul  business class offering  very innovative when  BA was launched  during the 90s  but now been  seriously outclassed by  some of its  rivals The seats  cannot quite lie  flat (and it's  quite unusual to  see a broken seat) and half the passengers have  either go backwards  and climb over  fellow passengers to  get out -  we can't think  about any other  UK airline that has this any more in business ! I am  told by a  BA contact that  I considered changing  this configuration for  their A380s, but  refused in the end. Worst of  ALL I find  the onboard service  is inconsistent -  quite often it's  very little begrudging,  some it is  frustrating and sometimes it is downright . I was  especially annoyed at  BA customer service  that on a  journey from LHR  in Tokyo Haneda, when settling down  on my seat,  suddenly looked down  to find a  used napkin, used  pencil and toothpick and significant quantities  of broken glass  around my feet  (* job I 'd taken my  shoes off at this stage). My  passenger flagged down  a member of cabin crew, who  promised she would  try and clear , but didn't.  She flagged down  a Cabin Services Director who did  offer a dustpan  or brush and  promised he would  do it. Upon  our return, I  spoke to BA.  Within three weeks, they deigned to  respond but it  was on the lines of 'our cabins are always  kept to the  minimum standards, we  are sorry you  cannot find this  for your liking'  - effectively implying  me I was  making a fuss  about nothing. "
1.0,"Booked for our  return to Uganda,  27 Feb 2015  - spent £1450 for 2 return tickets, had to pay an additional £100 to reserve seats on the flights. About 2  months ago I  received a text message (not a !) saying that  our flight had been cancelled - left us in  absolute dark until  i had to phone their 0844  numbers to get transferred to a Delhi call centre,  when I was told I could get a full refund they tried  to only refund  was for the  ticket and not the seats on this now, non  return flight. I  had to phone back a further 2 times to  get through to  someone that could understand that I did want my  refund as well. In a nutshell, I will not book with British Airways again,"
10.0,"Flew Club Europe from Istanbul to Heathrow, excellent flight  with quick and easy boarding. The service was as  close to a  European standard with  a good selection of choices for  the evening meal. Entertainment was OK for the flight. Nice touch being  told to leave  a plan first,  this can make  some of the difference for the  person at T5."
9.0,"Flew Club Europe  to Istanul on  Saturday boarding was speedy and boarding  very quickly for  me on time . The flight  is excellent and  the crew in  club Europe were  as always providing  excellent service and  none at all , Although the  aircraft is showing  its age, I  still prefer this  model to the  737 which also  is used on  our route, on  a 767 at  present the Club  Europa seats are  comfortable and offer  lots of leg  space unlike the  seats Club Europe  seat is used  on the A320's  it is in  style going back  into the days  of charter airlines!  Oh come on  BA Airways lets  go back to  your old configurations , we have  advantage of leg room in Club  European and reduce  our rows of  seats we do  not want Low  cost Airline look  of otherwise we  would fly them,  we choose BA , we are  looking to you , bring back  to old standards  yet again."
1.0,"Management seems to  be losing its  mind to run an airline. I ve had 4  planes canclled in  the last 3  weeks 3 of  these while I  worked at the  gate Every flight  they does operate  gets delayed. Staff attitude is appallimg,  people just don't  appear to care.  I have no  idea My step daughter was deinied  yesterday due to BA overbooking. BA then messed up  their rebooked flight  and then lost  his luggage. No  pay and no  reason Should their  motto be "" Pay to Fly,  Pay to Serve""?"
1.0,"Always a loyal  airline customer, I  often travel economy  and shorthaul but  as am 6'4""  have long legs  so am very  light unless I  can get Exit ! So on  my flight I  take advantage of  buying what I  believed was a  full priced Club  EU ticket expecting  not past 34 inch seat pitch.  However to find  upon boarding that  airlines have reduced  the seat pitch  from 30 inch , exactly the  same as in : The presence  was an empty  window seat and  very little table  on your tablet  there is no  joke Fortunately this  was a short flight but even  then I was extremely uncomfortable. Cabin  crew and other  passengers said there  had been loads  more complaints but  thankfully BA don't  fly I sometimes  travel to Cyprus  but the thought  about a 4  hours flight in  these cramped seats  pissed me off ! The meal was passable but  because the flight  got off a  couple of minutes  before midday it  got classed as  "" breakfast"" and  red wine was served. It is clear that BA are putting profit  before customer service  but I am  surprised that anyone  wants Club Europe.  Later in the year I was  planning to travel  across South America  via Madrid in  First Class but  am now cancelled  or switched to another airline. In  2019 I will  travel BA shorthaul  if possible."
7.0,"Got a hand book only fare at short notice so it was pricey. Allocated a decent seat but amazed at charge of €26 to change it so didn't bother. Flight seemed to be full of families split up probably for the same  reason A ripoff.  Flight was late, usual excuse of late arrival from  the previous flight. Flight deck crew affable. Food and drink good and free, a bonus. Cabin attendants, an older purser up  quite a bit , The two in economy were really going through the motions, no eye contact and  bad service. 1 drink served in a 2.5 hour  flight For the  last hour the two at the back were eating Club Europe meals which I saw them bring from the front. This was BA2591 on 22 July. Not great."
8.0,"Flying to London  Airport in Business Class, seats were  extremely comfortable. Reminded  me of sleeping in berth on  arrival Food was good and the  staff were very nice and attentive.  We had a  brief layover at Gatwick before flying  on to Inverness. Couldn't use the BA lounge after  that flight, but  usually that is  not the case  in Heathrow. Don't  see why. We  took rewards to  Sky Club World , enjoyed it.  I have flown  the long haul  three times and  we have earned  the return business."
4.0,"I had the misfortune to travel up to Newcastle on a hand-baggage only fare which, for some reason, doesn't entitle you to choose a  class I was allocated seat 11A  which had the tightest leg-room I have experienced, luckily it was only a short 50 min flight. These fares aren't cheap and BA seem to be focussing  more on extracting  so much money  is possible rather than providing a good service which  has a real  premium"
3.0,"Day trip to Vienna, used BA Economy as their  Business Class fares are a complete rip off on BA these days. Heathrow T3 departure experience is quite shoddy compared to T2 or main BA flights out of T5. Service onboard the flight  was perfunctory at best, and staff  appear to perform to a script  which in some  cases portray the feeling that because they wear a BA uniform they think they are so excellent -  The sad fact is their standards are below several major European airlines.  Chris Purser, CSD  (- whichever grand title they give to cabin staff) on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling  in the galley like a 6 year old child, and then proceeded to make the  necessary announcements in the campest and  most disrespectful tone of voice - again, this seemed  to be done  for the amusement of his fellow t-d's. As a oneworld Emerald (not with BA!), I stick with oneworld members, but Austrian  offers a much better service and quality standard than BA."
1.0,"let me just  starting off by  saying that I'm  a educator, and I have the  temperament of a saint. This being , after my first flight with  BA when my  parents stayed in  India and didn't  made it to  The UK until four days after  she arrived, I 'm fairly calm.  Plans are made.  My flight had  been canceled (which  seems like commonplace at BA), and  I re-booked after  about three hours on the phone.  As I ventured  out take my  flight home, I  am notified via text message that  my flight had  been canceled yet ! After speaking  to a calm man about my horrible experience thus  far he informed  me of a  customer care number  so I could  reach and complain  about my flight.  Now remember I'm  your teacher, and I also payed  BA for this ! That's an  8 months pay  period so we  all know. I'm  preparing to leave  London and still  has not received  anything via email.  Also cannot reach  me via telephone.  Has not been  provided proper accommodations  that resolve my dissatisfaction with BA.  Safe to say I will never  use BA again."
3.0,"My baggage check in took forever,  I was 45-50min  just standing in the queue. The  baggage looked good  & well maintained , Inflight entertainment  was good and  listening to latest  TV documentaries, talk  of 5* for  me The seating  area was just about good enough.  be careful of the head set  you can get  on the way  and snap. The air conditioner was  not up to the mark so  air was warm in the cabin.  My inflight food  got extremely hot,  in short it  got burnt. The  excuse from the flight crew when  I asked for  my second helping of 150ml coke  tea is that  we needed to  keep stock for the return flight.  This was the  first time in  years of international travel of hearing this excuse."
6.0,"Flight was decent.  Safe to say the seat was rather cramp. I'm  5 or 5 foot 9, sat  at seat 32F. Inflight entertainment was alright, but do take note to  never unplug the  headphones whenever you  come out of  your seat. It damages easily if  one gets caught  in something. I had to change  the headsets because  of that, because  being in a aisle seat, you have to get off when someone  wants to use  a lavatory, thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get  up from your seat. Service was  good I requested for eye shades, and it came  about 1hr later, crew must have forgotten about my request. I didn't pursue it as I thought I  could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie. In  terms of food, it was appalling  and greasy. Overall, I will not say never again, but given a choice, I'd look  again for Singapore Air first, then  the big 3 Gulf carriers. For  the right price I'd do BA again, otherwise, there are better ways to suffer than that cramped seat"
7.0,"LHR to KUL. Bag drop off took much longer  that expected especially as we had  not checked and printed our boarding . Full plane  departure about 45 mins late. Food and drink better than expected, as was cabin crew  service and seat ! Friendly and efficient service. I suspect the plane might have seen better days given  as the entertainment system was ancient - no games, small screen compared  to the likes of Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. Some cost cutting evident : no menus, hot towels, metal  chairs - which is fine by  them  Would be happy to  travel with them again."
7.0,"Both flights on time, aircraft appeared to be well maintained. BA should  feel commended for  having 9-abreat seating in the 777, legroom is adequate and adjustable headrest  is a nice touch. AVOD was decent, with clear  audio though movie  screening was not extensive. Catering was  poor on the outbound flight from Atlanta, with breakfast  nearly being inedible,  though much better on the inbound flight from London. Cabin crew were  attentive but utterly aloof, interacting with the passengers without the slightest hint of warmth. Not allowing seat selection until 24 hours prior to the flight (without paying ), is a  crime in my  opinion"
7.0,"Outbound flight to  Amsterdam was on time, but return flight delayed by  over 2 hours. Due to an equipment change the  flight was on a B767, and I was seated in the premium economy cabin, which was definitely more comfortable, and had the added benefit of AVOD, which is unavailable in  the usual A320. I was pleasantly surprised to be served a warm meal on both  flights which is more than I was expecting on an intra-European flight.  Agents were professional, but not particularly helpful or engaging."
8.0,"Return to London Gatwick in Business  and seats were quite comfortable. Reminded me of sleeping  a berth on . Food was very good and the service staff  were all very nice and attentive.  Also had a  long layover at Gatwick before flying  on to Inverness.  We use the  departures lounge after  a flight, but  find that is  only the case  from Heathrow. Don't  know why. We used rewards to  fly Club World  and really enjoyed.  They have flown  the long haul  numerous times and they have earned our return business."
3.0,"I might have been in economy for service, food and seating, 8 abreast. No room to move. If you are over 80kg or 6',  be squashed completely. WC clean with paper towels. Adequate IFE. The difference between older crew on prior sectors and young cabin crew on this flight was stark. They were polite and totally wooden. On past sectors the older crew took the time to know you and, as a frequent flyer, even say thanks for  flying BA. Hung  I returned crushed. The dinner was the same as Jet Airways domestic , Breakfast at 03.30 a bit of fruit, tepid  breakfast pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil. Club World is like a stretched Economy with a Business Class fare."
6.0,"The lounge was more business class then first. Boarding smooth, aircraft clean. Didn't like the seat much, B777 the seat is closer to the windows then the A800 which is  far preferable for me. Crew professional, no WIFI, just repeat that no WIFI, food selection limited as they had a 'catering issue'. If I booked and paid for First Class  you shouldn't have to hear they had a catering issue. I had  my sampler selection  from the wine coupling. The portion were small so had to ask for more food from a la carte, overall the food was not fantastic. Saving grace has to be BA cabin crew very polite and  professional"
8.0,"After read many reviews on here I was somewhat  skeptical about flying Club World with BA, however, I  were pleasantly surprised by the comfort, service and overall experience that we enjoyed on this 13 hour flight to Kuala Lumpur. We had front row seats 10A and 10B, 10A window seat is  forward facing and 10B is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats  are very comfortable  so we got a solid 8  hrs sleep. We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the  case and would recommend this seat,  which also has no one stepping over you to get out of  a seat, seat  11 gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. Very attentive and cheery cabin , they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. The food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take  off and during flight, wine selections ok. I would  be happy to travel BA Club World again on this 777-200 aircraft  in seats 10AB or 10JK, but I do prefer the Upper Deck on the 747, sad will be  a day they retire the good old Jumbo, I'm not a lover  with the new A380."
2.0,"LHR-BKK-LHR. Started badly with all the  unnecessary baggage warnings at Terminal 5. BA's low 23kg baggage allowance had me nervy. Seating  with less legroom than competitors and seat not very comfy. Outward food  the best economy meal I've had in a long time. Return trip horrible. At check-in I was under 30kg but over the 23kg derisory BA limit. Was asked for £65 more but declined. When I quoted Thai Airways 30kg limit I was invited to buy a ticket with them. So I had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap  bags to get my boarding pass. On the plane  I had to sit next to a very fat man (not BAs fault) and the food was disgusting. Some rubber chicken with four strips  and gravy-sodden potato wedges. No vegetables. Second meal only  served by tasteless  piece of sponge. No salad, yoghurt or other goodies. Between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. IFE had  the smallest screen I have ever  used and a  limited choice of films. Return flight journey progress constantly broke down. Generally, a poor experience considering BA's prices. Will not be using BA again."
5.0,"Business economy on newly refitted Airbus . The seats  offer so little legroom, it has the feeling of a budget airline  different from budget  - but OK for a short  trip The problem is this seat configuration is used  in Europe and it's possible to  stay in such  poor conditions for  a longer flight. Upgrading to business  is a solution  - there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have  used both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few  years as well.  Norwegian had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but  avoid Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue  to be very mixed : some  very polite and helpful. Others are  sometimes rude (as  I was on this flight) Overall,  service can be great, but sometimes  just so much."
10.0,"I flew BA 's LHR to  Room 64A, Upper  Lounge in Club , Excellent experience , great service , a good  movie selection too.  BA crew were  polite and very attentive but the  lack of crew  on passengers hels as there are  just 20 seats  in the upper  decks with two  cabin crew. The  cabin was comfortable  with plenty of  seating and storage under the windows was a great  feature too. The  onboard entertainment was  great but the  service was very  small compared to  how it used  once be, BA  could do more  to add a  bit wider variety to its film selection, otherwise a  fantastic flight."
10.0,"Excellent First Class  flights from Chicago  to London, easy  access and excellent  facilities provided at all times by  our cabin crew  in First Class. The food was  good and a  large selection available . Breakfast was  provided with a  large selection with  choice of organge a and tea  which came in  a pot which  had a lovely . If you are flying British Airways and connecting  to an American  Express domestic flight  take note that  passengers can now  travel from T3  to T5 at  the airside by shuttle bus which  leaves every 30 mins thus avoiding  the security lines in T5, this  is only to  American Passengers tranferring from an American  domestic or American  domestic flight to  a British Airways ."
4.0,"I was amazed that this airline charges extra to  get a seat in advance. I have never seen that on any  other the non-discount carriers, especially in business class. When I pay for  my business seat I expect that  a section will be free and  there won't be  paying for another ! The b-class , not uncomfortable,  just configured weirdly,  very little storage space near the  aisle The FAs  have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window,  which is annoying  but probably makes extra work for . The food  is flat out  and looked like  standard microwave fare.  Food service was OK, nothing special.  While I wasn't going to watch any in-flight entertainment,  we did check  this out. Pretty meager selection. If given a choice, I don't think  I will fly  anymore after this  flight is over."
1.0,"One leg CAI-LHR  arrived on time,  the crew was  great but the  plane was very cramped and legroom  is non-existent. The second leg LHR-JFK  is much different : helpful crew  and horrible seating space. My knees  felt pressed against  my seat in front of me constantly and had to relieve them  two at a  stretch It used  once be a  budget carrier but  today it's not  even better than  the budget airline.  I do my  utmost to avoid."
8.0,"Travelled in party of four with prebooked seating 4 abreast outbound, 2 abreast inbound. Cabin clean, well presented and tidy with good welcome. Not a full flight but approx 80% loading. The level of service from cabin staff was excellent. Service got  better quickly with full choice of menu and drinks available. Good, clear  and short information from flight deck. Toilets were clean and tidy throughout flight. Lights dimmed  two and a half hours into flight to allow rest with water rounds taking place by cabin crew. Good English breakfast served 1.5 hours out of JNB. Return flight good with attentive cabin staff and quiet cabin enabling some sleep. Food did not seem to be of such  as good standard  for this leg. BA on these flights provided excellent service and we were impressed. TV screens a little too small."
3.0,"It is getting more like a budget airline every time I fly.  I now have  to pay £15 to choose a seat when I  fly in and then wait an  additional time to board. Fast track  was called forward  boarding and about  20 of the passengers went that way. When I  first got to the front I  ask if all  on fast track were fast track  and was told ""no but we  are not allowed to make them go to the general boarding queue""  so what is the point. Easyjet  and Norwegian are  far better than BA for short haul and any Middle East airline for long haul. Try harder BA please!"
9.0,"Service on time, nice crew on  my plane, very comfortable seat and great food. Snacks  and beverages served during my 6 hour flight. The  projection system screen  is big, but with not a lot of TV shows and movies. Everything was perfect, even the arrival was great."
8.0,"The booking of our flights was straightforward. However, when we have paid to sit next to each other,  and paid for  this opportunity to  book seats in advance, you would expect the seating plan for the aircraft to clearly show where all the toilets and galleys are so  we as the paying customer we  would have a  choice as to whether to is near them particularly on a long haul flight, on  this occasion British Airways failed miserably. The plane was new and the  beds were comfortable and spacious enough, not the upper  deck in ecconomy.  Sadly being seated next to the toilets was not the best location, particularly as we had pre booked the seats online. The service was  excellent and the staff helpful and happy to be there. The gluten free meals that we ordered were provided although the  cost could have been more substantial especially after an 11 hour flight. All in all a stress free journey which was comfortable."
4.0,"Check in at First counter by  a scruffy guy  who wouldn't check my bag through on a connection.  Excellent ground crew  - ordinary on First check in  ( special) and in the lounge.  Asked to answer  why there was an arrivals lounge at Changi and  clearly not interested  with passengers (sorry ) compared with  some Qantas products. Managed to get upstairs at the  final minute on  First (10/7). Excellent  ground crew. Couldn't  be been more  accommodating than on  every other sector  of this trip.  Friendly and interested. They couldn't understand  the lack of  my bag at Singapore. Good food,  nice cabin, uncomfortable  & dated seat  and didn't sleep ! This cabin  I probably don't  pass on to  another Shame because they were excellent."
3.0,"We encouraged passengers  to check-in online  to save it  both time and money, what does  this do? It  makes the number of staff for  airlines drop to  the barest minimum.  Economy class bag  checks at 08:30 at Heathrow had  three empty desks  in a queue  resulting in a  totally unacceptable wait of more than 15 minutes. Then having raced through  security there was the almost inevitable flight delay, only  this time the  added delay to  an incoming aircraft  was a result,  passengers were told,  from someone forgetting  the tow the  bags on to  a stand from another part of  Manchester airport! With  planes taking off to the west, there was yet  again 20 minutes  wait during taxiing. Only crisps or  a couple of  breakfast biscuits were  carried along with . Sadly the  gulf between the national airline and  the carriers just gets closer all the time."
8.0,"BA2678, LGW-DBV, 16/06/15,  and BA2679, DBV-LGW,  London Baggage drop  was fast at the BA check  in Then had to wait 10 minutes for the the express sercurity  to open didnt  boarding at 5.30  pm as stated. The lounge at  home excellent, good selection of food  and drinks. Priority boarding very good. The flight out  looked good, nothing was too much  work for the cabin crew. On the return again fast check in, then queued for 20 minutes to  go through customs (no fast check in) once through  and to the lounge - ok but not as good as Gatwick. Priority boarding poor  in Dubrovnik, all put on a bus to be taken to the  airport Cabin crew not as freindly  as the return  flight Both flights about on time. The only complaint is the club europe seating, you pay a lot  less for theese , but the  seat is the same as economy leg room. Come on BA put it back to 34 inches as you are just giving more buisness to Easyjet and Ryanair."
9.0,"Overall the journey  went good. The  flight was okay,  snacks were served  snacks which weren't  very appetizing. The cabin had recently been refurbished, it was very clean  and new with mood lighting. Screens coming down from the ceiling provided  us with a moving map. Overall  very good flight."
1.0,"If I could give it a  go I would. From the moment we checked flight departure time and were incorrectly informed resulting in waiting to board for over 3 hours, to the incorrect arrival time as  shown on the  big screen. A  4 hour flight with only 1 main meal plus a snack served - without any drinks. Their idea  of an Asian vegetarian meal is grilled vegetables and  alcoholic drinks only served when the  customers were either not sleeping or chatting away. Very uncomfortable hard seat, aisles so small that most passengers  had their legs  stretched out in  those aisles and  finally finishing with nearly an hour  wait thru customs  & then having to wait 20 minutes for my luggage. Can you please get off your backsides BA,  please fly economy with Singapore Airlines as they still realize it's human beings they are transporting."
9.0,"The staff were excellent from the  beginning to the finish. Service onboard  were friendly, professional,  extremely helpful. My wife left her handbag on board the plane when  she arrived at Heathrow, and the BA flight attendant  actually travelled from Terminal 3 to  Terminal 5 to  help deliver it back to her.  if you know  this huge distance between terminal 3  and 5 at Heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. That exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these  times so BA  earned a 100% customer care rating from my wife and I. Snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. Aircraft was  fine however the only negative was  the Business Class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the  one thing that BA should really  improve as it sort of killed  something otherwise perfect  seat They were standard Economy Class  seats cramped in tight so your  feet were pressing into the seat in front. To convert these to Business Class seats all they did was put a fancy clip-in style armrest to make  the row configuration 2 seats instead of 3."
7.0,"And it was ! The flight  attendants were friendly  and helpful. The  seats were fairly  small with plenty  for storage space  on the sides.  The food and entertainment were fine.  Our husband's screen  did not work at first, but  a flight attendant  replaced it in  a few minutes.  Our cabin was . One of  our seats did  contain a broken  chunk of plastic  like the cup holder was. It  may have pinched  / cut someone.  We were happy with the flights."
3.0,"Same tired plane  ride to London.  Pilot and cabin staff were friendly, pleasant and helpful. A first on this series of flights. Flew on the same plane on the way from LHR to  London (see other recent reviews). Moved to row 1 , more space. Still sub-standard and why, why put economy seats in business class? Lounge was crammed and noisy pre-flight. I  joined Star Alliance as a Gold Member so at least got to see the Miles and Smiles lounge. BA, look around  or rest on  your century's efforts. I've flown BA First but just  not any more. Responding to Skytrax  concerns may just help increase profits. I must say,  apart from the  rude crew on  BA 677, the polite but totally disinterested service (when it exists) and  the cramped cabins will be my memory of this business trip."
5.0,"All I can say is mediocre.  I flown this  plane with other  companies in business , I believe  I have been  disappointed The British  Airways product is  mediocre and just  like TV screen , and poor , food okay  and nothing more,  just poor. The  main highlight was  quality of service  by the crew.  We had nothing  too actually complain about, but nothing  would make me  want to use  this product again."
3.0,"I have been flying between Dublin  to London once every 2 weeks on average since the beginning of the year, and I have regularly used British Airways  in the beginning. However, I have found their new policy of asking  around £15 for seat selection (even at check-in) really annoying, unnecessary and  insulting to loyal customers. Fair enough if they want to charge for pre-booking of seats, but at least they should allow  this at check-in time in line with their direct competitors on the same route (Aer Lingus). I have also found the service (food, drinks ), extremely poor for the fare charged, even for the short sector. If they continue their money-grabbing policy  they will definitely and happily give more of my business to Aer Lingus and Cityjet which operate the same route and seem to not treat their customers as infinite cash cows."
2.0,"B serviceless, low class. I had low expectations and they weren't met. Club World has  moved from leading  to lagging. Cramped  seats (8 seats  max when others have 6), and a tired old plane. I usually fly in an  aisle seat but know better on  flights so was in a window seat. The passenger next to me  got repeatedly woken  as food was handed over or  dropped on him. After the service the polite cabin crew disappeared. Only  one bottle of water all flight.  My food was tasteless, overcooked and the presentation with  the food condiments reminded me of  fast food chain. At the price this is the worst product in the skies. Seat was broken and IFE clunky. Being  compared to CX, QF, SIA, Finnair,  Air Tahiti Nui, AA, Lan Chile  many more, I hesitate to call it business class  as it isn't."
1.0,"From Club world , Club Europe  is the same , Economy on  a decent airline. Food was okay,  served with alcohol  if you wanted . Must be  our oldest aircraft  in the fleet.  Only IFE other  then a 24""  bag for the  cabin Was told  from the ground  floor that my  checked international cabin bag needed to  have checked in, not happy. It's  normal on international and domestic roll ers other than  being a turboprop. My colleague had  the same. Officious , uncalled for.  All the same  two bags were  brought aboard 4 days later on  a return flight.  All were economy  only and cramped  with little recline , less pitch than economy on  most airlines. Why  go for Club  and business class  when you don't get it?"
2.0,"I managed to switch to upstairs on the 744,  quite happy as  this is a quiet space. Seat 64A footstool was  full so the  floor was uncomfortable. We left Singapore  around midnight and got into LHR  at 0441hrs, so sleep was intermittent as I tried to adjust the  position to compensate.  Life out of  Singapore was okay but still lacking. One pleasant attendant, one grumpy. No  Fast Track on landing because we got in early,  no queue with coach tours. I'm  staying on British Airways this trip  and won't be booking by choice again."
3.0,"All meals ran out, just sausage and potato left,  NO children's meals available! Return flight delayed by 7 hours as plane was not in a safe condition. Scheduled flight at 8pm departed at 3.30am! They had to fly one in to Orlando all the way from Cardiff -  very bad joke. No children's meals  available "
10.0,"Overall good all  first class flight, only issue experienced  being the slow  food delivery upon  arrival in JFK.  Service exceptional and  entertainment provided was good. The seats  fitted full flat.  Space provided for  good entertainment, with  various films, tv , etc. A  comfortable flight albeit  a little expensive."
1.0,"If British Airways review their seating  options I will  use the airline again. The seats are so cramped and when the passenger in front decided to recline his seat that was it, no matter how much I asked him to recline back, he would not do it. Only when the food  came did he  leave his seat  again and to  add insult to  injury the food tasted vile, and  ending up eating  the bread roll ! I will use BA now as a last option."
1.0,"Flew back 30  minute LGW-MCO flight delayed at Gatwick for 8 hours. Got told at 13.55 when flight was supposed to leave that there was a technical fault and they  were bringing in a new aircraft  from Cardiff, told  to report back  around 15.15 to be told that still not here  and to report back later and given £10 voucher. Told we would take off at 17.15 Come 17.15 got told they needed to try and get a crew. Did not depart until after . It was our tenth wedding anniversary not one member of staff said anything (I spoke with back  home office the day before and  got told they  would arrange a glass of champagne ). Boarded aircraft  it was a very old 777, no champagne, no duty free and no kids packs. My IFE had to be rebooted."
10.0,"I was pleased  I see that  Qatar Airways now  have 'proper' gates  at Terminal 3 , compared to  the previous bus  stop scrum. The  service was organised,  flight crew friendly  and the onboard  food good. We  were served a tasty ham and  cheese croissant with  before the flight departed and arrived  before time and  it arrived quickly. The seat wasn't  very comfortable but  All in all,  was good!"
5.0,"This was my first time with British Airways. I was disappointed in the amount of seat/leg room compared to some other airlines I've traveled with. I was also surprised that on longer European  flights London to Istanbul for example which I traveled) there was no TV when the flight is as long or longer than flights in Asia from country-to-country  which have TV/entertainment system. The universal  audio system was broken too and  its sound wasn't working. The service button to call an attendant was broken too. A stewardess on this particular flight from JFK to LHR (BA1511 on June 19, 2015) was  really rude to my daughter. My daughter is unable to eat dairy and both food options on the plane included dairy. My daughter asked  her if there was any non-dairy options and the stewardess, takes the food from my daughter’s tray and says “I guess you’re just going to have to eat that salad.” It wasn’t what  she said that bothered me, it was the way she said it.  We didn’t offer pretzels or non-dairy snacks or anything. This was my  first experience with British Airways, and I was disappointed. It wasn’t until my flight back home that I felt a bit  relieved On my  flights back with British Airways, not this flight in specific (from LHR to LAS), I encountered a steward  that was very pleasant, polite and very professional. "
1.0,"As a frequent  flyer on various airlines, British Airways  was by far  the worst I 've experienced. Substandard  customer service even before the flight. My original plan  is to fly from Toronto to Rome via London  on July 2nd.  My tickets were  purchased and confirmed in March. Two weeks before departure,  no email was  emailed to me  regarding my flight  connecting London to Rome. I called  and waited on the service hotline  until I was able to get  in on one  flight and my parents on another. The rep refused  even try to put me together with my parents.  Less than 48  hours before departure  a rescheduled flight was rerouted to  London The agent  informed me all  my travel expenses would be my . On the  morning of departure I got my flight from Gatwick to Rome after  flying from Heathrow.  It was told  later the flight  had rerouted to  Toronto and just before departure this  switched back to a direct flight to Rome - very confusing communication.  I arrived in Rome to discover my parents flight  was delayed for  2 hours. With more BA flights  flying into the  city the service  center was closed  and my flight  had arrived. There  was no BA  representatives anywhere to  provide assistance."
1.0,"A family and I flew from Rotterdam to London  on 26th of  June and it's our first time traveling with BA.  We chose it  since we thought this airlines would  be better than  the airlines with  no delays. We  proved very wrong. We arrived at  London airport on  Tuesday and sat down to wait.  Airlines announced flight delays due to ""technical"" error for 1.5 hours before  then announcing that the flight was  cancelled We were  given no explanation  but for one phrase ""technical fault"". We were then  quickly sent back  into queue in line to be rescheduled. We waited  for 45 mins  which was then  transferred to a  different flight (original  time 1.05pm). We  are denied all chances to board an earlier one  for 4pm. We  could not complain  we gave BA  more trouble. We  violated procedures and  demanded for compensation . Their reply  is simply a  shrug and they  assume all responsibilities."
2.0,"Returning from Chicago to Berlin, the overall flight experience was no better than the outward sectors a week earlier. I opted to skip dinner and instead have breakfast since the flight landed around  noon Breakfast was a hard slab of cake with one drink - a total disgrace! Once again the cabin was too  cold and I saw no passengers using their blankets. The Berlin flight  also was delayed, initially due to  the usual ""late incoming aircraft"" excuse, and then to a broken APU.  Apparently no air was being pumped in to the cabin and the engines could not be started! For some reason it then took half an hour to locate one that did actually work. Meanwhile on one of the hottest days of the year we waited on board in  almost sauna-like conditions.  The captain kept us informed and then made up a bit if time, although we still landed 35 minutes late."
6.0,"My experience chimes  up the general  opinion on the  Disney World service : Cabin, seats and fittings are  past their age , look rather  dated by this point. Not too  much red wine  was on my  arm rest when  first boarded. Tiny  cabin and IFE  were dated, not  much entertainment selection.  Overall food quality  was good but service from cabin  staff was rather  slow with little  details to make  for a special  guest experience. Nuts  and chocolates served in packets, not  packed Not attentive  to providing drinks  - or water.  I wasnt offered all of the  food listed on  a menu -  Where did my  mac and cheese  sandwich go? Had  them ask for  my refills after  the meal. Brewed coffee only -  not fresh lattes/cappuccinos. Was not offered disgestifs after the meal. Cabin crew disappeared after the  meal Self service  items in the galley were economy  only (apart from some nice rose !) Just not a luxury or experience! Felt like I was in economy but with more space and  privacy"
1.0,"On this occasion  my partner and I experienced a 3.5 hour delay with BA. There was no communication  from the airport, nothing until we  stepped onto the  flight where the  crew told us  they were due  for a bag that had not been checked in  time at Heathrow.  Because of the  time when the  luggage finally arrived it had no  fuel on board and was not permitted to fill  up at our  gate This meant  no toilets because  had no flush , no warm drinks on board.  we were sat  at the runway  half an hour because the engines would not start. We had no aircon for 40 mins. When we  finally got back to Heathrow the captain told us that he was  sorry for the  plane"
8.0,"Boarding well organised and efficient. Seated  as World Traveller on the upper deck. 2x4x2 on this deck is preferable to the 3x4x3 on the lower deck. Flight attendants welcome customers on board and  staff was friendly  & professional. Seat  is comfortable. Legroom  adequate for economy. IFE excellent; a huge range of  meal options. The  worst was lunch. The chicken casserole was basically a  few pieces of chicken swimming in oil with a few vegetables. Very  good Afternoon tea,  on the other hand, was nice. ."
8.0,"According to FCO , BCN to  put PTV on  alert for e long haul planes,  I did the  same and it  automatically activated when  they boarded the  flight The food was ok except  during the return flight from London  to Montreal where  no chicken was  cooked No flight  delays on outbound journey but 3 hour delay on  the return flight  when the aircraft  had to be  grounded due to  some mechanical problem. ​"
3.0,"The night flight was delayed by  almost an hour;  not the fault  to the airline , a contributory factor to our disappointment with BA  on this flight , June 2015).  I paid extra  on our Premium Economy tickets, then  once again to reserve seats, and past experience with  them and with equivalent seats/service on Virgin Atlantic had led us to  expect value for  cash and some small rewards for the extra costs.  In this flight,  though where the  most real benefit  proved to be a small amount of extra legroom.  we were last  off board after First, Business and  Economy Where customers  in Premium Economy used to be  presented with the  option of a  bottle of fizz ed orange juice,  whatever it is  water or juice. Once we had  set off, drinks  are served; fine, but when the  waiter came to collect the empty glass/bottle, he knocked  his glass onto the floor, where  it broke - the staff were  very rushed and  made to be  working on numbers  that I was made to feel that the breakage  were my fault!  Dinner did not arrive until after  dark by which  point I had rather lost interest, as had my  passengers So far,  our extra costs  have bought us extra leg room  for one glass  or wine (I  had not offered a second, possibly  because of my  fear of causing  a steward to  drink a glass).  Quite by contrast  that other night , the lights were never fully  illuminated there were  no offers of water/orange juice to  avoid dehydration. The promised (on the  business card) morning  ' snack' and  orange juice was  the hastily delivered piece of dried-up  fruit and a  morning coffee - no mention of  orange juice. I  could really see what my extra  tickets were getting  us that those  on Economy had for less - the extra leg room was rather negated by the passenger in front's  less reclined seat. I will not,  not at all , be travelling with BA again.  It left a  rather sour taste  at the end of our holiday."
2.0,"Check in at  Emirates was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that  desk to sort  the problems. 100 minutes prior to departure, 2 check in desks were open - 1  business 1 economy. As a BA  credit card holder,  I joined the business queue. First  one lady had considerably too much baggage. The arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she  paid the extra fees. Then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. Not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight, others were way too large. After 20 more minutes I asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. This was not possible, I was told. Eventually another economy desk opened; yet our queue remained immobile for a  further 15 minutes. Finally after more than 40 minutes, someone decided we  should be processed at an economy  counter after all! Looking forward to a drink in the lounge, I then discover there is no lounge airside. As for the LHR-ORD flight, I have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. To board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch  is just 31"" was a major shock. This is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. The worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. The meal was OK and the IFE had a decent selection of movies. But overall, the flight was hugely uncomfortable. With some other carriers still offering  a seat pitch greater than 31"", BA has lost my future business."
3.0,After my flight  from Vienna with  BA I was  looking for a slight improvement on  our way back ; however the  service was very . Drink service  seemed rushed with  a stewardess pouring  her entire miniature  Tomato vodka into  my drink before  pouring a drop of Tomato juice in when I  reached for a Tomato and Vodka  tasted unpalatable. Was glad to be off the plane  In all fairness.  But that one  more BA will wow me.
4.0,Slightly disappointing flight  on an aircraft  that was showing  some age. It  has very little  thought is put  in cabin decor  so it looks quite tawdry in  all fairness. Food  tasted okay -  wine and cheese  included - but  nothing to write home about. Seats weren't great for  half my height  so all in  all I was  left feeling underwhelmed - budget level  but at a  decent price
8.0,"Return and return , A321 new  for Europe seating,  the Boeing 767.  Had not flown  to Europe for  several years and wasn't looking forward  for the flight  due to the  new seat pitch  that is the  equivalent as economy.  I was fortunate  on both journeys  to secure a  spot in row  2 where you  always have extra . The only  economy seat with  extra leg room  is the emergency  room row. The  meal and drink  service was good , the service  of the crew was excellent on  this return leg."
3.0,"It appears BA  chose to adopt a “do as little as possible”  on this route,  probably due to their monopoly. The aircraft and cabin  were looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre  compared to recent business class flights  with Emirates, Etihad  and Qatar Airways.  Not excellent service  from cabin and  on deck crew.  Front seat (2K) was shockingly filthy.  Floor had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much  less filth e.g.  water /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in  fabric folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably  filthy carpet. Cabin  attendant offered me  some of the  available seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but  an IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal  service was good for food and  drink although dirty environment was off-putting.  The Veg’ meal  service improved since  I tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro,  with some nice ice cream. Return  seat 1K, and  excellent service from  cabin and flight deck crew. I'm  just grateful that this cabin is  not Tired, so  no dinner. Decided  and watch a short TV programme , found much  better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although  much less programme choice. I found  sleep comfort mediocre  with bed mode,  and got five hours of sleep.  New cabin layout  was clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for  lunch so when  we were offering  breakfast rolls I asked for my wife and my  beloved Lacto Veg ! Staff returned ashen faced, and  clearly apologising, with two neatly wrapped  individually labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service,  and a lack of joined-up thinking!  Just couldn’t make  that up. Post-flight  review found the BA customer complaints  section to be dreadful, and left  home far more disappointed with the service than at  any end of my flights."
8.0,"Flying home was  as good as the flight out. Had long delay  before depart, in part from a  sick passenger who checked in, then disappeared - one  if those mysteries about airline travel that happens from time to time.  Meanwhile a  third plane of passengers were delayed , total by  45 mins. A320  was newly refurbished and clean. So called ""new"" Club Europe seats were installed, and as  I was in  Terminal 1 it  went okay. The menu was identical to the outbound  but the beef main course was was terrific. It was the sort of meal that I would have happily paid £20 for in a quality bistro. FAs  are great. The  first FA was the sort that understand customer service. Her colleague was  close to retirement and seemed to  live on another planet most of the time. At  about half way  stage I wanted another gin and  water but they 'd run out  of both ice and proper ""glasses"". On arrival to LHR we were parked miles away from the Terminal.  The reasons was given. All in , a very  pleasant experience."
8.0,"Having boarded there was a technical  problem with air  conditioning and the  line got very  hot The cabin  attendants did offer  bottled water to  help all passengers , and delay  was only around 20 minutes. Once  aboard drinks and  snacks were served.  Everything on A319 was comfortable for  a short flight.  The GLA Airport  has parking stands  they are so  long away from  the main terminal  for pick up  flights and changes to the airport  over the past  handful of years  have increased the  parking distance. This is annoying if  they only have  small luggage and  need a quick  departure especially on  this late night  when One sees  Emirates and Ryanair passengers passing through  their arrivals process  far quicker."
4.0,"- The food  was poor, my wife's steak could have been anything, my curry had a tiny piece of chicken. The  cabin was less  then half full , cabin crew hadn't time to bring a glass of wine. After the meal, staff disappeared. No after dinner drink offered, no refreshments during the night. For  this price this could have been a lot better.  Food on old  days was better."
2.0,"This is my 3rd flight with  them in 8  months and  the worst yet. The customer service and communication is appalling. Originally my return flight was from Rome to London Gatwick but my flight was  delayed due to issues at Rome . But instead of BA getting  to contact with  us in regards to this, the third party company I booked the  ticket with had to. When Checking  arrived they tried  to charge me for baggage again although already paid ! When I  spoke to them on the phone, they just tried to fob  it off to  their numbers even  when I called the Customer Service number. This is  another shame because  at once the  original flight and flight service was good which is surprising. But as  per result of  their rudeness, lack of communication and appalling customer service  im very unlikely to ever use  it again. "
7.0,"Jet Airways never fails to surprise.  We find the  customer lounge in  BA quite reasonable and on this last occasion was impressed with the manner in which the Lounge Manager handled a cranky passenger who was accusing him of destroying her favourite newspapers. Then, once  again I discovered that Business Class  and some of BA's European routes have a seat-pitch that almost prevents gaining entry to the window seats! For those used to flying Qantas  in economy in , think of  one forward seat in economy with the middle seat kept empty: and that's it! On  any other hand, service and food was excellent and  their flight crew commentary was superb. BA have an excellent in-flight magazine."
3.0,"I was delayed  3 hours -  and was given  no notice, but  I had to  miss my connecting  plane and ended  out with a  bit more time  to Heathrow than  normally would have  had Check-in was  good and cabin  crew attentive, food  good - but  BA do have  a issue with  BA The 747  seat tapers at  your back -  so not enough room for 3-4-3  - and rows  farther on have  this configuration. Rows  4 don't have  enough room for  additional seating either,  but BA do  it anyway by  deliberately making the  front seats narrower  then the rest.  having endured a  12 hour night  sleep in one  or these horrible  chairs my back  got twisted and  cramped for weeks  - This is  just not acceptable  for a long-haul  aircraft especially at  JFK - BA  charged extra for  seating identified as  needing more room,  for the same  way these seats  could be advertised  for having less  space and cash-back  available for anyone  wanting to accept  it (small children,  or"
8.0,"Short hop from  an empty terminal 1 at LHR  at LUX. Nice  to be able  and use the  facilities in LHR,  after an aggravating  delay at security despite virtually no line. Excellent service on board, off , plane at LUX, through passport control and in the car in  just 10 minutes. I was impressed  at the cheerful  attitude of cabin staff."
3.0,"So I was rather disappointed to  discover that my early morning Sunday flight was cancelled  no any reason  on the afternoon before the morning I was to  depart - the whole point of  this trip was so I could  actually go back  or return the same day to attend my sisters  wedding saving time and also money  thanks to the trains being so  delayed I managed to rearrange my  accommodation for the  first night and while annoyed I had to now  change last minute accommodation, I thought  this would be  ok and as  easy as re-booking  this was via  my BA app.  Where it didn't  help me was  that the flight  was re-arranged to fly out with  was severely delayed and my heart  sunk as I  received a a text/app notification telling  me so - I think this was very sneaky  enough to mention before re-booking and  I spent a  lot of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The  usual feedback from here and from  passengers is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a  premium service airline  this is simply unacceptable - more  than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes  important The plane itself was immaculately  dressed and clean and I liked the simple but  spacious cabin. BA staff also do  tone things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather  harsh when there are issues as there was here.  The Crew were  great but lack warmth of some  American Airlines. Sadly  they aren't any  other options on this route, so  will probably be switching back to rail, despite sometimes competitive fares."
7.0,"On to Santorini.  Plane was busy , but then  flying often is.  We left about  10 minutes late  ( this was  based on congestion.  I guess we  were stuck with  this excuse for  these next 10  years until they build a 3rd runway). Plane was  pretty clean. We  landed in Club  Economy (new seat  was in row ). I am  sure we were  in rows 2,3  which looked very  good The only  difference with economy  is the table  - in the  back - instead  of a seat.  This was very  nice indeed. I  tried the Thai  buffet - my  friend had the  side of beef  which she said  tasted excellent. FAs  are very friendly.  Beautiful flight all  this way. Its  sort of worth  my extra money  we guess -  extra privacy and  just one WC  on the front end of the plane. It could  just be so much better, with  better seats and  doing away with  this silly central ""table""."
10.0,"Fantastic from the word go. Check  in was great,  VIP lounge great  even with the  full elemis treatment which was lovely.  Great service and  eye to detail.  People onboard delightful.  Everyone was nice , was a  great pleasure."
1.0,"After flying many,  several times, I  could honestly say  BA was the  best plane I  had ever flown . The aircraft  is old and  falling apart. During the flight the  lid of the toilet flew off,  half of the  overhead bins was  smashed and the  frame holding the  bins was broken.  The carpet was  ripped and the equipment was being  held together with . They did  NOT have enough  oxygen and nothing available for me  I have a  peanut allergy), the  equipment that was  used was not  fit for human consumption. The toilets  was not cleaned  throughout the whole  journey (13 hours),  so as a  bonus the smell  out there was ! The rubbish  bin was overflowing  from waste, which  was soiled nappies. The only time  I saw the cabin crew was  when they were serving food. They looked very scruffy, not what you would expect of  the BA cabin ! All in all a very  disappointing flight. I  return to Asia  every year and  would ensure I  will fly BA  on this route  again"
9.0,"Very good flight in Club World from start to finish. OK, so the plane may be rather old,  yet it was in immaculate condition and the cabin crew (older, mostly British) delivered efficient  work and friendly service. The lie flat bed (I took a rear facing window seat) is excellent for  privacy and gives great privacy. The food offering was not amazing (some cost cutting here) and I was surprised to see nuts served in bags not on dishes. There was however a good selection of drinks and glasses were topped up as required. Inflight entertainment was excellent, with a great range of both movies and TV shows. I fly often with the middle eastern carriers who offer newer planes and a more  modern feel, however BA scored highly on crew, seat comfort and ease of sleeping. I also visited the  beautiful T3 arrivals lounge which is first class. I will definitely fly BA club world again if the price is competitive."
1.0,"A good experience.  Italy owns Vueling/Iberian  who booked me  in to Rome.  When they try to book you  onto this airline  but no. No  spare room, no  and never again.  After two weeks  in Europe I  was really looking  forward to going home to my  parents When I  eventually got to  my BA counter in the Rome airport, I was  told my flight  from London was  cancelled I would  never be able  to make my  dinner in London and I would  have to spend the night and fly out in  early morning. At  a BA desk  i was told they had a  room for me  in walking distance.  Since I'm 70 , I would  walk more like,  walking distance if  not a camel.  The room and  meal were fine,but when I went  in the restaurant  where my meal  arrived I was given a menu with three items on it, told  you could have  two for free but be charged  like any other  meal I had  saved extra to  clear my aisle  after months in  Italy but now  we had to  book again (BA  would have done  that one day  in advance of  my flight, middle  price for my 12 hours of  travel home to  London"
6.0,"Welcome to BKK June 13th 2015  BA World (Business). While the aircraft  is starting to  look its age, seats were reasonably  comfortable - as  far as you don't mind the  unusual seating configuration where some passengers  are facing backwards.  Customer service and  breakfast quality were  outstanding - with  two of the  best breakfasts we have had in  commercial air - a delicious fruit  sandwich followed by a 'full english' which was hot  and tasty. On this overnight flight, sleep was difficult  - due to  the narrowness of the seats. BA  cannot provide a  seat 'topper' as  many other airlines offer to enhance sleep comfort. Fair  values for money proposition."
8.0,"UPDATE 15/6/15. There was a delay,  that I understand and accept.   The crew were  incredibly helpful and went out of  there way for me and my travelling companion as we were due to make a  rather tight connection to travel home by other means. It was unfortunate that my travelling companion's bag didn't make it on  her outward journey, particularly as our break was only  two days long and we had  made travelling plans for the day after arrival."
6.0,"Just flew from  Amsterdam to London,  economy class and  was surprised how  far better the  plane was than  my first. It 's interesting and  comfortable and attractively . If only  they would abandon  the bizarre seat configuration in business, it would be  really good. The  service was OK,  albeit a bit  cramped but it is embarrassing to  see the attendants  scrolling down the screen every time you need anything.  Or find your  face inches away  and that of  some stranger. Fortunately,  we now know  which seats to  take to avoid  bending over my  seat to reach  my aisle."
10.0,"Just flew out  on the 8th June 2015 and  everything I can  report is that  their staff, flight  and service was  great We had  a little issue with the flights  as the people  that booked it  and made an  offer on our  flight but BA  sorted this out  with no time.  You will definitely  be flying out with them again . I will recommend them. Service  of the plane  were excellent. "
9.0,"I fly with this airline almost every other weekend from Abu Dhabi to Muscat. Throughout (I think so  with 7 trips  with them), they have never had any delays with me, and even  if there has been, it would  be a maximum 30 minutes (and still be able to arrive in  Dubai on time). Staff are professional, yet friendly enough to chat to. It would be  great if there  was a flight from Muscat to  Ab Dhabi at an earlier time  the only ones  for now is one that arrives at midnight). The only downside to  the airline is  all the Highlife shopping is not available for that Abu Dhabi - Muscat due to the short duration, even if you  ordered and paid  all the items  purchased and were  hoping for an onboard delivery."
6.0,"Ended up on  this 25-year-old 747,  and second-oldest in BA's fleet, and boy did it show. The cabin was seriously dated and in need of a good renovation, but I guess this aircraft will be retiring  one day soon. The outbound flight was on a nicely retrofitted 777 : comfortable spacious chairs and excellent, clear and larger IFE screen. The screens on this 747 were tiny and and very  low resolution by comparison. Nevertheless, the service was usual good BA standard: courteous and efficient, with decent enough food (better than  some past years, when revolting soggy  meals seemed to  be the norm).  Despite the ancient , not-up-to-standard aircraft, the flight was pleasant enough."
9.0,"Flight were boarded , but suffered  a weather delay  of over an  hours because of  severe thunderstorms. Throughout this time, the  flight crew kept  everyone updated and  after about 30 ml water/juice were  provided before being  informed that we 'd soon be  ready to depart.  Our cabin was clean and the  staff friendly and polite with apologies  about the delay. Breakfast snack just ok but only  for short flight.  So my view  is in general  good short haul , but really  need to improve  on long haul ."
1.0,"Terrible. Flight time  is well over  2 hours. Seating is like Ryanair,  but we are  in BA Club Europe. Which genius decided that 30  minutes is sufficient for premium passengers?  no idea what  I do with  the legs. It's  difficult to use my laptop. This  was not business ! Very uncomfortable , especially for the money I  spent BA -  Chris"
8.0,"28th May 2015,  flight B747, Seat 29A.  Paid  no extra for Legroom seat which  looks good though the width is  quite narrow.   Passenger in seat next to me kept fidgeting And her arm kept twitching into mine the whole flight which was annoying.  Flight was on time and cabin crew were all very friendly.  The Food also  looked pretty good for economy.  747 is really showing her age now, though the cabin was clean, tidy and in good condition, it was old in  appearance and very noisy.  The entertainment system is also quite long in the tooth with a small, blurry, screen.  Pretty good flight though."
9.0,"9/6/15, ORD-LHR, 777-300, Club World, Seat 13b.  Had  flown as World Traveler Plus but was upgraded pretty  close to departure. This meant I did not have  enough time to  get a meal before hand and the meal on  arrival was both small and not very good.  Would have been better with the economy mean I think. Breakfast was pretty poor as  usual with
several items not given out. Other than that the crew were excellent and very attentive.  The seat was full lie flat though pretty narrow I  guess compared to other carriers Business  The Entertainment system was also very  nice and up to date. "
9.0,"10/6/15, LHR-GLA, A321, Seat 9A.   Was able to  select this seat  from advance which  gave plenty of legroom as no seat in front. Â Flight was pretty full.  Cabin crew were  both extremely friendly and helpful welcoming every passenger individually.  Flight was delayed by difficulty in storing the silly amount of  carry on baggage people brought on board.  Some stuff was obviously way bigger than the allowed size. .. It took ages to get it all sorted  and was ridiculous, however the crew  kept smiling though  and all.   Had new configuration seating which I  find pretty comfortable.  Drink and snack was served as usual.  Landed nearly 30 mins late to  find my baggage had not made it from GRR  and was quite  disappointing  Overall good flight though."
10.0,"In May 2015,  an A321 (new ), Seat 4A.  Flight was on time and  about half full.  I've read complaints about the  aisle seating however found it to  remain comfortable and  available  Drink and snack service  is fine and  the cabin crew  was all very friendly."
4.0,"Once on A319,  We sat on  a plane at  departure gate for  almost 40 minutes due to one  door closed, no drinks offered. No  evening meal for my wife, Empty  seat under the  front seat tray. Landed allegedly almost  record time due to the excessive  delays scheduled for  that leg."
5.0,"Flew Club World  From Gatwick to  Southampton in April to connect with a cruise back to Europe. Arrived on a Norwegian flight from Stockholm at Gatwick the day before and were able to check in luggage the evening before the flight to avoid any delays, next day very quiet, efficient check-in in economy section. Missed Club World check-in. Next day very efficient priority security straight to lounge. Very crowded but found seats eventually. Ordered champagne delivered promptly but it was difficult  to get a refill as staff a bit overwhelmed so fixed own G&t. Boarding on B777 efficient and shown to 2 back facing seats, basically a double bed. Glass of champagne provided as we settled in. Take off a little strange as traveling backwards but when in cruise no problem at all. Several drinks services before and during meal service. Very relaxed and very professional crew. Food mackerel pate and steak quite good but not business class in its heyday which  I was privileged to enjoy. The seat was strange. Very narrow and a lot of the time you are looking into a strangers face. BA has 8 across seating, more than any other business class operating the B777 in the World. Entertainment ok. Reasonable screen but hardly World Class. Things going fine until, 3 hours from touchdown they said that champagne was finished as they had to save enough for returning passengers. What about we passengers who had paid a lot of their own money to fly Club as a special treat. We persuaded a very nice first Class CA to raid first Class to provide a glass  of champagne. After that we were on our own with the Club ! What a joke. Packets of crisps and a choice of red or white.  Very poor indeed for business Class. All in all an ok flight with a very good crew but signs of penny pinching throughout. Oh dear BA, how you have deteriorated."
8.0,Flight from Kiev  via London on  a Airbus 319 in Business Class.  Standing room was not so good but otherwise seats ! Food served was good. We departed on time  but arrived 10  mins early. Immigration queue in Terminal 5 was very long and slow and my bag was waiting for me once I got through. A nice flight.
8.0,"This is more of a general  observation having travelled almost exclusively with BA longhaul as a family for the past 3-4 years. I highly  commend BA for  everything On our travels I have found the BA staff inflight: 1)  to be sympathetic towards my wife and I with having infants. They have offered quiet areas during service (on the A380) to help settle our baby. Left us to last for dinner service if we were in the middle of settling the kids (nothing worse that being made  to take a tray of food when all you want is your kids to sleep). 2) Friendly and attentive, but maintaining professionalism. Crew are not servants to passengers. They have a fairly strict roster of duties to attend to but I find that they are more than happy  for help at the less peak  time They are less inclined when they have 300 people to feed. It figures. I  am fortunate to regularly travel longhaul  on business and so reach Silver tier on an annual basis. Having BC check-in is a great bonus for checking in a family - shorter queue etc. The greatest perk  is that as Silver I get  two bags at 32kg each. Not only that but when I travel with my family, my wife and eldest child get the same allowance as I do and our infant gets 23kg bag. Plus car seats , pram free. That is a huge allowance and makes packing less  stressful BA are a professional outfit and get you where you are going, I have no issues with them and find them value for  investment I could  not care less  how the food is like. I fly to be on time and  have good connections.  The T5 is  excellent"
7.0,"LHR to YVR return. Hard earned Avios points trip. Had been 3  years since I 'd travelled Club World and not  a changed. The  airport at Heathrow  is very crowded.  At Tea time  with just sandwiches,  tea and soup . Sandwiches were  delicious and very  comfortable Plane as a 747 that  had seen better . The seat  was clean but tired looking. The biggest let down , the screen  which was blurry  and comparison to  my Bling Airways  seats I had  on economy. The  breakfast meal was really nice. Beef  Stew that was  fresh and cooked.  Chicken Salad full of flavour and  vegetable starter that  we wanted more of. The 2nd  dinner was ""afternoon "" of 3  small sandwiches and  1 piece of  the rocky road.  A real cream  cheese would have  worked better! Seat  is upright and  great sleeping position. Got plenty of rest and sleep both ways. Coming  into the lounge , Vancouver is above the gate.  Not enough seats.  Good snacks. Another nice meal on board, spoilt by a dry bread roll. Breakfast was  another big disappointment. Expecting a cooked  hot breakfast we  ate fruit in  a plastic box followed by an  orange and bacon , I took  one bight of  the muffin and it mad me  not to gag. Good crews on  all legs. Bags  and out priority , big plus to BA. As a free plus  flight and surcharges , it was  great but BA need to improve if they want to lead the  market instead of being just average.  🙂"
5.0,"The World from  Home Busy flight  in the ageing  Rear Seats comfortable  as always and  a calm cabin  on the Upper . Only fault  with the crew.  Some seemed just  out of training school. Although very  helpful and friendly,  you two made  quite a few mistakes with orders  for drinks and  got nervous. Flight  off and landed . An all  too good experience."
3.0,"My review refers  from a return  journey from India  flying in Premium ! The seating  looks fine in this class and  was definitely worth  paying extra from standard economy in  terms of the  extra room. However ... where it  ends The service  comparison with Business  class I travelled out in, is  appalling The BA  cabin staff seem  and treat anybody  either flying in  First or First  or second-class citizens  who barely do  their job. That 's the awful  thing - the  experience I've had  on a long haul flight has  had me seriously  considering my choice  in carrier next time I fly  en route."
7.0,"This review concerns  BA in Business  class I'm not a fan of the BA business class seating. It's very awkward to access the aisle from a window , and also the practice of having your meals passed over a  small divider is  annoying for both the customer and the flight attendant.  That said all , the service on board was great, the stewardess looking after my  section of the cabin was chatty, friendly and couldn't do enough to help. The seat itself is OK,  nothing overly comfortable but I did manage a few  nights sleep. Food  is not great on BA though.  :)"
8.0,"3 of 3 - 747 out upper deck) 777 back. Fortunate to be a silver  customer so get to allocate seats when booking. Flights  2 out, 1  minute delay on return, reason late  landing aircraft (really  no excuse). On departure no knowledge of which gates  will be used for this and many other flights  with both main lounges by security in T5 hellishly overcrowded. Assume the remote lounges would have been empty.  737 tired with ancient entertainment system but quiet upper deck, 777 the  best except crowded and busy on  upper only deck - although both  planes have new  first class so  any upgrading had  been just not  part of it.  Service however excellent throughout in both directions so well done, particularly return  leg which had  huge number of  school children making  for demanding work. Food both directions actually quite decent, continual drinks service for first half  the flight e/w then help yourself in galley. Good  booking as we gained big discounts  by booking a  full package. Had I paid full fare would have  felt very disappointed  - doesn't near  live up to the main opposition  these days - too many seats  in an inconvenient layout. I do  wonder if BA have given up going for the  family traveller in  economy classes on some long haul  flights now (as they have for short haul club)  they now see  only higher spending families as their revenue source - maybe that's why we got the antiques to fly in."
1.0,"Travelled from Venice to Gatwick on  8 May check in staff rude , unhelpful plane seats and food trays dirty and seats very worn and uncomfortable. Lady  next to me had her arm rest fall off during the flight. Food for my daughter inedible. Attendants very lacklustre. Nappy changing table fell on my mum  while on the toilet attendant suggested we sue BA! Wrote to BA  to complain got fobbing off email  to return. Won't be wasting my money on business class again. Shocking service and standards from start to  finish"
2.0,Bad customer experience on BA flight. I have a  confirmed flights for British Airways from Singapore to Sydney for tomorrow. When  I tried to check online the system did not allow me to  check online check-in. I called the BA contact center in the UK and was shocked with the response received. The person told me that there is a difference between confirmed  tickets and confirmed seating. Essentially BA  tries to sell their seats at a premium. They arm twist the passengers and make lame excuses that although you have confirmed flight bookings it doesn't mean you can fly unless you get the seats allocation. We are travelling as a family but got scattered seats. Very embittered with the overall experience. Will never fly again with British Airways.
1.0,I had this  horrible experience of  flying British Airways  from Heathrow to  JFK The plane  was parked in  the no-mans area  before we were bussed to the  gate To my  horror I had  the climb through the stairs with  no carry on . The width of the seat  in the leg rest is the smallest I saw  throughout my 40  years of travel ! It's a  wonder that that  an airline is  using this kind  of carrier for  a Transatlantic flight. The quality of  meat is one  if the worst  we have ever seen. I picked  a non-veg chicken  because the taste and content was  horrendous The container  is marked for  shipping as 28/11/16  with an expiry  for 18 months but marked for the hour and  time The only  positive thing I  can think of  after this torture  over 9 hours  is the attitude  of service of  our cabin crew  they were great.
4.0,"Reviewed 6th June 2015. If this  were the first  experience I had  flown with British  Aerospace I would  not be impressed.  The check in  staff is a  breach of professionalism. The customer does  always come first  class at the  Economy Class check  in Staff interrupt  each other and  take their own  items in priority  before completing the  Check in. The  aircraft was in  fact delayed by  an hour despite  the information such  as was provided  such as ""ten "" The aircraft  is dated and not especially clean , crumbs on the seat and  rust marks on  the windows. The inflight shopping was  extremely difficult as  there were no  small duty free magazines available in  Business Class. Inflight  navigation system did  not work. Whilst  some food was  good it had  not be changed  as the first  flight was cold.  Flight crew were  polite and efficient.  Upon arrival the  air reclaim took  no account of  all passengers."
3.0,I flew from Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda in First.  The Concorde Lounge at Heathrow was quite good though  I was surprised by how little  choice there was  as it came  to food. The seat on the new First was . The service  seemed all right. The food on board was poor as it has  done each time  I flown First  over the years. To find something edible I had to retreat to the snack bar in business. I  was particularly disappointed because BA is still my first choice for economy  but it is fine in business  away from the bizarre seating configuration.
2.0,• Our return  flight confirmed our  belief that Club  service is a  lot of money  in this new . HER is  seen as a  product of the 70s and BA  has done nothing  to improve that.  Service was interminable  with a Club  Service desk. There  was a fast  boarding option for  passengers but this  was roped off  after our flight.  No lounge was  empty even though  there are lounges  owned and used  by other airlines.  Perhaps surprisingly there  is no priority . Our seats  1 and 2E  were the only  two seats in  our new Club  HER Service on  arrival was adequate.  This was the  same nightmare taking  20 minutes to  go through the  passport control fiasco.  I certainly wouldn't  like to repeat  the BA experience  into and from  London
4.0,I very disappointed  on my BA flight as it  is very poor. I was traveling  to GLA Glasgow-LCA  Glasgow via LHR . On my  initial flight my  tray table fell  from it hinges.  BA did gives a full breakfast though. Then on  my second flight  the middles of  the seat were  FULL of dust  or gum. Secondly  no television on the 767 was . Finally on a 5 and  1 half hour  break they gave  us a little  meat or vegetable  sandwich with a choc pud.
1.0,Anonymous 19th May 2015. Awful premium  customer service - bad old cabin  - faulty inflight  system and they  even split my  wife and I  off when travelling  home from Japan  - how is  this acceptable?
4.0,Flew from Heathrow  in San Francisco  on May 1st with BA. What a disappointment! I had to pay  over £120 to sit next to my husband having already paid for  the flight. Then  we couldn't access  any entertainment for over 90 minutes at the start of the flight due to some  mechanical problem and  then later in the flight it went off for  about 60 minutes presumably due to the same problem.  Our first meal  is served more or less straight  up and it  was OK typical airline fare but  I was then  another 7 hour  wait for the next meal which was laughably called  afternoon tea one piece of bread  cut into quarters  of chicken and a scone with cream and butter. Four hours after  my main meal they ran out of snacks and when my husband  was in search of something to  drink they gave  me two packs  and nuts and said they were for the return ! Don't they  stock up before  filling up the next passengers? Luckily  our husband always carries chocolate bars  with him as  he is diabetic  otherwise heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from  airline staff. Before half way two of the toilets  ran out of  water so there were some queues.  When I fly BA again certainly not long haul  but unfortunately I  need to return to Heathrow with them from Boston .
7.0,"Flew Eurotraveller Heathrow  to Athens and back. Both flights  being slightly delayed , departing crew  members on both  trips and being a band 4 , hot meals provided although edible the meat on  the Athens to Heathrow was indeterminable. Cabin was fairly clean on both flights however did  leave a boarding card from 24 hours previous in my seat pocket. Traveled with a  3 month old baby and at  home and on board was looked  after my only criticism which is  actually really BA's  fault was the  change in agent  in Athens (swissport)  were hesitant about letting our pushchair  get to the  toilet despite my  knowledge this had  come from London  to us and  never been an issue then!"
2.0,Flew to Tampa from Gatwick on the 12/5/15 return flight on the  BA Had flown  with BA on several occasions to Mauritius. Can't believe  from the number of complaints BA received nothing has changed regarding the food the service.  Sure some of  these are good but some of  these makes you  wonder why did they choose such career. BA seriously need to review the customer care they provide. Dinner overcooked frozen rolls  and a cereal bar for breakfast - really tasted better food on  any airline. Come on BA listen to your customer and improve your service. Very disappointed with BA.
8.0,First in World  Economy Plus (upgrade)  in a 777  or in Economy in a 747.  We got an  upgraded for the outbound flight which  is a bonus. There were a  couple niggles on the outbound flight.  Ear cancelling headphones  and the sound  quality was poor  if at maximum ! The reading light worked but  felt inadequate (probably  as it was  so far away).  Our cabin temperature  got a little  warm and there were queues for the four toilets  in economy (it  might have been  no problem if we had been  travelling through prolonged ). But as  we said these  where just niggles . I enjoyed the upgrade and  the flight. The  flight was delayed  for the APU  flight (not uncommon  in a 747).  We had to  wait for a second air starter  system (if it  was twos order  days in advance)  and it got  quite stuffy whilst . The pilot  had us informed  of what was . Once underway  it was a  smooth flight and  we rested well.  Fast and efficient  flight in both  flights Food was  provided outbound and  excellent inbound. Some  room for improvement  but overall very  good and would  thank BA.
7.0,BA873 KRK-LHR 17 May - a new sector launched just early this month and my  third time flying BA. I was pleasantly surprised (for  my friend) that he was able to check-in his big carry-on for free while I paid for check-in  and I understood why in the end. My biggest gripe has to be that the Sunday flight departs  and arrives late into LHR. This  was worsened by  a fact that it was a full flight but  our overhead bins were already full before all were  off board hence there was a 20 minute delay on the tarmac as remaining hand-carry luggage had to  get put in the hold. Unfortunately flight did not manage to catch  itself while in the air hence  BA landed 20 minutes late cutting it close to the curfew time for LHR. We had to run all the way through and almost missed the last Heathrow Express train. I will never fly a late flight into LHR again. That said the pilot and cabin crew were entertaining - quite chatty over the  radio and with some passengers though not necessarily friendly to all customers. 2.5 hours on an A320 passed  quickly without any in-flight entertainment (to be expected for regional flights) and with some food and refreshments (which  is good).
7.0,I flew LHR-PEK  on a holiday  on a 747-400.  The plane was not that busy  so the seat next to me  sat free which  was great. The  plane was clean and my seat was reasonably comfortable.  And IFE had a good selection although the small  ones on the  menu now look out of date. The meal was  excellent for economy class and the  servers were polite  & attentive.
7.0,"First off this  last flight from  Boston to LHR  & back was advertised as a  BA 787 Dreamliner.  Their actual jet  was a 777 much less comfortable.  Our flight going  into London was  3 hours delayed coming into EWR  because about a diversion regarding a sick passenger in Boston MA. In  fact they had not allocated a crew. Coming home  the pre-paid seats  had changed in  the economy to  sit next to  me so I  got the pleasure of smelling excretion  of gas the whole flight. I  was also emailed  the offer for  seat upgrade then  my email was  backed up with  something that stated  only the first  offer was sent  in error. Fact:  We did get back to the USA. Reality: BA no more -  never again. The  issue with BA is not their  flight crews who  are quite nice. The problem is , their Customer  service is a  disaster Cannot recommend this airline."
10.0,"The LGW-PUJ-LGW B777-200ER.  All flights excellent , seats tasty  meals both ways , friendly cabin . Lucky to get upgrade to  BA on return  with very nice  aircraft at its  base"
2.0,BA 10 Bangkok to London Heathrow May 26th 2015 World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy). First the positives: check-in at BKK was reasonably efficient the flight departed on time and landed at LHR about  20 minutes early. Unfortunately while World Traveller Plus provides some extra leg room when compared to economy there was nothing else about our flight experience that justified the additional cost of World Traveller . The cabin seating and equipment were tired - the entertainment system was old and barely functional. However by far the  disappointing aspect of the flight was the poor service from the cabin  attendants who almost without exception appeared uninterested in customer service to the  level of rudeness. Their strategy seemed  to be to minimise their exposure to customers in order to maximise the time they could spend in the galley at the rear of the aircraft. After the first meal service (an uninspiring  Chicken Curry with  fried to death broccoli and carrot not remotely resembling  the misleadingly optimistic descriptions found on the BA website about the supposed  exceptional dining experience of World Traveller Plus) calls for service went unanswered  over lengthy periods of time. It seemed the only effective way to obtain further service was to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being 'interrupted' barely acknowledging requests while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling requests to a bare minimum. In stark contrast to the excellent cabin service food and entertainment options we experienced flying in economy on Qantas to Bangkok the previous day this so called 'premium' experience on BA  proved extremely disappointing. Our advice: don't waste your money on BA World Traveller Plus.
1.0,ZRH-LHR. A bit of a disaster.  The flight BA  operated was delayed  20 minutes -  but so was the preceding flight.  No one is  bad - two  - well a  problem (or not). Left 90 minutes late (about 20 minutes) after the earlier late departure got stacked over  BA - landing  about 2 hours late - from  planned 80 minutes . Plane was  nearly brand new. Crew was great - but in  the end couldn't  care less. BA  did its worst. Pathetic.
8.0,A380 LHR-IAD. After a visit to the Concorde Room  our mood was  clear to enjoy  the flight which  it did. The Attendants were friendly helpful and attentive.  Our food and drinks were good though my wife was disappointed with her tasting plate.  As expected the seats and space were appropriate and  spacious The journey  continued and finished  as schedule. There  is not a  good deal of  difference between this flight and a A380 in J LA Qantas so  although no complaints I don't believe  any additional cost  was value for money.
4.0,Club World: Just flown London Gatwick to Las Vegas  via Club World and very disappointed. Staff were not particularly helpful gave the impression that everything they did they were doing  them a favour.  Limited seating of 2/4/2 in a Business Cabin is  like trying to pack too many people in. They didn't offer anything to try to make you feel a bit special and I had paid a lot of money for the tickets. I normally fly Virgin Atlantic on this route and will defiantly be using them in the future.
2.0,"I travelled on  the BA11 from  London to Singapore  last 25th July 2014 and it is most unlikely we would travel with them again.  We were supposed  to depart at  noon and had arrived early to escape the rush and heat of London. When we checked the Departures  page we noticed  a gate number  has been allotted to our flight. We hung around Gate A area and waited for further advice and  waited and waited. The clock ticked on and we  then waited for  any advice the  plane is supposed  for display. Come  back (supposed to  be boarding) and  yet no gate  information or advice  as to the  delayed boarding. I  can go on and on but  then at 2008  about 8 minutes after scheduled departure , the board  announced that we  had to go  through Gate B  again for a  late departure. Still  no explanation as to why we were an hour  later We caught  a transit service  so headed over there finally boarding  our plane after  our rescheduled departure time. The air conditioning was virtually  gone and we  were forced to  sit in the  oppressive heat waiting  for some sort of explanation and apology. The staff  were surly and disinterested in our discomfort and one  lady near us at the rear  in the plane  refused two requests  for passengers to bring water using the defence that she was ""on  her own back here and cannot  use my post"". Incredibly she left her post several times when it suited her to talk to other stewards etc! About  2100 the Captain  announced that they had ""lost a passenger and we should depart within  20 minutes"". Finally  about 2221 we  were off after sitting in the  unbearable heat and humidity of all  the bodies for over an hour with no service  or drinks or  nothing else after  being over an  hour late! Yes we departed 2  hours and 21 minutes late and still without explanation or apology of any kind from any of the  crew The air conditioning did not start to reduce  in temperature until more than 3 hours into the flight! When we  boarded at Singapore  BA Captain announced that he ""hoped  the ongoing passengers hadn't been too inconvenienced by the hold-up"". I guess that was BA's apology? Totally disgraceful  mistake andwe still  never know why  they were delayed."
5.0,Punta Cana - Gatwick. World Traveller Plus cabin on B777. I find this particular cabin  rather noisy possibly due to proximity  to the engines. Seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. The front row of World Traveller Pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. IFE was OK but nothing special. Main meal was OK but breakfast was an absolute disgrace; a dry cheese croissant and a small  breakfast bar. No alternatives offered. I know this is not business class but for the premium I paid for World Traveller Plus I feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. The drinks service was nothing special either; one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. Then nothing until breakfast. Regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. When in all innocence I used a toilet in the Business Class cabin I found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when I emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. Fair enough but when I explained that other passengers in World Traveller Plus had also used the toilets in Business Class I was virtually called a liar. I backed off from an argument but I found the experience upsetting and I simply couldn't get to sleep thereafter. I eventually disembarked at  sea hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny. In summary World Traveller Plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and  space but don't get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service.
3.0,"During a recent flight to St  Petersburg with BA , I have  a choice in  whether I will  travel with another  airline From the  beginning of the  first trip we experienced problems. Headset failed to work on reporting this to the cabin  crew I was  informed that ""you need to jiggle  it to make  a connection"" so needed to unpack  our own kit  or watch a  video Meal time the only choice  left was pasta  sauce with cheese and one without  The passenger next  to me had  the pasta it  looked like it had been re-heated with the cover  pressed very hard.  After mentioning it to the cabin  attendant all she got was ""their  hands down"" in  other areas. Re the movie this  picture quality was  in disgrace picture  the sound kept  popping up I  checked my phone  time and again  with my own  headphones to get me through the  12 hours trip.  So have cancelled  my BA membership."
1.0,While flying British  Airways is no  doubt about a  pleasant experience -  there is a  problem on a flight which you  spend a lot  of money for.  We had a number of issues  who we tried  ot get resolved via Customer Services but were told they couldn't do anything until our  flights had ended? We were very disappointed with this approach and their inability to address  any issues during our journey. BA  officials at Heathrow  fed us the wrong information about  checking our baggage  (& big issues) the plane was  extremely hot on both legs of the flight and  we were told  our cabin crew  for both flights  it is a  regular problem on  some older planes.  Our breakfast on  the return flight  was fit for  royalty - an ice cold hard croissant after 7  hours of no  sleep Really poor  experience and even worse customer services.
8.0,I treated myself to Premium Economy on my PEK-LHR flight BA38 because it was only an extra £120  as I had been on holiday  visiting North Korea  so wanted a bit of luxury. I was impressed with the legroom in the bulkhead seat and the PE cabin was not very full. The cabin crew were polite and attentive and the food was good however it seemed to be the same as the Economy food just with a fancy menu card. I was impressed with the seat recline and the footrest and I got  the lot of sleep even though it was a  long flight. The IFE malfunctioned for the first half of the flight which seems a common occurrence on BA 747s. Staff were apologetic and gave us complaint forms to fill in.
9.0,From BA056 May 13 2015. LHR-JNB  on May 23  2014 on the  Emirates A380. Departed  & landed on ! Friendly flight  experience and fairly comfortable seats. Food not exactly 5 star but I  dont have very high expectations either. Overall no complaints at all and I will definitely  try BA again!
10.0,"Sent Out 3rd  Way Back 12th . First both  ways Outstanding experience.  Staff and security  all through. Concorde  Nice - quiet - comfortable- food  excellent Boarding very  comfortable Superb flight-seats , food great  Very good. Crew ! Straight through . Exactly same  in return. 777 both ways Will  definitely fly with  them again. Could  it have been ."
3.0,"The A320 on one of BA's  many tourist-orientated routes. Sadly this felt more like a charter flight with screaming kids in  a row behind , appalling hot  seat and the penny-pinching 'new' Club Europe seats which are identical in width and pitch to economy. If this is the  route BA are going it doesn't make sense to  spend the extra. They really should think again about  offering premium service."
7.0,"Gatwick to Florida : Flight out  is quite good  and an attentive crew 3 choices of meals found , seatback TV  is very small  and selection of movies and audio  quality was poor  it could be a lot better  done and I  feel that BA need to update their B777 on  the route. Return  trip was delayed  3 hours but  once informed by  my airline by  telephone and email  after check-in a  couple vouches was given to buy  water or a snack i found  the food on  my return flight very poor with  little chicken or pasta available and the breakfast consisted  was a stale  bread and jam  and a raisin  roll that was  quite indelible I  will consider flying  BA to Florida  even if their  meals are comparable to other carriers."
7.0,"The Husband and  me had middle  class both outbound  to return. We  found seats comfortable for seating and sleeping. Crew on  return were a  lot more efficient and friendlier than  the inbound crew  though the service  is a bit  slower and one  female crew member  that was a  few years older  that the others was rather offhand and didn't smile  back at all.  Luckily there were  open seats all  about us so  we did not  want to sit face to face  as strangers or climb over anyone  before leaving our seats but cabin  was quite full , so we  did not enjoy  the flight as  usual The Club  A cabin is  extremely cramped compared  to other business class cabins and  I do not  see what BA  were thinking when  BA decided to  squeeze in so  few seats and  to such a  layout as to  making it very awkward for less  fortunate passengers to  leave their seats. Storage space is  scarce around the  aircraft due to  people trying to  squeeze too many  items into too small a space.  This would not  say I would  ever travel Club  Economy with BA again but would  look at alternative  airlines with different cabin layouts first."
9.0,On returning Barcelona-Gatwick. Excellent flights as  usual Especially loved the stylish and  comfortable interiors of the refitted A319  and the Naples . Both flights  arrived late but  that didn't seem  too seriously affect  departure time. Only  problem is the  quick service sandwich is not to  my taste and  they now refuse  it - but  some passengers seem  happy Should offer  some alternative such  as crisps or  chips to go  on wine.
8.0,Business Class Tampa - Gatwick. Fantastic service and attentive staff. However seat  12 feels very claustrophobic you also  need to step over the footrest of 11b if you want to  get to the loo or take  a wee walk during the flight.
9.0,"Thanks Avios to  take return flights  to Grenada. Previously  flying this route in business class , the food  choices and champagne ran out. Same  story with the food choices ie only four scallop  meals between 7 , some people  could have paid  the full fare  of £3400. Champagne flowed freely and  service was excellent.  Did just as well in business  class engine noise  is greater in  first class and  the baby did  NOT help either.  All these niggles  business class lived  out to its  billing and great  use for money  when not paying  more for it!"
8.0,LHR-SEA World Traveler : As a BA Executive Club member I was able to use the Club bag  facility where there was no queue. The Fast Track security staff were  friendly and patronising. The Gold/First lounge  was busy and at times uncomfortably hot. Boarding from  Gate C Gates  was well organised. On taking my  seats I was  offered a water or orange juice. The 777-300 has the newish seats that were quite  nice except for the headrest which  does not have adjustable wings. The  experience was helped  with the fact  that I had been able to  use an emergency exit row aisle  seat (22B). Departure was on time. Bar service was  provided before and with the meal. I had used the facility available on this route to pre-order my  first course. Overall  the meal was  very good. The Mixed Fleet staff  wisely avoided the bizarre practice on some other carriers  by closing the window blinds after the meal service. The seat was  little bit stiff in adjusting to  its recline. The  back support cushions  proved useless as  they did not move far enough to make contact  between my legs.  Lunch passed quickly as the entertainment system was very  good A reasonable snack of sandwiches and a scone was served about an hour before landing. We arrived a the gate  slightly ahead of schedule. Immigration bag collection and customs  was completed in under half an hour.
9.0,Sent from Jeddah on BA132 in  the World on  Boeing 777-200ER. To be honest I  have no complaints.  The service was  excellent Cabin crew  making sure I  felt comfortable throughout  entire flight and  provided drinks to  get me and  I pax hydrated.  Flight crew were  extremely polite and  my Flight departed  on time and  arriving at LHR  ahead of schedule. Would I fly BA again? Of  Course
8.0,"18 May 2015. These flights were on BA's newly configured A320's we  opted for Emergency  middle row seats  in both ways  were very thankful that we did British Airways have  expanded the legroom in both Economy  and Business class to 30"" and  from 6'1 the  extra legroom now is quite tight.  the seats themselves  are quite comfortable , having storage  in the top  for the seats  means you don't lose your legroom.  Food service on board was excellent , staff both  way provided with a wrap roll  coffee and biscuits , a chocolate  shake both ways  although not as  bad as outbound and they offer complimentary drinks. Looking  for business class , you get  in the middle seat free and no extra legroom  plus lounge and a hot meal so wouldn't think it's worth the upgrade fee anymore  Having travelled many  years in club  seats BA new product is not  a winner from  what I could . I would  choose British Airways again and would  recommend them."
9.0,Our BA72 and  we Departed 14th May returned 20th May 2015. Very  satisfied with flight  to cabin service on our trip  via Dublin to  Oman Oman both in Club Europe and Club World.  Got a bit  annoyed from reading  the reviews however  did not fault the service. Our flight was not busy so maybe  that helped however I am looking  forwards to my  Oman trip. Would  go again.
10.0,Flight First - Club World: Check-in  from Toronto was  quick with very nice and friendly ground staff. Used  room in Lounge  and I was  amazed who good the food was from starter to  finish The service  was excellent too.  On boarding friendly  flight staff was waiting and I was escorted to my seat. Cabin crew and cabin staff director introduced themselves personally to  each passenger in  Business Class. I  asked the friendly  flight crew to  wipe down my  bag when I  had put on the pyjamas so I could go  for sleep. This flight was again  my confirmation that  our first class  has improved and it has been  good on all my last flights . First. Landed  on time in LHR. Used the reserved Cabana in Concorde room and enjoyed an excellent breakfast. Boarding on  the full flight  from Brussels was a little chaotic but it was  a excellent flight with fantastic cabin  with decent food and a clean  flight
8.0,Met with my  family from Barbados  via London Gatwick . Tuesday's overnight . Boarding by  limited numbers was  nicely co-ordinated. Staff  to board were polite and efficient.  Cabin in premium  seats is relatively comfortable. The extra  comfort is appreciated  on longer flights.  Fuel is still below standard Was  given a breakfast pineapple yoghurt which  we had to eat with a  sharp knife! Flight arrived 15 mins . Will fly  with BA again.
10.0,"LGW-AGP Club Europe.  Cabin staff were  extremely cheerful and friendly. Told them  i lost my  VIP pass and was reissued another one. BA Business Lounge in Gatwick  was good but could be better.  a little crowded.  Service was very  friendly Cabin crew  very friendly and enthusiastic. Drinks and nuts offered straight  after take off.  Hot tea followed.  Light drinks offered.  The crew interacted with passengers. Landing  was very smooth , arrived 10  minutes early. Aircraft  interior was a  bit old but  spacious cabin gave  this aircraft a  nice feel."
8.0,BLQ-LGW and return.  Flight by A319 clean tidy and  in a spacious  seat The service  on the desk  staff from the  ground crew was  very smart and  professional Both flight  times on time  and both landing  was great. I 'd fly again !!
1.0,"This flight on  a long distance  between the Austin  and Heathrow was  THE most uncomfortable  I had on  this carrier and  may have travelled ! The seats  are so close  up with hardly any leg room  for arm movement  that not only  made it difficult  the eat the  sandwich which was  delicious but very  hard to get in and out of without damaging  and twisting a  leg or back.  We had extreme  turbulence on landing  causing discomfort and  loss of sleep. The evening meal we were served was inedible. The  meal had been  carried around for some time by  the appearance. It  looked dry and  coated in what  was once tomato  sauce The foil container was bent  so the foil  had crumpled which proves it had  been handled and  used up frequently. As for the  food in a  row it was  not bad I  cannot comment. We've had better food and seating on  many budget airlines and as well , on Myanmar Airlines! We want  to support our  local airline but  certainly not on  an economy. It  seems all the attention and care  being given to  first and business class. A huge  disappointment"
1.0,"BA 138 13/5/2015.  BA 273 13/5/2015. Just completed my  first BA Flight  in Club World. The experience can be summed up  in a single  sentence - ""pathetic"".  My flight taxied , took off with passengers sleeping  in their seats , in the centre ""couples seat"".  The crew was totally indifferent. The  complimentary meal post  take off was  available only to passengers in the aisle seats for reasons best known to the crew. If you are  seated in the  centre ""couple seats""  there have to be either an  adult or a  taxi to access  the toilets as you have to  climb over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there. The  pilot requested to  transport us to  a lounge at Heathrow as my wife had just had surgery showed  up but the lady driving it  said we did not need it and walked off as a result  I had to trek for 2 hrs to clear  out and reach  the lounge. Will never travel BA again."
7.0,LGW - Antigua  - LGW. Easy  checked in at the Club World  counter and then quickly through security . Unusually for BA at Gatwick boarding was very well organised and we were quickly on board the  Boeing 777 - 200. Water or  tea was offered prior to take  out along with  a hot towel. We pushed back from the stand at exactly our departure time and  were airborne about 10 minutes later. I can't say  the seats were  the most comfortable I have ever  been on but  having extra leg room in PE  does help. Two drinks rounds were served one before and one with . The food was just about OK although I never have any great expectations so  I am rarely disappointed. However the size and picture quality of the TV screens was very poor and  was a result I decided to  sit for most of the journey. The cabin crew overall were very professional and as  per result we had a good  flight The return flight was pretty much the same  and despite being being bronze exec card holders we  got refused permission  to check in  through the Club World desk which as it turned out didn't make  any difference. Overall another good experience with BA bar the few issues that I have mentioned.
2.0,Over the last  handful of years  i have travelled  around China by Emirates KLM Virgin Atlantic and BA.  But next time I travel BA  should be my  only choice. I got the impression  at the very start that BA are penny pinching at every opportunity.  All lounges are  tiny and the food minimal. Although having a seat on the plane only a few  doors down from the front some meal selections had run out. The cabin staff hid behind curtains most  of the flight  and service was at a minimum. If you have  no window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside  row if you  wish to get out.
10.0,Fly from Heathrow  to Washington in  April on one  of the new  Boeing planes. Extremely  pleased with the plane even in economy the seats  feel quite spacious and the storage  bins at the  end of the  seat are a big plus. The  service on board  was good and  the meals were pretty good. The plane arrived exactly  in time too!  Best in all one of the  quickest flights I've  taken
8.0,LHR to Istanbul - excellent service on the outbound flight on what  became a very busy flight. Cabin crew worked very hard and consistently.  The management on the ground and for boarding excellent cabin crew. T5  was ok but  their food soon ran out and rather slow in service.
6.0,Brilliant service from  the cabin crew  & Captain/First Officer on this much delayed Lisbon-LHR flight. BA have questions to answer -  on Lisbon-LHR flight  that was heavily  booked (this happens  with another BA flight from Lisbon  with a remote boarding location and  bad management prior  of boarding. Our two hour delay - all after  passengers had boarded - was handled  beautifully by the crew with regular communication refreshments and as jovial atmosphere as was possible. But BA must face up to  its astonishingly poor  service in Lisbon the poor management  during boarding and a limp response  of questions.
10.0,Business class. Scheduled to fly from Rome to Gatwick on 7 May on BA2543. The day that the  blaze broke out at Rome airport. We had a 12.45pm flight. I received a text from BA at 6.30am advising of flight cancelled due to the fire and to contact BA. I called them and they rebooked us on flight BA555 at 8.15pm but direct to Heathrow. We accepted the flight change considering and lounged around Rome  in the morning. Than when about to get the train to Rome airport received a text from BA advise that flight had been changed to Naples and  that we wanted that flight to make our way to Naples. So we high tailed it onto a train and in 2 hours we were in Naples. The flight did not leave till 9.30pm as they were waiting on others who had made the trip to Naples and out of 152 seats on the plane about 130 people made the trip to Naples. I think the communication and the effect that BA did to get us out of Rome under the circumstances was excellent. A friend was flying to Paris from Rome on another airline and he was delayed till midnight and his luggage was  supposed to accompany them and was delivered 2 days later to him. Once on board in Euro Business class it was all pamper. The meal was excellent of rockmelon with truffle infused coleslaw and BBQ style prawns. Finished with a rhubarb and custard desert and washed down with a lovely Spanish white. Once landed bags were quick out on the belt and away we went. So well down BA for what I know for others  turning out to be a nightmare.
8.0,"We seem to  be trying harder  as customer service  being more friendly  - and efficient.  This helps as  this is a  small terminal. Flew  into economy LHR . Denver flight  worked out so  I upgraded to  premium Economy. Positives  - Small cabin , 1st class  and Business makes it very exclusive , quiet (747  class 1) with  few through traffic  from other passengers.  Food service -  cold drink newspaper  paper towel menu  Noise cancelling headphones  and blanket and  seat better food  in economy (steak)  seat selection etc.  No flight attendant for the whole  flight but he  was super efficient.  Front Attendant was  very - friendly  but with none  like the BA  issues that some  call Toilet just  not premium economy.  The 747 aircraft  are old and  passengers can feel  it Inflight entertainment  - ancient small screen limited selection  on both video  & music Seat  Comfort and functionality , but not Air NZ. Toilet  also remains BA  black heel -  we just don't  find them clean vs. Asian airlines.  The product is  vastly improved from  other times I  have taken it."
10.0,"Madrid-London City return.  Great experience. Flights  no time in fact 25 minutes  flying into LCY and arrival and departure procedures at both MAD and LCY fast and efficient. The Velazquez Lounge at MAD  airport is extremely comfortable and well-appointed with a good range of food , drink. Flight on a newish  new aircraft clean ly and spacious.  Excellent service from the two friendly  British and Spanish  speaking cabin crew. Full English breakfast with champagne and  orange juice on  flight outbound and a nice chicken dinner with good wines on the return."
10.0,"19 April KWI-LHR BA157. LHR-EDI BA1454. 3 May EDI-LHR BA1459. LHR-KWI BA156. KWI-LHR-EDI-LHR-KWI: booked World  Economy Plus (Premium Economy) but upgraded to Club World (Business Class) on the outward trip. An excellent experience: as always the cabin crew make the difference. On  both sectors professional well-turned-out staff who were genuinely friendly cheerful and helpful. Food was excellent (chicken or pasta seem to be a thing of the past - I was not offered either) nicely presented and for me in sufficient  supply Water/orange juice runs on a regular basis washrooms clean and tidy and well-stocked A wide range of entertainment on the KWI-LHR sector (it kept me entertained for a 6-hour flight and because I flew out in April and back in May the selection had changed on the return flight). Smooth flights (the 747's on the KWI-LHR sector although old were well- maintained and everything worked - I really enjoy flying the ""Queen of the Skies"") and plenty of information from the flight deck. Slight delay outbound at Kuwait because of a technical problem but it was resolved: all other sectors were on time. I travelled on a Sunday in both directions so no delays in connections at Heathrow although I had built in sufficient time between flights to allow for delays when I booked my ticket. All in all four  excellent flights - BA seem to 've improved immensely since I last flew with them in 2014: the cabin crew and check-in staff seem to make the difference and for this reason I use BA in preference to the carriers from the Middle East especially as Terminal 5 at Heathrow is a very civilised place to transfer (at least in my experience)."
9.0,"Flight DXB-LHR Club  checked in seat . Very nice  with no bother from anyone stepping  around you and  sat right next  door the loo . CW kitchen  had great access  and snacks. Also  because I was at the front  of the cabin I got off  that plane nice  and speedily. Food  was good had  some nice vegetarian  chicken main course.  In the afternoon , I got  offered plenty of  drinks as most people surprisingly didn't  want them!"
5.0,BRU-LHR-YYZ: CLUB Europe - Club World; This time again check-in was smooth with friendly ground staff the best  seats in this lounge. Boarding was easy friendly cabin crew was waiting for us to  check jackets. Hot towels tasting breakfast landed on time. This short flight 10/10. Security in Heathrow was horror . I prefer the horror of waiting than the horror of terror. First lounge was a breeze. Boarding for the flight to Toronto was with busses driving us to the Dreamliner. Indeed the business seats are smaller. It really  looks bad. The flight was not comfortable at all as I left the plane with pain in the back and shoulder. The crew were excellent the food was excellent and the screens are improved. But the space you have is really a shame. As a gold member I fly often business or first but the club world seats in the Dreamliner are really smaller and not comfortable at all. I will avoid this plane in future. I am so happy I will fly back in a 777.
2.0,"9 April return May 14. Another  flight to try the A380 product . all seemed well online check in bag drop sensible loading on the air bridge at LAX but  before we boarded a self important flight attendant decided  she had to  review the boarding  procedures to ensure we were on the right plane  on the right day. No you do not we have been checked all the way along. Still even  that pitiful attitude  could not dampen  this sterling job done by the  crew of flight attendants we had. They gave Mixed Fleet a very good name. Now having got through everything needed on  our trip we  boarded the return.  Ok so the food was OK the thing is during the trip the LAX sector had reverted back to the legacy staff. Disaster. The staff tried until  nearly half way  through the flight , a woman who spoke with  the brogue I  think Eire arrived to take charge  and declared the bar closed. So too were snacks of crisps etc. Half way through a long flight? BA claim the bar service and snacks are available throughout the flight. Clearly they are  spreading lies. This poor creature shut things because she had counted everything.  So if BA wish to lie to us we will not be  buying from their  Best Life Shop. It cuts both ways. So to sum up most BA staff really  do try to  make passengers (the customers) enjoy the experience; certainly I have always flown BA where possible however when one employee on each sector can colour the experience in  such a negative manner I shall not be rushing to fly them . Closing the bar and snacks  for less than  three hours on  a flight of  over eleven hours?  Then Fly to  the Self Serving.!  I really can no longer recommend BA."
10.0,Fly from Heathrow  7 May BA543  to Bologna. Return  6 May BA545. Flew return LHR  to BOL. It  is a long  time since I 've flown with  Emirates and I 'm reminded just  what good they  look I really  cant fault any  one of the  staff from the  best in staff  through the cabin  crew and seat ! Every aspect  was highly professional.  Also was impressed  with terminal 5  and think it  gives an excellent  overall impression of  it
9.0,"Got to CPT  room first (777 ). Concorde room  - always quiet , private with  good bar service  ( did not  enter the restaurant)  had wonderful views  from the terrace  lots of natural . Boarding by  suspension bridge. A warm welcome greeted  by name and  directed to my  seat by a  senior member of . Offered a glass of champagne , bag and night suit. Departure  & arrival on time. Food and beverages very good  (& bloody Mary). Bed was made  with staff with  soft mattress provided.  Overall good level  and comfort. Entertainment  at good standard  (& generally I  prefer to sleep).  Staff brilliant always  friendly and discretely  available to serve.  Only hiccup no  early breakfast in  the morning (no  instructions given). Overall , excellent trip , very high  expectations with an  exceptional cabin crew."
9.0,Stay in club. Check-in in CPT quick and efficient.  Very elegant with  the choice of  drink and food  and an excellent selection of South African wines. Boarding was announced in the lounge. Boarding  a bit chaotic. Seated in the  economy class section  in this old 747. Greeted by name and offered a glass of  champagne by a charming member of staff. Departure and arrival on time.  Food and beverages of high quality  as standard. As  this was traveling with my husband the table was  provided so that  they could dine together by using the companion's ottoman.  Not ok-the very  nice screen of the old first  class The bed  well made by  airline staff using an extra mattress.  A good nights  rest in a comfortable bed. Cabin  is excellent always  clean and professional.  Located in a  flight 321. Emergency exit seat with lots of space and comfort. Excellent  cleaning crew delivering  an outstanding service  and hot or  cold breakfast for  my very busy club Europe cabin. Greeted personally by the purser due to my frequent flyer status. Overall impression an excellent trip where a  bit of attention  and every detailed  consideration paid. Indeed  we fly to serve.
10.0,Flight MAN-LHR-YYZ and return. Outward in  luxury economy on  a 777 there was plenty of leg room and  very good entertainment system food was nice and plenty of options for drinks. Cabin crew good. Flew back from YYZ-LHR on  777 I was upgraded from premium economy to club world by the cabin crew which was excellent. Comfortable seat plenty of options for food and drink. Cabin crew attentive helpful and very friendly couldn't have asked  for a better . Everybody seems  too have a  seat at BA I find them reasonable priced and excellent to fly with.
9.0,Flew BA on open-jaw route BRU-LHR-LAX returning one week later SFO-LHR-BRU. BRU-LHR  still on an  expensive newly refurbished plane. I paid for seating selection weeks before. The day before on-line check-in opened I saw that some seats on the front of the plane became available to economy travellers with no surcharge so I took one of them to deplane as  soon as possible (the plane landed  that little bit  out of schedule anyway). LHR-LAX on the A380 was a really nice experience really smooth  landing and incredibly quiet upper-deck cabin. Food was not bad as long as you don't  have anything too fancy in economy. There was only one complete meal after take off and a pre- arrival snack before landing. On an 11 hours flight this may seem not enough but  we are welcome to pick up snacks in the galley during the flight as well as having drinks fixed on demand. Only one negative spot of the flight: the cabin was really cold! SFO-LHR still on the A380 departed a little bit late due to a malfunction of one of the doors but crew kept us informed of the situation.  Again nice experience nice crew and so on. LHR-BRU on an A320 departed late after being stuck on tarmac due to high departure rate at Heathrow. Once again the captain  keep us informed and managed to catch most of the delay before landing in Brussels. Overall really nice experience but I wish they would not charge as much for seating selection before online check in. As I may be a nervous flyer I need a window seat and  may want to  get seating elsewhere. The four legs cost me more than 130 euros on pre-paid seating which I could take into account when choosing between BA and an  international airline that let you choose  FREE of charge when booking your flight. Besides that I won't hesitate  again fly BA in the future.
10.0,Flying LGW-MCO-LGW route  to Business and  was really happy.  Delta check at  checking in at  night then priority  of access. The  accommodation was superb.  As on 777ER  flights were 2J  to 2K which  were fine but  were changed to 11E and 11F  and the return  flight we noticed  that on outward  side were more  expensive Flat beds were great Service  was exceptional. Both  flights left on  schedule and arrived  on time. Delta  check at MCO  were a bit  late but served  the purpose so  cannot complain. Was  wee bit worried  by the service  after some of  my reviews but was pleasantly surprised.  Best done BA.
7.0,Small business class  to board B777. Tired old cabin  with IFE system.  Business class seat  is cramped and  cramped with forward  and rear facing . However cabin  builders deserve praise  on their excellent  service
9.0,"Pisa-LGW. Lounge at Pisa is a shared set up  and rather nice.  Big and colourful.  Good seats. Much  cheaper than hanging  around the terminal.  Could have used  it a few  times Plenty of  drinks Mediocre snacks. No food. Checked  flights online. Baggage  dropped off. No  WiFi Plane was  not on the  landing Had to  walk across in hot sun (which  makes me wish I wasn't going ) This is very annoying -  and the whole  debate over flying  here instead of  the three bright  and blue and  white planes of  an Irish airline's  flag parked next  side - is  - This has  in the past  - did not this time include  any use of  an air-bridge. (More  short cuts I  thought Plane was  very newish A319  - and pushed  out to the  airport - and  very bang on ! All clean , tidy including  2 wash-rooms. Seats  looked old and  dusty - but  all were comfortable  - seats 1 B and 1 . Afternoon tea  arrived on board  ( nothing exceptional  but a lot  we can do  with this sort a meal) -  but as my  friend was driving  - we landed  and happily drank three Gin and  found FA's very  warm and friendly.  She offered me  a 4th G&T  which I declined.  All in all  - good experience.  It could be much better though).  Well ahead of schedule."
10.0,"I flew from  Amsterdam to Istanbul  for BA on their 767 the  seats in Club  Lounge were very  attentive in their  experience From start  to finish of  their flight they  ensured that all  customers in Club  Lounge received the  fastest service. Although  the 767 is  going to show  the age I  prefer this version of the Club  Class seats compared  to the new  one which is  currently rolled out  to their Airbuses.  Not least the  seats on the 767 are comfortable  as there is  lots of space  in the rows compared the the  new version which  has the same  seats as economy.  Their catering was  great with a  great choice of  meals to select , the service was speedy and  friendly too with  complimentary drinks etc.."
10.0,Flight First from  LA to Seattle  Check in at  gate and escorted  through check-in desk  and was checked  out very quickly  and was quick  and then through  our million dollar  check straight into  the Concorde Room.  After lunch in  a lounge and  found our host  was just finishing  her shift as  usual that attentive  room service improved  greatly when other  staff took over  from our starters.  Excellent selection of  food and drinks and a very  quick start to our flight. Boarding  well and both  if us were  assigned to our  seat 2E/F which  had 2 together in the middle  in the cabin.  The crew on  all sides were  amazing and couldn't  talk enough to  make our flight comfortable. Seat very  nice and food  high quality with  the wide selection  on drinks available.  All passed very  well and being  let off plane  again we were first at US  customs although there  were no queues  getting through within  10 minutes and  our bags were  handed off. Excellent .
10.0,Flight BA 677  Amsterdam to London  from Club Europe  Another great flight  with a wonderful  flight in Club Europe excellent service from all members of the crew with updates and a warm welcome  to name from them. The meal  is very good indeed with a  good choice of meals to choose . Throughout the  flight the crew  were very professional  and quick to  clear the meal  ready to clear  out the meal  out too. Although a 767 which  was showing some signs of age I much prefer  the aircraft with  the old style Club Europe seats  compared to the  new Club Europe  which has been  tried out by  Airbus and which  every one likes. A wonderful flight  with great service  what more could I ask from a great crew all that I do ask is  if the 767  to go back to the old  club Europe.
9.0,Flight to JFK  from Heathrow and  JFK Positive experience  While the flight from Manchester to Heathrow was delayed (outside BA control) we were constantly informed about the delays. Attention to  detail was excellent. BA upgraded our  seat at our request promptly and  before any fuss (Silver wedding Anniversary). The flight attendants were excellent and  the food (and drinks) was tasty. Some passengers can  become somewhat critical about BA but we were more  than satisfied with  the service.
7.0,"Flying from Gatwick , Barbados on  Boeing 777. Seating  was good. As  previous reviewers mention  loading screen is  bright with a  large amount of  clutter Overall staff  was good although  a member of  Staff forget to  bring bread rolls  in with the  food until asked.  That same member  or staff also  politely requested drinks.  Overall good boarding procedure and disembarkment  was a pleasant  experience"
9.0,"The short hop  from LCY-ZRH. Nice  looking Embraer which was only about  halfway full on  a Monday afternoon.  Left on time , early decent  light salad meal  with a white  coffee in flight.  Fast and efficient  operation at a very good price."
10.0,First First First  Class Europe. SAT-DFW:  Fast and smooth  flight with friendly  cabin crew no  delays but used  my priority pass  on enter United  Kingdom Plane delayed  by one hour.  Again smooth greeted  with friendly cabin  staff captain apologised for the delay.  Nice hot towels  with champagne and crisps or nuts. Short but nice  flight Landed with  very small delay.  Our First class  accommodation in DFW is very basic  but far from  your gate. Boarding  process was very  pleasant with waiting flight crew greeting  you by name  and guiding to  my seat. Champagne  being offered before  they could take  you in your  seat This first  flight travel was  for a more  than excellent flight.  However this time  it was a technical issue but  the captain informed  you about every  issue excused several  times for the  delay again when  landed in London  had a delay  by more than  1 hour. Cabin  staff gives you the feeling you 're the only  person on board  giving you private  toilet on demand.  First Club Europe.  Nice room with online reserved Cabana  and a tasteful  room Private bathroom  with shower gave me a new  confidence boost. Boarding  experience again excellent  in all ways short flight. Hot  towels decent food  with perfect service  and a perfect  cabin
9.0,"Flight BRU-LHR: Club ! Smooth check-in  and friendly ground , small but clean lounge with a delicious croissant  & coffee greeted  the friendly cabin-crew who gave us  very excellent service  during this small flight starting with  tea towels tasting hot breakfast and  green tea seats  were comfortable but narrow for this short flight. LHR-DFW:  Business class with  quick security process  and room with online reserved Cabana , again an  atmosphere of rest ful comfort. Clean 777-300 greeted by  our flight crew  were excellent. Flight and service couldn't  get better. Food  a good amenity  that contains everything you need on a 10-hours flight slippers and pyjamas were comfortable. Service  is private excellent  and on request  and with a  voice asking if  I was alright.  Flying in first is still on  par the best with a good selection of movies.  * First class customs in Dallas were electronic for ESTA people so 10 minutes after  landing the plane  I was waiting  with my bags  so I could recheck for my  first domestic flight!  greeted by friendly crew when boarding  this plane AA. We were offered  warm towel and  bottle of champagne. Friendly captain told us after leaving  the gate that  it was a  problem and we 'd have to taxi to another  gate for technical support. After 1 pm (captain had  left us informed)  plane took off  we arrived after a short flight  from San Antonio."
10.0,This was the first time I have flown with BA and I have to say I was very impressed. I flew economy from Brisbane to LHR return.  to Singapore on the outgoing trip and Hong Kong on the return leg. The experience was so much better than on previous flights I had taken with competing airlines. The cabin felt spacious  but comfortable even in economy. There  was a good range of inflight entertainment and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The cost of the flight was a little more  steep than other  flights but having been very satisfied with the service it would not  deter me from booking with them again. Would preference them over other airlines now following that trip along with recommending them to others.
2.0,IST-LHR the so  called business class  was a joke and is virtually  absent from economy ; any decent airline seats are crammed together and do not recline  and there is  no sort of  movement whatsoever on  a four hour flight. Having flown on Turkish Royal Jordanian Emirates and  Asia Pacific in  these past couple  or months only  made the contrast more striking. Never .
9.0,"PS I wrote  another positive experience  A few weeks ago - on  the LHR route  in Pisa. I 'm pleased to  say (wait for  it another positive ! This time it was the  Aero Club Europe  - better in my view. As I said before , a shame  you cannot produce  the exceptional rather  than ""Very Good""  when it comes  to the seat.  Economy lounge was okay - not to crowded. Flight  delayed 10 minutes . Very nice meal on board. Really tasty and . Nice smoked  salmon and so aps A few  S and T's  brought it down.  Good FA's. Smooth flight. My only gripe we were  getting off station on the outer airport - like Ryanair. A small hassle with a  line over the tarmac. Bags were not given priority  and was annoying. All in all - a good  flight"
10.0,"My experience LHR  with HKG. Was  little bit apprehensive about their reputation  but found the whole trip excellent.  They were friendly and helpful aircraft , clean and  service gave a wide choice. Drinks offered half an hour into the  plane and meal  service within an  hours Would definitely  stay with BA </s>"
2.0,They flew Premium  first class from  London to London  on a 747 carrier. It was  the waste of  money The plane  is 100 years  old and nothing seemed to work properly. The entertainment  centre remote control  got stuck to its base and it had to be removed with  the sharp instrument. The little screen showed a blurred  image so it was not worth  making movies. The  captain was nowhere  too be seen  and they couldn''t  have called if  they needed something  because the call  button had been  turned on all  other controls. At  some stage I went to the  back and went  into the kitchen.  My crew was  there talking and  joking and one of them was  actually reading the  book Shame on  the BA. Never  mind
10.0,"Flight via Singapore. I hadn't flown BA long-haul for over fifteen years and so given  all of the  recent negative reviews on this site I approached the  airport with trepidation.  However I needn't have worried: everything was tip-top from on-line check-in bag drop lounges boarding  and departure and arrival on both  flights and prompt  to collect. The aircraft both ways : a newish 777-300ER clean and  well maintained and  though the herring-bone  cabin configuration does seem a bit  cramped on both  sides I was  assigned the last row window seat  leaning backwards with an empty seat  closest to me  but I was able to slip  in and out  quietly enough and  never have anyone  notice me. The seat was a  bit narrow for business class. but very comfortable with lots of storage  space and no  shortage of pillows and blankets; the  entertainment was excellent - screen on the small side  with very good  graphics and audio. Food was simple  but very good , fresh well-presented and lots of  flavour Very generous with the booze : excellent champagne  service and some  single malt whiskies , served correctly by the wonderfully  friendly FAs: old  school British middle  age ladies and gentlemen chatty and  friendly to the point of parody , the twinkle in their eyes  telling you that  I know it.  Very excellent experience keep it up !!"
9.0,"Fly with BA462 on a Boeing . Very full  load but it  didnt stop the  BA from delivering  outstanding customer service!  Dinner and sandwich  served 30 minutes  to take off.  Free round of  tea offered. Very  nice crew helpful , friendly. Pilot personally came out  and greet passengers  on our way . Very smooth  lift off. Landing  will be better.  I definitely fly  with British Airways !"
3.0,For my annual trip ATH-PHL via  every European city  and 18/3 return  and this time I chose BA  because they were  also cheapest. This was my first  time on BA  from the USA. Soon after my  trip I tried to select a  ticket as far  out as possible however I was  told to pay 35 euros for  the seat in  row 27. 35  seats and you  were almost at  the end of  the aircraft. In the end BA  is more expensive  that others. The  service was ok  and punctual B777 not really my  style as very  bad staff service  but one hostess  was excellent another was ignorant and  bad Food the  usual Penne Rigate.  Reply to BA  by email however  neither reply was ever received. For  my return flight  BA was in row 30 same  as B777 same  seat Rigate and  of course a  different choice of  live entertainment. Breakfast  the lovely frozen  cinnamon roll. Yes frozen or chilled.  My next choice  should of course not be BA.
9.0,A short haul from Gatwick to  Manchester and I had no expectations. Check in was  quick and we were on a vintage Boeing 737. All in all very happy. They supplied a decent  sized snack. Drinks  service was efficient.  there was no in- flight entertainment available but we should all be able to cope for 2 hours without surely? Comfortable enough friendly service got there on time and good ! All adds up to a happy traveller.
8.0,Fast return. Great  alternative to rail  transport which is  much more expensive.  It was a breeze on both  flights New comfortable A320 cabin old  seats were really  good A choice  for snack and drink were served with options for  dessert Delay arriving into Heathrow as usual the airport  was really over loading and limiting BA as an  airline Annoyed that  they are no  more able to  reserve your seat  by hand-baggage only ?
9.0,"Flight from London  airport to Rome , Flew the same route last  week too and  both times it was excellent. This  year our flight  we operated with an Airbus A320  neo slim line  aircraft that looked brand new. These  were very comfortable for a short  haul flight and  had leg room . In-flight catering  were excellent. Coffee  was a bit  slow but the  sandwiches were delicious.  First time cheese  & ham doorstop  with white bread. I expected good  food after last  time flat bread  and was not . Cabin crew  are very friendly and efficient as  was the airport . Boarding process  is fast and  efficient and on  most flights at arrival and destination  the aircraft was at a jet ty so no need to board  by bus. Flights  booked and arrived  on time. Will definitely fly BA !"
7.0,- Missed out on the A380  on both legs  are in a  while Planes were old but well  kept and clean so no complaints ! Outward leg  experience excellent with  great food and  great cabin service.  During the return  trip the lady in front fully reclined her seat  shortly after take off and went to sleep leaving  us with just about the same  head space as  we have in Economy. Even during  full service cabin crew did nothing to alleviate the situation. Very disappointed  with this aspect and also with  the breakfast. How  few people on this site have  said that they  would not want a hard croissant and sweet cereal bar for breakfast.  Who are you ?
9.0,Heathrow to Bilbao. This is one of BA's new routes (although they used to fly the route years ago on a B757) and we got our return flights for a bargain Â£74. BA's hand luggage only fares to Europe offer very good value and I wonder when they will consider this pricing tier for long haul routes! The A319 flight left from Heathrow Terminal 1 which is closing in June but now looks and feels like a ghost town. There were 3 shops open on the day of our departure and most of it is boarded up. As for the flight we had the usual BA chaotic boarding process but overall an excellent flight even if the  cramped seats are uncomfortable and certainly  comparable to Ryanair with hardly any space. I appreciate BA's offering of sandwiches on their short haul flights  I do wonder  if passengers really need this service nowadays.
10.0,The Europe LHR-AMS. The boarding process was a joke we had to  take the bus  onto our aircraft. In the boarding lounge they asked  of all Club Europe and Gold  & Silver to  come forward and  use the bus  but they let all of the  other passengers board the bus which made priority boarding  another total joke.  We should follow  the same process  when flights land  on a remote  location and have  a separate bus just for use by Club Europe passengers at least  where departing Club  Europe passengers would  get their priority boarding. I understand  there is a need for on board departures but  airlines really need  to ensure that where priority boarding  is taking place  every Club Passenger  sees it.
7.0,BA 1321 Newcastle  from Heathrow 1/4/15.  Checking in at  departure was as  usual very fast  & efficient. Once on board the  BA crew did a great job of welcoming everyone.  Very great crew  and old school BA charm at  its best and  no small achievement  given the very  short departure time.  Excellent and very  spacious seating which  seems to be the new norm  on economy class  passengers on short haul European flights.  We arrived at  JFK not quite  the time as  i remember but hey ho not at all bad.
2.0,Flew Gatwick to Kingston 13/3/15 return  to big disappointment  had to climb  on strangers legs  to leave seats. Not all options  with food available if your at  tail end of the meal run.  had to pay  and sit together  Apart from my husband who was  chatting to a  young bloke who was happy to  wait so we  can sit together BA did not even try to  pay us. Not  even the money  is far superior from their lounge to the flight. Will never travel  a long haul again be warned don't waste your  seat
3.0,"from Heathrow to  Newcastle 22/4/15. Checked  on at T5  by an agent  who should train  some of the  crew Very welcoming . struck up  a conversation with  BA this person  was a credit  to the company  but a much  better one. The  pleasant experience ended  when Punctuality reared  her ugly head  Once more. I've  heard this repeatedly.  Passenger was delayed  30 minutes. Not  the end of  the world but  the inconvenience which  occurs so regularly  I can pretty  easily count on . It's a  pity BA can't  fix these issues  and get flights  up to schedule  a majority of  the time as  other airlines are  currently able to.  The on board  service is like  another tale of  two airlines. Some  people are excellent , just lack  quality and behave  quite strangely at  all Possibly this  could stem from the two tier  and mixed fleet ? But whatever  that issue may , crew quality  the service is  outstanding When we  arrived at Newcastle  one crew member  reported that the  flight was only  15 minutes behind ! Well marvellous , in my  eyes Having just  been around the  airport on another  airline which was  unable to operate  4 out of  five flights either  behind time or  ahead of schedule  i have to  say that I  was generally unimpressed."
10.0,"King Kong to  Best in World.  This was on  an A380 -  first time aboard , must say I was impressed.  So much better  seats than the Emirates A380. Great , lighting large . Nice to have a number  more small cabins on both decks.  Great service from  my crew."
1.0,"BA 730 LHR-GVA 20 Apr 15. Are fooling no-one with their new Club Europe Business  Economy seats - they look nice , but are too close together  and extremely poor legroom! As a regular London to  Paris traveller I will go back to flying Swiss! The decision to change this is almost as bad as the stupid decision to have seats facing backwards  at Club World where you have to face strangers and climb over others to get to your seat. If you can't fly First Class with BA choose another airline until they remedy these issues because their Business Class product  looks rubbish!"
6.0,"April 3 2015 Sydney-LHR. Staff were  extremely attentive and pleasant throughout both sectors. The cabin  was very new  very clean and  my IFE was fine although not  as good as  if I was  sitting in window  seat facing backwards  and was fine.  The seat while sitting is comfortable , although quite  cramped There is  limited storage and  there can be  tricky getting in  or out of the seat especially  as you are  facing the window.  My problem was when the seat  came in flat-bed . It is  too narrow that  I cannot turn.  The seat buckles  in the middle.  as well the  gentleman next to me would slam his table and  the monitor shut  throughout the flight , because of  its design the seat you feel  the movement. To  feel comfortable I  needed to put  my seat in  sort of a  sleep mode in order to sleep which defeats the  whole purpose of a flat bed. As well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed  if it wasn't  clear BA are  charging a premium  in this seat  because they squeeze  4 across (compared to 4 for .) They are  making a great  price out of  their amount of  leg estate in  the air. It  was time for them to deliver  this update. The only reason I  paid this fare was because of  their great luggage  clearance (which I  had on this occasion - 96 % and the  possibility that I  am flying back  to First for  the additional cost  which I will  write about separately.  And while I  love this airline  dearly it is  good because the service and staff  can compensate. Next  when I fly business it will  be CX again.  That seat is a real let down."
1.0,24 Aug 2014 flight BA0272. Me and my 3 friends flew from SAN to LHR  and to IST. Our check in and baggage processes took almost 2 hours to be  complete I wonder what would happen  had we were not been there 5 hours before our flight. When  someone gave us  our tickets we  learnt that they  seat us all separately. They could nt even manage  and sit us together. When I was thinking how could this get worse we missed  a LHR-IST flight  we waited in  a queue for 3 hours to go to our hotel. While a clerk was trying  the complete our check-in for 2 hours another clerk next to her managed to complete  some of the passengers processes and when we were  off the plane we learnt that  the plane was overbooked and the other cl erk  were offering 800 /- per person  of free accommodation  for volunteer passengers  could fly on the next plane.
8.0,DAY 15 LHR-Sydney (via Singapore). I  fly First as  one of a  ticket for no additional cost with purchase of business seat on SYD-LHR  and I really  liked the Concorde Room at Terminal 5 lovely meal  time service and  large elegant space. In terms of  this flight the FA were very  accommodating and helpful  for all legs. They went out  in their way  to make you  feel special and  welcome guest. Food  was very good as was wine offering. Seat was comfortable and roomy  although there is a lot less storage then in  the Business Seat. In fact while there is a lot of room  some of it  there is not that useful. At  first FA did  this for much of the time  they didn't really come around (except  occasionally to offer water/juice. Whereas on SQ economy FA  would check on you regularly throughout flight. While of  course it is  very special to  fly First next time I would  be just as  happy to fly  on Business which I think is  really great value  the money and  their seats are  equally as or maybe even more . If I 'd paid full fare for this  trip I think I would have been questioning the  Value for money.
7.0,BA662 31st March.  Cyprus 14th April. BA makes us think 'better quality'. However the flight  TO and from Cyprus is now  appalling in terms  of food offered. The duration is over 4 hours and it is not acceptable for  BA to offer 2 cold sandwiches.
4.0,BA0010 World Traveller  16 Apr 2015. Bangkok-Heathrow (London). BA0009 World Traveller 17  Oct 2015 Heathrow (London) - Bangkok. The check in  people were unhelpful and refused to check my luggage through despite it being done on the first leg  on my trip I also met  up on the same flight where this was allowed. The plane was old. The Cabin crew were professional however compared to the middle eastern airlines the service wasnt nearly as good.
4.0,Sat in Club . B777. Fourth  leg haul leg  for BA in  the last month  and this was  so far the  worst flight. That  aside I still  found the product  was disappointing. I'm  in camp that  says the seats  is highly uncomfortable.  They are far  from narrow as an average sized  and still finds  your arms draped across the arm  rests while trying  to sleep. You  just can't keep  your arms by your side. As  is little to  never sleep. IFE  tired and awful.
7.0,"LHR-AMS-LHR in Club Europe on A321. Nice service for a short hop. I think BA's Club Europe product  was better than their long haul product. No flat  service but aircraft were in good  order cabin crews , efficient and  very nice. Food was actually edible  including a cheese and charcuterie plate. Both flights delayed  due to Heathrow  delays and Amsterdam weather but other than that a pretty good experience."
5.0,"LHR-PHL BA067 19th April. One of the features of a British Airways  business flight that  intrigued me in the past was the breadth of special-meal options. This until recently included a ""seafood meal"". Indeed ten years ago BA had fisherman's pie as an option in economy class not just the horrible and relentless chicken-or-pasta - then they boasted of their support for the British fishing industry - no longer. Seafood meals are gone. Why? From a BA response: ""I'd like to inform you that  seafood meals have been removed due to the low  demand with many of our customers now choosing other options"". Indeed. If no seafood meal exists then there is no choice  and are no options. There is only chicken-or-pasta. Really  What would it take to offer a ""cold seafood meal"" a tuna-fish salad and a bread roll? One  more reason to choose BA is gone. One more reason to fly with a Middle Eastern airline such as Etihad who still care about service of a sort that BA has started to abandon."
8.0,"Delta BA1385/175 MAN-JFK.  First flight full  of smooth second  leg on old  & clean 747 , good leg . Wifi and  food good. Was  just thinking as  you were landing  that what a  good flight it  had been when  it was aborted abruptly and we  tried again eventually  the captain said  his two warning  lights had gone  off but the  situation appeared to  have rectified his  captain remained calm  and the plane  had safely me eting several around  me were obviously  feeling anxious."
7.0,Back to Thessaloniki return. Outbound ok  not fantastic but  overall not bad. However where BA  was was on  her return. At  least the clerk was all prepared for my wife  and I even  though we were on separate bookings including ready printed lounge passes with  a guest pass  similar to her own. Maybe a little thing but it made a difference.
5.0,"17 April 2015  - A320 Business Heathrow to Lisbon.  a total waste of money. The food was horrible. A couple of sandwiches and a lousy bread served with jam. There  is no entertainment , and the  biggest difference I  did find from economy was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between  the arm rests. The seat pitch was pathetic and  could not even  offer a rest. I am very  disappointed that I did not choose  economy instead of  Economy"
10.0,"LHR to SYD  on 1/3/15 and  LA to LHR  - 14/3/15. After some poor reviews I was a  little worries as  regards the quality  or whether premium  seat would be worth the extra cost. I have previously travelled down  here with Cathay  and Malaysian and wondered how BA  would measure up. I was pleasantly  impressed Cabin on both planes was clean staff mostly  friendly (Hong Kong leg to Heathrow  passengers were worst  in the 4  legs - ok but didn't seem  too interested in  paying the extra ) As a taller person I appreciated the additional legroom and recline  as when passenger in front reclined it is tricky  to get out ta your seat. I had veggie  sandwiches which were  quite tasty and  as usual served  them to everyone  seated - i  would have to  get staff on the last leg to offer me  free drink when  we served everyone  their meal. Film  selection was excellent , travelling shortly  after Oscar season  when most of the big nominated films were available! I will definitely  look for PE again on long-haul."
2.0,My experience on return BA flights to LHR to  Sri Narita in April 2015 scores very low. I  continue to fly on Virgin Atlantic for the same journey on Business Class for the past 10 years so I have something to compare and the fare is always more or less the same between those 2 airlines. Conclusion  being that you  have far better  quality and service for money for the Business Class on Virgin was  first impression. BA T5 lounge is very photogenic but the reality is quite 'basic' and  minimal decor. Selection  for food and beverages is limited. In the end  we got fed up so I left the lounge to get better food from Wetherspoons! Since I'm small both airlines seats are fine to get a good sleep. On BA you'd still have to pay to select your seat despite paying thousands of pounds! Also  when you are  at the middle aisle on BA you are right next to a  pharmacy which is  why BA gives out Elemis kits. Food: on BA there is a  limited options. For  a dessert you have to choose either 'cake' or 'cheese'. Not both. Also not too different a menu from Economy class. BA's service felt extremely limited they  do know your  name they just do the very minimum service. BA  disappointed me.
7.0,My return flight  via Heathrow to Bologna last week reminded me of how good BA  was for short haul in economy.  Having a two-hour  difference because of  mechanical problems on the outgoing flight did nothing to change that view. The pilot kept us up to  date on what was happening. The crew were charming. OK the snack  and a sandwich  before such flights is pretty basic  but the whole experience is so much more civilized  flying on budget .
6.0,"DEL-LHR BA 256. Seats 17AB downstairs in business class in B747-400 G-BNLY. The aircraft is an old lady now but the  cabin is well maintained. Her age  is most noticeable looking at the in-flight screen. I have become used to the clarity  in modern screens and the faded dim and blurred old fashioned moving map and flight information screens are a relic of a distant past. I have made several long haul flights with BA  747 Business Class recently and have decided that I don't like the  current BA model  business class seat. There is nowhere to put small items like glasses , landing cards and so on. There is a drawer at floor level suitable for shoes and other items you will not want during the flight but to access it  I need an upright seat and have to sit well forward to lean down to it. There is no foot rest  fitted into the seat one you  can adjust to your own preferred level. At the front of the seat pod is a flap then  can be lowered  without getting out of the seat. It is not strong and so  should not be used as a seat and is not an ottoman. Clunky and peculiar to BA it  was not a  great feature that enhances the seat. Individual seats feel narrow and the window seat pod facing aft is accessed through a narrow entrance leading  to a snug and very private space. Thoughts about coffins come to  mind When the passenger in the row behind has their seat flat their feet cross the entrance to yours and have to be stepped  over to exit. Seat 17B was  the poor choice. It is just aft of a set of catering cupboards that are frequently accessed during meal service and a washroom that seems to be  under use almost continuously with queues stretching past the seat after meals and before landing. On the good side the seats are well contoured and comfortably padded."
3.0,"17 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Rome FCO. A total  loss of money.  Only food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could  see from premium coach or regular coach was that  one middle seat was empty and  the portable table was placed between  seat arm rests. As alcoholic beverages  are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was  low and aside  than having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had  was boarding and de-planing first. Don't  waste your money unless someone else  is paying for it."
4.0,"Flying BA256 from  Delhi to Heathrow  - usual BA issues which have  already repeated here  numerous times. Firstly  the First cabin  ( not clean  ( all) with  food on the  table food still  on the seat  and it's pretty  annoying when you  want to spend  30 minutes cleaning  your area when  on board! The  meal - the  food can only be described as truly awful! To  being honest I  cannot be complaining . I received  the standard of  food in economy  but the starter was a watery , leek and  onion soup and  in the main two small lamb  dishes overdone in  size with 6  large potatoes that  cracked when pierced  by a fork.  This did not  come with desert!  Hot tea served  by (probably) the worst patisserie I 've ever had  the displeasure of  visiting - completely  disgusting The cabin  staff were good  and pleasant however  BA was not  offered any bottled water for a  12 hour flight.  it would seem  for me that  they are a  commercial airline trying  and do luxury  without failing horribly.  BA management cannot  be happy with  our current standards  and I am  glad to see  the level of  quality (I take at least 1  first class international  flight every year).  Having flown BA  for 15 years  I now be  on other airlines.  Economy lounge (not  owned by BA  but used by  passengers at Delhi  was very good )"
7.0,9 April 2015 BA 777 Business  - Seattle USA - Heathrow. Check-in easy lounge good boarding pleasant. Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a  seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you  get to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another  ticket to pre-reserve a seat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds !
3.0,We flew for  the very first time on BA  Airways 27/03/15 and  then 06/03/15. Our  flights to St  Andrews from Gatwick  was booked through  BA and we usually fly with  Virgin Atlantic. We  usually upgrade with  BA to Premium  Class as you  have a larger  baggage allowance and  a Premium Economy  service with Virgin  are very good.  However we booked  with World Traveller Plus expecting the  highest degree of  security What a  nightmare I would  not advise wasting your upgrade money. Apart from getting  a larger luggage allowance BA World  Trave Plus is almost exactly the same as World  Class The Service  both ways was  terrible The seats  are old and  uncomfortable and uncomfortable  and were only  given bar service once on a  12 Hour flight!  We had to  buy from plastic  and the staff  was preoccupied with  Economy Class Customers  and had no  respect for our  needs at all.  By the way  out my Husband  or myself were given seats 2  seats apart at  check in without being told. We  only noticed when  I boarded the  flight On this  type of flight I was most  annoyed we were apart as everyone  sitting near me  are single travellers  and Were asleep  at the 9 . The seat  back TVs are  too small and  the TV didn't work properly and  we couldn't even  hear anything. The  cabin was badly  dire need of an interior upgrade.  We will never  go with BA  Travel anywhere and  will not recommend  my experience to  anyone
4.0,No food in  First Class (London  to Mauritius) arbitrary  boarding policy -  because we could  only afford Bus  and on return flight booked Premium  class we told that because we  booked Bus on  flight out we  could get priority  seat on way back. Charging for  Priority selection is  a rip off  getting separated from  your wife on way out!
1.0,When I booked  on BA I  at first did  I realise that  we were putting  us on a  UK Airline but  not under a  different number. Quite  clearly this airline  were at the  forefront of the  UK airlines in  passenger service and  comfort As we  were flying back  to Barcelona to  the UK having  your knees wedged  up against the  seats in front only lasted a  handful of hours.  The food service which you had  only pay for  was indifferent and  quite expensive. If you sat in  the middle of  this plane you  really didn't get  much Probably the  most worrying thing  about the extremely  bad English by  air and flight  attendant was the  airline staff apparent  preference to seats  lining up right for landing preventing  some passengers taking  them over head  upside down while in the air and on landing  jumping up and  down while the aircraft was moving.  The UK bucket  seats are not  too bad.
1.0,BA 208 MIA-LHR  Breakfast Club. Leg  five of a seven leg BA . Another disappointment  that is becoming commonplace. As in  the one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected  right before departure  mysteriously vanished at the gate. In  the end BA  left the seat  of a family to be seated . All well  and good mind you but to  have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats  or give them away is absolutely  unacceptable As such my quiet no  window window seat on the upper deck was quickly  upgraded to a  no traffic aisle  chair on the  upper deck right  above the lavatory  or galley ensuring  little sleep on  this overnight flight.  As a loyal  Boeing Emerald passenger  we can honestly  believe BA really don't care about us in this  in any) regard.  My CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else  seemed to care  any bit. That hasn't happened to  anyone on any  major carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few  weeks on BA.  Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for  your pre-assigned seat as there is  almost no guarantee you will get  everything you pay for. Moral of  this story part 2: fly another carrier if you can as it  would be much worse than BA.
3.0,US Airways could not care less when they knew  our flight from Leeds to Heathrow  had been diverted.  They queued two  days for another flight with two children only to  be told we  had to go  to Heathrow by coach with no toilet. We had nothing to eat  inside the airport  and no one  cared what was  eating We finally  went to Heathrow  and be put  down in a  room and have  a meal so  they could fly  into Miami the  next day. It 's a total  nightmare at Leeds  having lost a  national holiday and with two children there was no  room for them  for all. We  start our homeward  journey on Monday  and hopefully it  will be a  short trip back.
3.0,Flying by Airbus 319 to Lyon and back to Heathrow. The new  cabin is very cramped. By reducing  the legroom in Club Europe and removing one of the toilets at the rear they have crammed in 11 more seats.  Seat 25A and B have no window as they  were placed where the toilet used  to be. They are adjacent to the door of the one remaining toilet. Not very pleasant. Expect long queues to use this one remaining lavatory. They also  seem to have done away with the cooked breakfast on all European flights that start  from 9.30am.
10.0,Return to LAS had a great trip out on  the good food IFE was fine  during the daytime trip wine was flowing. Trip made  infinitely better by  the upgrade to PE on return journey staff found out my partner and I got engaged couldn't have been nicer. Everything  well apart from  our final leg to DUB Gatwick didn't send our bags (even though we had a 6 hour layover) then preceded to keep us hanging in DUB for  almost 5 hours on the promise that they were on the next flight and the next ground staff of Aer Lingus  was great too  great fly all .
7.0,"Posted in Club  - First part is not really a review more  a rant. I  travel a lot  of work and always try to fly BA whenever possible and so  was lucky enough to have a Gold card So for our annual vacation I was looking forward to hopefully getting us  3 (wife plus  2 year old daughter) into the First Class lounge  in LHR as  a nice start to our holidays  and the staff member on the  desk said no. - yes I know you can only normally sign  up 1 guest but for my  usual 50+ flights  each year I never sign in anyone! Still no  he said no. So I asked the guy behind  me if he would mind signing  my wife into the lounge at which pointthe staff  person told him  quite aggressively 'that is not protocol'.  I walked away having been made  to feel like  spoiled kids. Rest  Of the trip  were fine-In fact  i would go  SO far as  saying say the flight was excellent-really friendly cabin crew , made us feel welcome and gave us a  great start to the holidays. Actually  some would say this was BA  on its best (having just seen them at their ) Score given here reflect the  customer service in the air (would give almost full marks if not  mentioning the ground staff behaviour)."
7.0,"Flight MAN-LHR-ATL and back. Boarding at  ATL chaotic with  everyone in a corridor (probably not BA's fault). Delayed departure from LHR on a very  small 777-200. Food , wine good but the Club World cabin is  quite cramped with  too little space to put anything. I don't mind the back and  middle seating (I  can look at my wife!) but  this seat is narrow and not the most comfortable for sleeping. Very good attentive crew. Wide variety of films/music on IFE.  Upon return the  third party Lounge (Club at ATL)  was much better than the Delta  flight Full flight very similar to  Delta but slightly  late arrival at LHR was negated by the domestic  leg being delayed by 90 minutes  closer to runway ."
9.0,"The IST-LHR Boeing  747 Euro Traveller  - Read the  ticket and we pre booked exit  to seats 27A/B  two choices. Leg  was superb I'm  small (6'3"") tall  so could stretch  it out with  the window too.  Was an old  cabin though with  great personal entertainment  and power. Appeared  we have the  best seats which were OK surprisingly  the four hour  flight passed quite quickly. Food was  actually very good  for the crew . Disappointing choice  in alcohol though no JD or Rum. Departed IST about twenty minutes  early but were  only ten minutes  late into LHR.  Better done BA  better than the  flight experience reviewed !"
8.0,LGW-SZG in business  class Not sure  what the point is with the  slightly reduced legroom Club Europe seats.  Had breakfast but  was able to get breakfast in the lounge beforehand ? Only reason for going CE was because only  one more than flexible economy ticket. If there was a big difference  you wouldn't bother. Flight was on .
9.0,"Flying to Bangkok  from London Heathrow  - 13th March.  First time I 've ever flown  to BA normally fly long haul  or Virgin but they don't fly to Bangkok. We were offered upgrades in the last  2 days for  big discount but  cancelled on the  flight out. World traveller plus was very good with  more leg room , comfy seats.  Great food too.  got to sleep 5 hours in quiet cabin. But  if I had paid normal price then it was not worth the extra money as  i found economy  cabin on the flight home were  not comfy and  good leg room. The plane was older 777 but not problem. very  quiet and the  staff were attentive.  One was nervous because of previous  flight but no  time to be as we had a very enjoyable flight."
10.0,"LHR-JFK/IAD-LHR. Superb round  trip (for a very fair price) in economy with BA. Flight out  of an hour  or so late  taking off because  off the weather  but was excellent  as we got  on Fairly creaky , but the IFE was fine  with film selection)  and the free  entertainment flowed throughout.  Great curry on the food front. Return was the real highlight on  a new A380 that had joined  my fleet four  years ago. Large  but even bigger  choice of films/TV , and the  really good free food (shepherd's pie)  and drink (red  wine and beer). Comfy seats with  lots of leg  space (and I'm  over six foot). Service on both flights exemplary and  you have to  admit that I  believe BA have become a really  neat act."
7.0,On 30th March  - LHR-YVR return  for my school  was a rugby  match (27 people). Seats were reasonably  decent and they  replied to my  repeated requests of  BBQ pork well.  Love it. But  our IFE was  simply horrendous and  could not meet  my expectations of  Qatar Airways- outdated  and with TV 's from 3  years before. Since we were flying  on a Boeing  777 there were  2 seats per  row but this  time the cabin  was quite cramped.  My recommendation for  return - put  two seats per  person Even though  they were negatives  from outbound I  want to say the return was  better I had  two seats with  the boy who  had to sit next to someone  so I sat  on the extra  2 seats. IFE  is far better  but due to  opening the window  so I was able to sleep  until around 6  am when I  only awoke by  a breakfast/snack which  was decent. Food  was no flavour  which was quite  dry (Lentil masala)  and still edible.  While my experience  with BA84 was  not enjoyable I  think many of  my companions had to move seats because of the  poor working IFE. One of my coaches had ordered  orange juice so  his cabin crew  brought it to  me as they were serving but  then the other  coaches would take  it away for  whatever reason and  at the end  all said they  were none left.  We had flown  to Cathay Pacific  from Manila the  previous week and  had said that  they had enjoyed  that thoroughly. One  was his worst experiences of air  transport especially due  to him being  overweight and rather  uncomfortable Overall a decent experience but  not met my  expectations To improve  British Airways need  to start to  be able to compete with other  airlines like Singapore 's Etihad Cathay  Pacific and Qantas  but there service and level of comfort has definitely  crossed over from BA.
5.0,"Welcome to Istanbul  flight BA0676 in  business class. I should have guessed what I was going to get when I saw  how service is  provided on a Boeing 767. Business or club class  at a total  waste of money same seat as  premium economy. No  real leg room or width no  great inflight entertainment  and no seat power it's horrendous  you may just as well book euro traveller. Both  planes had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart. Food was only average too in my  case On the plus side of things the plane was for its age (it was the oldest 767  Emirates has got)  in surprisingly good order and the staff were friendly , and the  aircraft arrived only ten minutes late  this is a  plus"
9.0,Welcome to Philadelphia  to return from  a Booked Club World and upgraded  Rooms First with Avios. Great service  as always in  abundance and the  hotel room continues  to excel.
9.0,Air Shanghai to London on 17 Mar. The whole  journey was very good. The check in procedure was  really quick. Boarding  was finished very  well The cabin  crew were helpful and friendly. The  flight was very  pleasant The temperature was very appropriate.  I did enjoy  this flight. Meal  and tasty drinks  were quite good  Quality was not lost. I really  did not expect  it
7.0,London Warsaw to  London Reasonable all round. Fairly nice sandwich and drinks.  Staff were patient  with some passengers  who thought they were in an all inclusive hotel. Very busy flight. New seats are extremely cramped. Feels  every bit Ryanair. Boarding a bit chaotic as didn't  move by seat row. Baggage started coming off one carousel at Heathrow only to inexplicably move to a  new one without  explanation or announcement.
2.0,"I travelled from London to Jo'burg and back on  an Airbus 380 and had mixed experiences. On the  way out I was in Premium Economy and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious seat and window locker and slept well. The return in Business was a different matter. I was truly shocked by how many seats had been crammed in the  extremely narrow seat , lack of  ventilation and having to climb over  my feet to vacate my seat. All this at a premium price.  🙂 The cabin crew were faultless and were only too aware of  their views on the cabin! Never again."
3.0,Return LHR-YVR Boeing 747-400. I had been advised to fly BA but unfortunately I ended up very disappointed with the return leg. My seat was double booked so they eventually got me one  but the entertainment system was not working! When I asked about it she said it had not been  fixed yesterday either. No other vacant seats in economy  and there were  2 in business class but would not upgrade me. 10hr flight with  them Definitely would not fly with them again.
4.0,I usually have  only positive experiences  while flying BA.  Last time travelling  with 30/03/15 LCA-LGW the staff could not have been any less interested in the comfort of the passengers. It was a  4 hour flight  passengers were served the meal within the first 20minutes with nothing to  eat for the  next 4 hours. There was no inflight entertainment. The staff did not  serve any hot drinks and when I walked all the way to  the end of the aircraft to ask about a hot drink was told no one was going round offering tea but if I wanted one I could  ask and get  one from service . The staff  should have looked  no more disinterested  than their passengers!
10.0,"A day trip , March 25  two flights in  a morning flight  in Airbus 319  evening flight back  on a 737-400 J featuring the  most comfortable old . Both flights  later or early.  Nice service for  this short domestic . A breakfast  sandwich and drinks  was served in the morning while  sandwiches or biscuits  or full bar  service were offered  for the evening  flights back. FAs were excellent on  two legs providing  generally good efficient , friendly service on these short flights. Flying with hand baggage only  I used web pages for both  trips which worked . Boarding procedures  were unremarkable which  was good. BAs  Cabin Lounge in  Economy is fairly comfortable and spacious , although very  limited in the  cabin Acceptable cold  beverage choices and  served as the  only hot alternative.  Food choices were  good and of  decent quality. BAs  Cabin Lounge in  Paris was more  crowded but again . Again various  good quality drink  options but just  very limited food  options (basic snacks  like as crisps , hot soup).  Again an excellent  short flight experience . Economy. Would  be more than  willing to do  so again. (Oneworld .)"
10.0,After a trip  with American Airlines  and my flight from London to  Dallas was on !! What a  relief I wish  ALL my AA trips were done  by BA. Great  extra leg space  between gates airplanes.  My 8.5 hr  flight went by . TV in  the seat with plenty of great . Food was good and flight  attendants were helpful  but patient.
6.0,from Heathrow to  my return. This  were a fairly  straightforward trip for  planning purposes. Bought  the PE ticket  but used Avios  to upgrade as  per my usual  I Prefer overnight  stays but these  particular ones were  not To be  frank I only  ever choose Biz  as the space  was flatbed. I do always find  the food to  be good though.  There was a  737 going and  the 777 coming . I find  my BA service  can only be  good and functional.  I was 'missed'  by several things  and gave up  going to find  somewhere for a  pot of tea.  Other airlines give  much better service and provide a  better product but  so long as  I upgrade with  it and I  can get a  decent seat I  will stick with .
8.0,VIE-LHR on March 24 and return LHR-VIE on March 30 both straight forward point to point midday flights both flights in Economy on an Airbus A320 with a mixed fleet crew both legs on-time or early.– An edible sandwich and drinks (full bar) were served on both legs. On the flight to London FAs were not unpleasant but not overly active except for the required meal service and duty free sales. However additional drinks were handed out in the galley if requested. On the flight back a rather young crew was trying harder but was - quite untypically for BA - rather robotic in their actions and announcements. Again additional drinks were served if requested. Both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. I  was really missing the older more comfortable BA seats.  Armed with hand baggage only we used web check-in for the first flight and the check in kiosk for the flight back. Both worked efficiently. Boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE which again was quite busy but not  terrible The Lounge as such is acceptable but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. Food  & drink seem  too be more or less the same in all lounges in VIE including OS flagship lounge. BA’s Galleries  Lounge in LHR  is again a comfortable oasis of rest amid a busy airport. However this time (breakfast time) the food offerings were quite basic and drink wise even basics  such as orange juice or tomato juice were not available. Hopefully just an off day. BA still uses T3 for its flights to VIE which I consider a huge benefit over using T5 which looks nice but tends to be a mess for passengers. Overall a good flight experience although I have had much better crews on BA before. Still consider BA as one of the best options for Economy flights in Europe. (Oneworld Sapphire).
1.0,"Very disappointing experience. Arrived at airport  for a flight to Nice and learnt it was 1.5 hours late - with arriving aircraft nowhere in sight. Prior flight was boarding (also delayed) Having no  bags checked and seats available I thought I might get to Nice  at all in time. No such luck. Whilst the flight continued to  run for another  20 minutes I spent arguing with  airline staff to even check whether they could get me on the flight. First class  flight staff refused to call the gate. All with ""flight is finalized"".  Despite similar situations with other airlines (most notably Lufthansa) they always re-opened the flight and got me on.  My only excuse was ""it's the  holidays (obviously BA).  Staff in addition took calls whilst handling my - urgent - request further delaying the  flight If I have a choice I will definitely  try other airlines. In addition they have changed the seating in Europe to come more in line with Easyjet and Ryanair. At 6""4 very uncomfortable. Doesn't help to upgrade to Business: SAME seat. So you end up paying 300 pounds for a very predictable and unexciting food."
8.0,Flew LHR-IAD-LHR on new A380's in new World Traveller Plus. Overall great service and experience  from hard working  and friendly crews both ways. New  cabin product is great. Seats are  the huge improvement although 6 hours really is the limit on the overnight leg coming  up for comfort. Food was good  including my partners Vegan meal. New IFE excellent and  really like the upgraded noise cancelling . Only 'extra'  I would have liked would have  had the option  for a sparkling  water or even  one as a  daily take off drink. Have had the best and worst of BA  over the years  and this was  definitely BA as it should be.
9.0,LHR-DEL rtn. B747  both ways and  was showing their age. Crew were  used both ways. People may not  appreciate the yin/yang  seating arrangement but  this doesn't bother . The screen  pops up after  departure and you 're in your  personal space. Seat  is still very . Wine list  is good and  even the Rose  is alongside the  Red
7.0,BRU-EWR via LHR  and JFK-BRU via LHR on the  BA All flights more or less on schedule. Terminal 5 in LHR is nice with a lot of sunlight making it very bright and  comfortable looking. Cabin crew on all flights in general professional and giving  really good service. Food and drinks ok. The seats  here however very small and BA really needs to update their seating as soon as possible. The first flight from Brussels to London Heathrow had their updated European cabin which offers better seats but a bit less legroom. Seating on the B747 is very old but still a bit more comfortable then the new B787 Dreamliner where the seats in  Europe are really too small and legroom just ok.
1.0,23/3/2015 LHR-SIN BA011 First. Awful from booking to completion of the flight. As a BA. eworld executive member at time of  purchase some 11  months ago booked this flight on the new A380  Only to be told by BA in May 2014  our equipment had  be changed to  their extremely old 744 due to  mechanical issues. Sold feeling a little let down secured  rows 1a and 2a on the  flights these are  a best of  no bad bunch  and to I wonder why BA  crammed 14 seats into such a  small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front  row of 744s'. At the beginning of March I  posted the booking online only to find that we  have been moved  to row 5 in the middle this was not  right I called  up BA gold line to object only to be  offered numerous contradicting excuses non of  which were valid  once on the flight I found out that the passenger in 1a  were a lifetime gold member so. I can only assume that rank has its privileges. Now onto the  flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. Plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old  passenger along with  the PA being  rude I felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned  I was ignored. I booked this flight for us a part of  a special Far East holiday I had high expectations  for BA First which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money. Will now try to avoid  flying BA in  one of there classes once I  successfully redeemed my  BA balance.
7.0,LHR-PHL return. First  day half full  on both legs  of Club not oversold. Very much better service than when full as crew have time to interact. BA BA should consider cutting back the  amount of seats  to sell a  very premium product like so many others have now chosen to do. Food disappointing as usual - much room for improvement . Decent wines but whites/champagne always  bad on the return as kept unchilled during the turnaround. T5 experience fine both ways  but mid-week and  end of year  being so busy. Lounges good and  most staff friendly both LHR and PHL.
7.0,Today was the  longest flight in . One World  on the world ticket. Buenos Aries . LHR a 13 hour flight.  We really didn't  get any complaints  on this flight or BA but  with the other  3 airlines in  the months it was pretty average.  No FA's were  good the food  was OK the only really bad  part was the  music Half a dozen new releases  and a dozen  and so older ! Likewise the  aircraft selection- pretty  good The 777  is around 6  months old so  it was due  with an upgrade.  Can be fare  wise comparing BA  vs Emirates so  fair contest really!
5.0,"Between Gatwick (LGW)  and Lanzarote (ACE). We haven't flown  together for sometime  and to be  frank we have  no desire to fly with BA  Airways anytime soon. The plane was  a Airbus 320  and was just  not a bus.  Really hard very  uncomfortable seats not even sure you  could recline them. We sat in  Row 11 and  on both outward  / inbound flights  our cabin temperature  got far to  hot and stuffy  as it seemed  to be an issue in just  two rows as  in front and  centre of the  plane was much . We both  came off the return flight with bad headaches. The  flight was simply  awful thank goodness  we ate a  small breakfast before  hand as the minuscule roll and  there was hardly  anything to feed  my child and  whatever that topic  the food was  hardly suitable for  a young toddler and there was  a child option.  Passenger service was ok nothing to  worry about very matter of fact , despite the  rude comments the plane was clean etc. We flew the same route  from October last  time with a  different holiday airline  but that was  all round far  far superior."
5.0,DEL-LHR-HAM in Business.  This club world  airline feels really old now. The seats are narrow and not up to the standards  of a world class airline. It was innovative when it came out  but now feels narrow dated and not a match even to Air India which has  very flat seats on the Dreamliner. The food was OK but nothing special. The service was also ok but lacked touches like smiles hot towels. Amenity kits very cheap. The young Indian crew members on the Delhi route noticeably better than the older London based British crew. The plane was an old and slightly grubby 747. Basically everything was mediocre if adequate. The overall impression was a product past it's prime from  early 1990s. Old  planes old crew old seats old IFE BA are losing ground not just to Emirates but also other European carriers like LH or AF. It feels like the 1970s and 1980s before BA transformed itself.
9.0,Day to trip : Hamburg booked  the day before . Great value  the money. Outbound flight was on  an A320. Great  comfortable cabin comfortable seats - with enough legroom and  all new lighting. On return was  on A320 class  - not refurbished.  Prices will be  available once all  seats refitted.
10.0,I flew today from San Francisco to Heathrow Business Class and as always it's a delight flying with BA. Staff were helpful and polite - in fact they couldn't do  more for me. Seats were comfortable. Entertainment was OK and food was . My only criticism is that on the outbound  leg we were  served lunch immediately on taking off but then had to wait neatly  2 hours for a light snack before landing. As I did not want to 'raid  the larder' and eat fattening foods I was left starving! I still  feel the overall experience with BA  was far superior to any other airline.
10.0,We flew from LHR to Brussels and back on  our reward flight which was very pleasant even though it was a quick hop across the channel! Just about had time  for enjoy the cream tea on the outbound flight. Quality of the tea drink was the best I've tasted in the sky. The champagne  tasted very nice too. Business lounge  at Brussels was very pleasant and is to be recommended.
7.0,GRU-LHR 15 March 2015. Returned to  BA this last 3 flights solely due to Avios  and coupon but  not this tkt. Bossy cabin crew  of the like  from BA as we remember its glory days. G&T always welcome but skimpy and only one and no nibbles! Wine was good this flight. South America routes still dogged with ageing 747 as  compared to Lufthansa's modern or upgraded fleet. Outbound from  Amsterdam my TV didn't work but they did credit  for 3000 avios. Food okay but  fuel for such a long flight poor. KLM and AF do it .
7.0,"Flight A319 out  and A320 in.  Quality time in both directions staff  were professional and polite. Sandwich out , a choice  between snacks (crisps biscuits or chocolate raisins) in as  well as complementary  beverages including alcohol. Smooth through Geneva airport in and  get stuck in  another 40-minute passport  queues at LGW on the way in (not BA's  fault of course)  accompanied by a long walk around  after work for  our airport shuttle to the train station. This was a rare occasion  where BA was cheaper than all  the the competition on the route.  For balance I  still don't think  a BA experience is much better  with the low-cost  alternatives unless you fly to Heathrow . Terminal 5  - much nicer  than Gatwick. Although  most food and drink is free the choice is  quite limited (e.g. no British beer  or option to  grab something substantial  if you're hungry  or the snack  was a bit stingy on the way back). I  expected we might get newspapers but we didn't. On  average it was perfectly fine but I wouldn't pay  anything extra for  it - I'd  much rather have the choice friendliness  or flexibility you get with easyJet."
3.0,"We have been a longstanding BA gold card holder  on frequent business . BA has now replaced all business class seats on short haul flights with seats so cramped that  being 6'4"" I  do not sit  without great discomfort. This shows complete contempt for BA's customers. I first encountered this on a round trip  through Brussels. It will be Eurostar for me in  my future and Air France for  when I also  carry a gold card on other  BA hauls. Is  airline management so confident of its customer base that  it can give  them less space  that Easyjet offers?"
9.0,"Summary - A380 was excellent a  blast of fresh air in comparison  ot the typical  commercial planes of  our Mixed fleet  and very friendly , enthusiastic. Food  quality was excellent  for my first  taste and the  onboard kitchen was  filled with a  range of delicious sweet and savoury  food The upper  cabin was excellent  as it was  relatively quiet and  comfortable with approx  20 seats in  a forward section.  Cabin very good  for a larger  cabin than found on 747/777. Cabin very clean and  in general felt  quite fresh and  spacious The only  problem is still  having to climb  with the passenger seated in the  middle with the  x yang layout."
7.0,"Having heard so many negative reviews of BA I still mustered the courage to book  a trip to Chicago and SFO. To begin with  when I reached Mumbai airport with  our online check  baggage printouts 4 hours before scheduled departure I was pleasantly surprised to see the BA staff ready to check in the baggage. We were  finally checked in  flight to Chicago with a 5 hour halt at LHR. London Heathrow Terminal 5 is chaotic to say  very least the security taking forever  ( our case 45 min) to clear the hand  baggage gave us some 3 hours before we boarded  our Chicago flight which was comfortable. Our next connection  from Chicago to SFO on AA was a bit messy as the  luggage space was full and last minute check-in of hand baggage was  difficult Then for  a SFO-LHR-DEL flight the SFO-LHR got delayed but again check-in was pleasant and though the connection time between two flights was 80 minutes because  of the delay we had a margin of only 35 minutes. When we requested the  baggage purser to let us disembark  like anyone else he said ""why did you take this connection even  if you make it somehow your baggage wont"" - so much for assistance! Even after  the last of all we were  greeted by the  security representative at the gate who took us thru the fast track channel and we made it to  that flight in a record 20 minutes. All went  well except for one tiny hitch one piece of  luggage never made  It to our  connecting flight."
5.0,"Comfortable seats and  lack of space , the food  were poor and  my in-flight entertainment  service was rubbish. The screens were  tiny and the  audio quality terrible.  Nobody liked that  fact that the  BA crew were  all mature people  but the service  is far from  perfect This is  my first time I have flown  on BA for  nearly 15 years . I will  review and avoid  BA in future.  We have had  far better flights  on other airlines."
6.0,"Jet to and from Punta Cana from Gatwick. Two  different flights. Orderly , Great crew. Food mostly quite good although if a salad is going to comprise  very few lettuce  slices and a chopped up tomato  then don't bother.  Staff pretty much  any time. Both  flights busy. Breakfast on arrival in  LA was poor too. IFE is horrendously behind competitors. Really dire. Ran  clear of options after about half an hour. Some  airports offer thousands of films and programmes. The crew are the best part of BA  but the seats  the catering are  right up to ! Check in  was excellent at  the ends. There was a minor  computer glitch at Punta Cana which  caused a short  time but a member off staff came through the queue to keep us all informed. Top notch."
3.0,We travelled CUN-LGW 11 March and it's the last time we will ever travel Business  way with BA.  Limited lounge facilities at Cancun only a voucher offered  towards use in departure area food  service On board usual gymnastics to get in and  Out of seats  and out of  seat choices for  the limited choice  for breakfast tea  available in a  cup without saucer.  BA staff excessively noisy in galley throughout flight. Better  food in cattle !
5.0,due to a  visa issue I  had to fly  first class from  Bangkok to Singapore Singapore to Heathrow Heathrow to Mykonos  Airport then returned  on 6th October.  This was seated in the same  class 16k both  times My main  complaint was that  by the time  people got to me for each  boarding time whatever  we had chosen  off the menu  we had run  short of or  there had been  a mistake and  we didn't have  the meals that were on the  tray Often I  would have to  go out to  someone for a  seat as they  seemed to forget  that there was  a seat. In  late morning because I am diabetic  you had to  speak to the  kitchen and ask  about something to  drink which was  hard as most  passengers where sleeping . I didn't  have to disturb anyone.
8.0,Sent via LHR. Outbound flight YYZ-LHR was delayed by  one hour. Good thing they sent a text message well ahead of time. Boarding was quick and efficient  in flight entertainment (IFE) was superb with plenty of very good choices latest releases. Probably the best I've seen in Economy class. Service was ok normal. B777  was great - I'm 6ft 4in  and I asked  for bulkhead seats. I ordered a special meal and it was ready for all four sections of my journey. LHR-DXB portion all good (B747). On the way back DXB-LHR was great (B777) - I took the 3.20pm outbound flight right after my business was completed (as opposed to taking those 1-2am flights that are offered by other  major carriers). LHR-YYZ flew on the new Dreamliner 787. I was not too impressed with  the seat configuration and space. To me the 777 was more comfortable.  All in all I was pleased  at BA's service and comfort.
6.0,Club Europe from LHR to Frankfurt . Outbound flight was great A320 's new seats  and are very comfortable great food and a good service. Aircraft on the return leg was a very old A319 rather dirty and quite shabby looking inside however purser working Club Europe was  great
4.0,"Travelled back from Cape Town on 28th February 2015.  Check seats beforehand  to make sure , we had  front row seats  only to get  onto the plane  we discover contrary to what the webview had displayed  there were bang s in the middle of a row of seat!  Went to BA and told that the maps you  will see on ba.com are representative of the seats  on board flights and that they cannot guarantee your  flight will be exactly as shown on our website  as the configuration can vary depending  on the aircraft you're travelling on.  Absolutely a total  turn off! The  staff were extremely  noisy our inflight entertainment system keep  working Once the food had been  cleared out and  thrown away the flight attended disappeared completely and absolutely no water or  food were offered  - we were about two hours from landing! BA need to get  its act together and invest in  their aircraft's. Clapped out 747s - even first class looked shoddy!"
2.0,British Airways business  Class is outclassed  our rivals. The  movement out of  my seats needs  attention - I  would not expect  someone to step  over me when I have my seat extended in  order to get  rid of their  own area. The  airline food was  good Drinks were  available occasionally -  several times on a ten hour  journey - slightly  stale coffee -  served out of ice. The idea  is you have  the selection of food to choose  with in the business class galley  seems a joke.  The business class  passenger used business  flight toilet and then helped themselves to the food.  The entertainment very  poor The terrace  food at Gatwick  was outdated -  the hot food  ranging from porridge  I checked in  before 9.00am) a  couple pieces of  french toast plus  your usual cold meats and cheese.  A business class  at British Airways is definitely not  for the money.
2.0,"I have to admit to not being a fan of the BA  First World (Business Class) configuration but this is what our travel agent came up with for our direct flight. Seating you head to toe allows them to get in 8 seats across compared to their competitors normal 7. On my flight 11 rows this gave them 11 extra seats good for  the bean counters but can cause problems for the passengers. On my flight from MLE  TO LGW 10 hrs 35 minutes I was in 11B facing forward and in the bed position my feet were on a drop down stool fixed to the back of 10B. The passenger in 10A facing back had to step over my legs to exit their seat and kicked me a number of times  and they did this during the long flight. It is illegal to drink alcohol in the airport in Male and so after take off I was looking forward to a cold lager. The drinks trolley came but all the beer including the lager was warm. The FA said that they had no means of cooling the lager on board. I cannot drink warm  water and I am not a spirit drinker and so went without. I settled down to watch a film but my entertainment system would work for about 15 minutes and then shut itself down. No entertainment system and I then found that  all of the adjustment buttons on the seat did not appear to be working so it was either sitting up or lying down and risk being kicked. There were 2 meal services on the flight. The  original one was OK but when it came to the second one when they got  into me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer  me was a salad. Not the best flight in the world and when we arrived at LGW all the economy bags came off first and the Club bags with ""priority"" tags attached came off last. I have been in  communication with BA and Customer Relations has stated ""You traveled in the cabin you originally booked. However the meals we serve and our in-flight  entertainment system is complimentary and not included in our fare. The BA  website has a description of this service which includes: 1) Extensive Flight Entertainment System. 2) Seat Converts to 4 key positions. 3) Choice of light meal or four course dining. BA claimed to be ""The Worlds Favorite Airline"". They are not mine. They also clam ""To Fly To Serve"". Well as  to say they did fly me from MLE to LGW bt I am not quite sure where the service came in."
4.0,Flight to Budapest  then back in  business class. First  class not too bad apart from  the narrow seat  it is exactly the same as  first seat but  the spare one  in between. Usually  they are moved  such that they  are wider with  another narrow seat  down the middle. The return was  disappointing BA do  not pay for . Europe travellers  must use Fast Pass at security  was disgraceful especially  when it is  so slow and  noisy The lounge  was mediocre at  all Absolutely not  Worth paying for  it BA need to get a grip on their  poor standards and increased prices.
9.0,Hi I have a house in  London so fly there often. I used to fly  on certain yellow/blue/white  BA carrier from  Manchester but got fed up at being treated like an inconvenience and  that the FA's  and spoke poor ! As a  BA card holder my wife and  i enjoyed a  nice breakfast in  the lounge. It 's not busy.  They were seated in the exit  area which I  checked before we  arrived It was  nicer than the  Air Europe space  they had last  time - which is why I  chose economy as  well to Club  as I feel  still very poor ! The plane  is a nice  new A320 with the new seats.  It was spotless.  I had a  light snack on  the flights +  A few Gin  and Tonics for  dinner ! (the wife was driving  on arrival) The  crew were great.  Helpful and treated  me like customers  and not like  customers Funnily enough both flights pushed  out early and  landed early. Flight  4 was a bit rough due  some high winds  in Pisa -  having a re-assuring  message over the  warning system was a thoughtful touch  for nervous flyers  - my wife included. All in  All BA at  its best. They  keep getting it  well or spectacularly ! There never  seemed to be  anyone in the  I Am flying  in with them ! 4 weeks  flying and look  forward to it.
1.0,Welcome to Bangkok  by Thai Airways  they were lovely to fly with  good choice of  airlines and good  leg room. We  are expecting at  least the same  level of comfort  in service with . The leg rest is terrible  and only an hour after take off the lady in front put  my chair in  to recline and  left the space  on front of me so claustrophobic  I couldn't see  the TV screen  and it was  too close to  my face as  well as having  me sit at an awkward position as I have  short legs and  she put them out in front  of me. So  sad The food  is dire with  only pasta or  grilled fish with  fried rice After a fortnight of  fried rice it  must have been nice to have  something different. Does  anybody actually read  or take notice  about these negative  things are we  wasting our time?
8.0,My partner and I booked a  lovely weekend break  with BA in NYC including flights from Manchester and accommodation - we deliberately selected the  cheapest flight option  for the round trip to save having to change terminals at London Heathrow. When I  signed us in online 24 hours before travel we discovered that our  long haul flights had been changed  with American Airlines (5th to 9th )! This meant we had to change terminals T5 to T3 with very little time following our flight  into Manchester - even with the  BA transfer notes  it was a very close call  - very stressful  and not helped  from the fact that we got held up trying  and leave T5 due to a  broken door! The flight with AA was OK but the food on both the outward  & return legs  was disgusting and  nothing at all  like we expected.  Our BA web  store allowed me to book the  forward transfer but refused to allow me to book the return so I had to  manage that myself! I have rated  our travel experience  at 7 &  10 based on  my American Airlines  connections to and from NYC. The BA flights from  London to Heathrow  were great. We also struggled with  their AA website when trying to check in for  our return flights.
5.0,LGW-TFS-LGW seat pitch  / comfort were good. The snack was perfectly adequate but the bar service was diabolical. My husband asked  after a beer which was bordering on warm. I asked for a  soda and diet coke was advised had run out  on Bacardi (bearing in mind we were one of  the first to be served). I settled for a white wine which was tepid had  to add ice to it. Further into the flight my husband asked  after a second  and he was told that they had to save the beers for the return flight. Our crew were  both slightly older they were obviously  more experienced to the point of doing everything automatically but not actually listening to the  passengers On our return flight we received almost the same service only  missing one can of beer and no Bacardi. Very disappointing we wanted  just relax and  toast our anniversary with an inflight drink. The return crew were slightly more attentive but  some good old  school customer service was missing.
3.0,"Long time in  the leg room  of Europe. Don't  feel no different  than economy both  husband and I  travel with legs  still jammed into seat in front. Save your money  up in the back and spend  the savings on  the better hotel , holiday or  a Good crew  & food though."
8.0,"LHR-SOF-LHR seat 1A on an upgraded A320 in both directions check in  to T5 quick and the galleries  experience was fine as always. Departed  good time a breakfast served by a pretty nice crew not that  any room really  and business class appears to be getting less. Return  checked in quick  and security at Sofia very slow , the lounge is not worth using!! flight delayed around an hour due to weather but once away a decent meal  cooked by yet another nice crew landed around 30 min late on a remote stand but bags on the belt by the time I reached it."
5.0,"This is not  true of BA in general only this particular flight.  We flew LHR-ABV on Saturday 7th . This was the Friday 6th  leg that had to be rescheduled due to technical issues. Now if anyone is familiar  on this route  you will know  the service onboard  is sometimes not  as consistent as say the transatlantic routes. Considering that the flight had been delayed 23 hours one would have though that  the crew would have been more  professional This is not to say  crew were in any way unprofessional they were just  such a hurry  they give you a drink and your meal. There after you barely saw them! Duty Free sped through the cabin faster than Usian Bolt  upon landing and immigration cards were handed out just  before landing. I was part way through completing mine  and I heard the ""Cabin Crew 10 minutes to landing"" announcement! The  row I was sat in had a broken IFE  door hinge and would swing back to the closed position. Fortunately the  seat was not full which is  a first for this route! Sadly  the seat I then chose also had an IFE A too - a minor one but annoying nonetheless.  Fourth time lucky and hussar! I  must add that  our choice of  meals were rather  disappointing too. The food would have been good save  it was on  the main menu.  There was a choice of Chickpea  and Chicken and African Stew. Which  part of Africa  does that stew pertain to be  in lord knows.  But I opted for the chicken. I must say I was supremely  bored It was  just short of a ""school dinner"": flavourless and unappetising."
4.0,London to Budapest  and back in Club class. First  class not too  bad apart from  one narrow seat  which is exactly  a same as  the seat but  they spare one  inch between. Usually  seats are moved  in that they are wider with  another narrow seat in the middle. The return was  that BA do  NOT pay for Cub Europe travellers  can use Fast Pass at security  very disgraceful especially  when it is  really slow and  noisy The lounge  is mediocre at  all Absolutely not  worthwhile paying for  this BA need  really get a  grip on their  own standards and  low prices.
8.0,We flew from  LA to SIN;  The aircraft was a Boeing 747-400  which was tired  & old. The IFE had to be re-booted and  the system was  nothing yet up  the date like  every other BA  aircraft The seating  mats on my  New World seat kept coming off  The aircraft seemed very tired. The  flight again was  on a good  place and the  attendants were helpful.  We always fly  there and I  loved the Boeing  747 but unfortunately  my 747 have to go at some point.
9.0,"LHR-SOF-LHR 27th Feb/2nd Mar Seat A1 on an A320  flying both directions  came in at  the quick used  to BA Galleries  customer lounge which  looked good as ever. Boarding on time as was departure and arrival new business seats  for both aircraft  and were comfortable ; Food (Breakfast) and crew on outbound very good  while waiting once  for immigration in Sofia. Return check  was quick although  baggage check was  very slow the  airport in Sofia is dreadfully dull with no facilities , or drinks  you would be  thinking of using  in general airport . Departure was  about an hour  early as was  normal due to weather at Heathrow;  the crew were  happy as was the lunch served."
4.0,I took a flight from Gatwick to Barcelona. Although it had a BA flight number it was operated by Vueling and that meant I couldn't use the BA lounge despite my silver Executive Club membership. I  had choose Vueling I was under the impression I had chosen BA  I would get the BA perks  all the same. There was no in flight entertainment  (< 1/5 - it should be 0 of course).
2.0,"I travel world-wide , on business  travel in Business  class I don't  think I have  EVER had a  trip with BA  it wasn't without  an issue. Recently  and not for  the first time  I checked in  and find that  Business Class had been over sold.  So lets call  greed what it  is Greed it's  just disgusting practice.  The planes are  so dirty and  when you get  right down to  eat the food  tastes awful while  The Cabin crew  was mostly helpful  & friendly you  can see them  disappear from meal time even when  you use the  order button where  can they go , what and  who are they  doing"
5.0,"European Airways general  aviation services in  First are generally  excellent However the  company refuses to acknowledge that premium ground services should  get added for  flying First class . Ground services  - as special  fees for transfers , are so  often available on  all carriers for  the First class  and are sorely  missed at BA , Lufthansa First  Class terminal and  also at FRA  amongst others). Even  to a Gold  Star Club top  tier member there 's nothing available  – even when  you call and  get assistance on long-haul First flights (ex. LHR to  flights that involve  sleeping in planes  called T3 and  boarding at LHR.  Airlines needs to  step up and  enhance the overall  first product. The  upgrades to the  First cabin are  very marginal. Packing  only narrow (even  for new A380s)  seats in First  cabin the airline  is a huge  advantage to other  budget carriers who  provide a true  first product (ex.  Delta has 8  extra suites in . Wake up  passengers - your  regular fare paying customers are irate  at this lack  in First product  - including full  service support (especially  on special request)  when paying First )."
9.0,Paris - Mexico  - Cancun - Gatwick in economy.  Really fine food ok spacious seats  with crew and  comfortable landing. I  would fly again with BA.
7.0,"Just flew with  BA on 6th  October to Goa  and had three flights in all starting at Manchester. On our outbound  flights we were  upgraded to Premium  Economy which was  a Very comfortable  but was much  appreciated On our  journey back we were in economy.  For a family  with 4 we were split only  by an aisle  so it is much nicer to  all sit together.  Our youngest was  really sick I  believe as a result of turbulence as well as  sensory deprivation. Bless  that steward who cleaned it up. However we were  there for 10  minutes with the  same effects! Nothing anyone could have  done however. Staff  are very friendly  and nothing seems  will be any trouble. Would certainly  book again with  them but this  this time the prices have rocketed.  Not as much room in the  seats and when seats are reclined there's little room.  One passenger in  me kept putting  their hands over the back of  my head rest , then covered  the TV screen - I had  them keep moving  it off. Just one bit of  tip for the stewards - make  note during meal  times you are vigilant in ensuring  the passengers put  the seats up!"
10.0,"Flew LHR-JFK-LHR in  London and enjoyed  excellent service on  both sectors. I  have AVIOS points for these flights and had booked in World Traveller *. From the moment I boarded  the LHR terminal , I was  called by name throughout the flight. (I have a BA Executive Club  Member Card.) The  BA crew couldn't  of been more  friendly yet discreet. Offered a glass  of champagne extra wine and post  flight drinks. I  were given a very warm welcome.  For the return  from JFK I was surprised and  pleased to have  been given an upgrade to Club World in spite of travelling on  my Reward Flight. This meant I was able to  enjoy the pre-flight supper in the JFK lounge which is so much  easier than eating during the flight so I was  able to maximise  this I couldn't  of been more pleased with the  hospitality I received  across both legs. When BA gets it right it is in a class of its  own friendly personal yet very unobtrusive service."
8.0,Recently flew to EZE and back from LHR. Longest  flight on the BA network. In  every direction the  flights were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. IFE rather dated and choices were only average. Food was ok better  that last year on this route. Actually had a very tasty steak  courtesy of EZE  it was pink great! But full English breakfast is best avoided the continental choice was excellent. On schedule  each ways and landed 30 minutes early both ways. Baggage arrived very  fast For once there were no long queues at  BA (Buenos Aires). I fly this route perhaps twice a year 3 years ago it 's all pretty diabolical but despite cutbacks crew all seem much more friendly and the food is slowly improving. No other  direct flights from LHR.
1.0,Not in Club World. My disappointment  lies with BA on the A380  Clubs World seat.  Its theory being the flagship plane  - it should have the flagship Business class seat. As a regular  customer with BA I know the  BA product well  and this seat is a lot more cramped than  their older 777 product. What BA  do when they downsize a product is insulting the regular traveller whom  they notice and take offence and  share with someone else. Its a bit like the BA First product this used to have caviar on  the JFK route  and silver plated cutlery and Krug champagne. Now they don't. I notice  - I used to experience it.  The prices have  shot up - and quality has  slid downwards. Very disappointing.
1.0,Flight was cancelled with no explanation. No offer of help whilst having to stay the 2 extra days in Thailand. My flight from Bangkok to Heathrow was horrendous. Travelled World Traveller plus which is a total waste of money. We were served a meal within  those first couple of hours of the 12 hour 35 minute flight. I was offered beef or Fish.  Fish was actually  vegetarian Apart from  the tub of Ice Cream the next meal was not for another 8/9 hours. When the meal did arrive it was Pasta or Chicken. I asked for chicken. It was . It was also vile. Sent it back. Judging back the food going up and down the aisle  as did several others. I went to the back of the cabin for a cup if tea. I was advised if  they wanted more tea could I retain the paper cup as they  are running out!!!  it was like being on some 3rd World airline. This is BA. Supposedly the flagship airline of our country. It's an absolute disgrace. I have flown for over 40 years and never again  fly BA.
2.0,Flew from SFO  into Milan via  London on 2/14  and 2/21. Outbound  was rescheduled due  some changes requested  for my company's business partner in  Italy This was  the third reschedule and BA charged  us 533.90 and  more successively on  the basic $1822.00  per flight. No  European airline does  so in my experience. Incredibly my travel agency could not reserve me  the window seat  because of time  out unless I  requested an extra  seat for each  leg I did so but was  assigned an aisle  chair on the  first flight anyway. Both overseas legs were on 747s that were extremely cramped for someone over 6 ft. tall. On the  plane out my antiquated in-flight display  did not work.  On the way  home my headphone jack was broken.  I left Heathrow  30 minutes late  due to a  computer glitch but for the next  four hours the BA website indicated  on time arrival  and my wife waited two hours extra at SFO. Overall a very  unpleasant experience. I will avoid BA  if possible.
4.0,"The return flight from Cape Town  to Heathrow BA0042 , was a  terrible experience. My entertainment system was not available for three hours despite being told that it could easily  have re-set. (No  one was available to do it).  Once it did become available it was lights-out time and my seat  would not recline.  It was not  possible to focus  at the screen with the reclined seat in front at such close . Two stewardesses  explained the seat  belt was preventing  a seat from reclining but when  that was not the reason no  anyone else came to investigate. No one seemed to  care that I needed to stand for long periods  or relieve my  stress Being polite  and patient did me no good. I have several questions. How often are the seats  replaced Why is  the entertainment system  being unreliable? How  regularly are the  lap belts checked because mine kept slipping? Customer Services want me to chose BA in  near future but as they ignored addressing these issues when I wrote  about them I  have too many doubts."
3.0,Flying BA2043 Gatwick to Male in World Traveller Plus. Plane a Boeing 777 which was very old and thus the entertainment screen was small. The main dissatisfaction  was the food - going out  it was the  cheapest that we had ever had in long haul and coming back it was not much better. The choices ran out when the cabin crew got to me (comment someone has to be last and unfortunately it is you sir). I finally got my choice  and the Captain gave up his first choice! Other airlines particularly middle east and far east based do a much better job.
7.0,"Flying from St Vincent late on LIAT Airways we landed in Barbados  about 1750 for  the 1755 flight  from Gatwick. The  Delta and Virgin  flights to Gatwick  was still on  BA Tarmac. All  the passengers were  immediately met by  a representative and  passed through to  our flight. BA  staff had to  pay for themselves , therefore missed  the flight. That  means pleading for a seat on  at 21.10 hrs ! Not good  passenger relations. I  would add the  reception at check in was brilliant though."
2.0,LGW-AMS on Friday 13th. Flight delayed  at almost an hour despite being informed in the lounge that everything was on time  as provided by Captain was late inbound aircraft. (this  is my third  long running BA flight in as many weeks). No  response other than the rather matter of fact explanation from the flight  attendants surly cabin crew who clearly wanted to be somewhere else other  then looking after  my guests on . I have  four more flights  over the coming month with BA  and regretting having  continued with this  until now.
1.0,Beyond Appalling. Flight delayed by ten minutes departing Rome to LHR. As  the result one  man decided he was going to miss his connection  from LHR. He  not allowed disembark ation leading to a delay in  arrival from Rome of over 1 hour 30 minutes. Consequent late arrival to LHR. Missed connecting flight. Abandoned in Heathrow at 10.30 on a Sunday night had  to book new flights miss a  train work find  another hotel for the night. Ground staff of no use whatsoever. Staff totally unhelpful. Taking things to a  ridiculous conclusion what  happened to stop more passengers disembarking before departure thus  delaying the flight ad infinitum. Correspondence/ contact with BA  has been a joke since.
2.0,"I have always  liked BA and  have recently been upgraded to bronze . I would 've thought had  a few perks? Wrong! My 15 year old son and I travelled  from LHR-NYC on  Sunday but it  is a code-share  from American Airlines.  We couldn't check  in online so  just stood in  a long queue  I couldn't book an aisle seat either. BA at  JFK airport apparently  could help because  I was a  mistake even though I had bought  a BA! The  aircraft was on  board and seats a reasonable size.  Flying back we  flew from Washington 's airport -  There was a snow storm and  it was freezing. The plane which  had an Airbus  321 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing  an ""on time""  was until 6.15 am on the 21st Feb. Then BA Announced a  45 min delay which sounded reasonable  until the weather  conditions and all  their other planes were delayed or  delayed We were  just boarded on the plane when  BA announced the  plane was too  heavy to be  taken out and  it was too much snow behind  the plane so  he called the  snow ploughs! We sat on the  airplane for 6  mins with no  snacks or refreshments  or water! There was nowhere for  a go apparently  so we couldn't  get off the  plane It doesn't  take a rocket scientist to work out that with  half the snow and a huge  wind that there  will be large  delays The final  decision was after  3 hrs and  the third attempt to move the  planes was that  it had to sit for another  20 mins defrosting  its wings! British  Airways were not prepared to cancel  or reschedule the  plane but instead  made us sit  as cattle on  an airplane. It's  a disgrace and we they will  just put it  up to bad weather and not  just bad planning  and bad management  at their part!  Need to look  at a new  company to fly with."
5.0,"I fly BA business regularly between Delhi and London.  I was surprised  by how dirty the plane was , on 2 of my last three flights my  seat was sticky and the area  underneath me stained. The food quality is generally pretty poor - especially  on the Delhi  - London leg. Also why not get some decent  magazines - Country , Decanter the Economist rather than  some dull inflight magazine and a grubby copy of  Economist I residually like BA but they have to up their game."
4.0,"LHR-JFK. End of a One-World RTW trip. What a disappointment. After a mind-numbing trip through Flight Connections (BA to BA) and a 15 minute walk to the last gate on  our B concourse only to get on a 12-15 minute bus ride i was escorted  into the F/C cabin which reminded  of more of a rabbit warren than an airplane. The aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my  sleeping bag in the overhead over  my seat. Very claustrophobic. Seat was strange. Very narrow and difficult to sleep in - at least 6-7"" narrower than the seats on CX or AA. Strange recline mechanism - normally you can adjust the recline and the foot rest separately but not in here.  This seat reclines  on one motion so you can't  ' tune"" it like with other  seats Menu looked fantastic - apps were good salad was nothing special and the main course (Indian style Lamb) was virtually inedible. Cheeses were good desserts and  salad OK. EVOD was not to the standards of  my competition. Fewer  music and TV selections than either AA or CX. Crew was fine. Stick with AA/CX from now on."
10.0,My wife and  me travelled with our daughter and  their 20 month old baby to  Australia We travelled in First Class.  I did the  round trip last  year but without  our daughter and  infant son. Naturally  we were a  wee bit nervous about travelling with  a baby but  our staff were  extremely accommodating helpful  & friendly that we had nothing to worry about.  The staff on both legs were superb in every respect. The food  was excellent and  both First class  seat pods were excellent in every  respect Comfortable clean  seats well appointed.  we will travel  again British Airways  every time we  are not fault ed in any  respect Just one minor thing that is no fault  of British Airways.  As they call  the flight there 's a dedicated  departure row for  Economy Class passengers  and it seemed that everyone was able to use  this lane which  meant that we  had to join  that queue rather  than just walk  straight through. I  realise that this  was rather pathetic but surely if  someone is prepared  the pay the  entire fare one should be entitled  of some form  special privileges. We 've travelled with British Airways on many occasions and  every time we  have had the  same wonderful experiences.
9.0,In F class  of the A380 . IAD lounge  was charming great  staff nice Concorde  Room room with  excellent service nice food and on  my visit an  amazing soup. Greeting  was very nice  friendly bartenders that  knows how to  handle their job.  Only the slightest downfall was in  a Club Class  part of the lounge the finger  sandwiches were dry  as sand and  never as flavorful.  Cabin Manager Captain and Inflight Crew were was kind  and generous with  their time. Food  is decent Champagne  and great! IFS  was strange and  was easy to  navigate but got  help from FA's  on both flights.  Experience at T5 was shocking. Like  ever heard of  a bovine charging  for the exits.  People like sardines  or small trains  with nothing to  hold onto everyone  had to tumble.  Getting through fast  security however was  no breeze. Return. F check in  counter at the  far end of  a terminal agent  behind the counter  with the personality of wall paper . Concorde Room  service were delightful breakfast was nice  but was ok.  Return to gate  is nearly the  time it was on arrival. Boarding  the First was  another snap FA's  high notch food  flight Arrival into  gate was as  smooth as surgery  and long walks  with machines little help. Overall after  reading so much  negativity about BA I was at  least made to  be special at  the stop except  check in at  JFK
1.0,"After a recent  flight from Johannesburg  to London I was shocked to  discover such cramped seating conditions in the World Traveller economy class section.  Had not been able to secure  my aisle seat (which would have  made minimal difference ) I was  only a middle  class of 3. Like many other  people (and some women) I am  only 6 ft.  have long legs  and the acute  pain I experienced  would manifest from  my start of  my flight to  an end about  2 hours. It  became difficult to  stretch my legs , at times I had to stand in my  seats to alleviate leg cramp. It  had caused me considerable back pain.  They did offer  to swap seats  with a lady  occupying the adjacent  economy seat but  she was unwilling  to do so that was her ! So it became necessary to disturb her on  several number of  occasions to take  the walk along  the aisles in  attempt to alleviate  my cramps. The  flight staff were  gracious in allowing  me to use  all of their  toilets in order  to stretch my legs but had  to return to  them during a  bout of turbulence.  Being very similar  circumstances it does  makes me wonder  why British Airways  should bother take  a notice or  attempt to treat  their passengers (customers)  in this appalling . About 10 yrs ago I experienced an appalling  journey from Buenos Aires to London . British Airways  apologised for different  reasons and swore  we would never  see them again.  However I felt  I would give  them one more chance. What a  joke The world's  worst airline -  please make me  sick"
2.0,Got to Boston  to what was  often called queen  in the sky  or grandmother of the sky. Went  out on ancient  plane with tiny  computer with badly  lit screen and  lousy selection of  films and music.  Did just OK  with crew very  bad Not worth  the money better  than in economy.
1.0,Our flight was  in Dubai we travelled on the  first outgoing and  one incoming to . We travelled  on economy the  seats were cramped and hard. It  got freezing cold  and cold in  Dubai passengers wore  shorts with a  scarf on them  very well. The  food was awful  without choice whatsoever.  I asked for  a coffee because I was so  thirsty but had to wait an  eternity and then  forgot to ask  more before I received it. The  Flight attendants on both flights did  not look smart appeared to want  them perform there  job as quickly  and possible without  a care for  the passengers wishes  such that they  can stand and chat at back  the flight and catch up with each other. We  had had better flights on easyjet.
9.0,"Heathrow to Washington , upper deck club world return. Crew fantastic aircraft  spacious seats comfy food excellent both ways. Cannot pick  sides with anything  apart from they  advertise 50K as being a window seat when in fact you actually cannot see out  of a window from this seat. I think it's time BA invested  some money on  the Gatwick club world cabins. The Heathrow product is  ten times better but the price difference does not reflect the difference  in standard of  living and product .."
3.0,In return. The  first flight was . Nothing special  like always. The  seats are the  best fitted seats  for European flight.  The meal was  ok compared to  the The return  staff was really  bad One of  the FA was rude. He looked  old and tired  as it was  the last flight  for the day.  Also showed no  remorse in collecting  their used cups.  We know it 's a short  time but it  is just unacceptable.  It just a  shame to see  that a great airline is declining  like that.
10.0,Recently travelled to  London return in  London from LGW  with flights on time and very  comfortably on board the B737-436 (G-DOCW/G-DOCX).  We provide a nice complimentary breakfast  onboard BA2736 and  tea and snack on the return  so no hesitation  to recommend.
3.0,Flight 0058 Cape  Coast to London Heathrow Seats 03A  to 04A. Check  in - Directed  to Club World check in. One of our bags  is labelled with First Priority label.  A little annoying  - on the way out all  the luggage was  placed very last  through the carousel.  Next was via  gate 2 and then through World 's Plus section.  Less annoying as  it happened with boarding and disembarking  on the way . Electrical problems  with entertainment and lighting - resolved after two hours.  Only First amenity  item on board.  The sleep suit  available as not  on board either.  Cards for buddy dining kept collapsing.  Apparently it was  a 1st of the month new  drink list available.  With one glass  at Mersault there was no more  on board. Offered  glass of last  resort whites as  the alternative. Butter at breakfast was  free Needn't have  worried about the  bag without the  priority label. It came of before  any other bags!  Our First luggage  went through long after most of the other classes  on travel had  received the baggage  - We did  go through door  3 however. Crew  friendly and apologetic.  Why do we pay the extra? It's back to  Club World for us. Time to  consider trying other  options as well.
6.0,"Flew from LAX-LHR on BA's new  777 The crew  was rightfully proud of their new aircraft and could not stop telling the passengers about its status. My seat was picked as 53K Upper Deck. I couldn't believe how cramped it was for this long journey. The divider partition was covered in red wine stains from a previous trip and staff seemed nonchalant about cleanliness. The available width of BA's offering is a big disappointment. Whilst those socially awkward individuals might enjoy the clandestine surroundings I for one  do not favour the casket-feel of Club World. The A380 and 787 were a chance to hone the business class offering after much criticism. Execution of the flight was prompt and we pushed back on schedule. I fly a lot for work and am privileged to enjoy the premium cabins but  the attention to detail and very slow service don't inspire a return to a specific carrier. One alcoholic drink was offered just after take off and then the all too familiar menu was wheeled out. BA's menu for this flight was identical to a return LHR-MIA-LHR leg I took back in early December. Lacklustre  drinks and the infamous warm chicken  and salad. Maybe I was tired  or didn't endear myself but it needs to be better. I recently flew the A380  in AF to LAX in Business  class that was a role reversal! No limp and greasy bacon sandwich on AF either. LAX Teminal B a massive improvement over the years. From fast immigration to pleasant design , the leader in aspiring all US airports to improve their standards and get rid of carpet underfoot! Although and in summary is this solely enough in a demanding arena where those availing themselves of premium cabin experiences have quite the opposite."
1.0,"I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. I just came back from a  round trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat  for Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and  walked away. I was hounded for  not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes  before plane had  not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight.  But the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are  doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. The  seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. There are plenty of other first class carriers out there that  I will now  become a customer of."
4.0,Flew AMS-LHR-JFK return  28 Dec - 31st Dec. AMS-LHR-AMS on A321 the first thing you notice is the cabin interior. Although clearly an older bird the new interior has a very comfortable and warm feel to it - yet also modern. Nice and comfy leather seats leg room just sufficient for flight under say  2 hours. Service is as expected a quick drink and some nuts (though a sandwich  might be nice  after a mid-morning flight). They are clearly matching their product with the competition on this route as free newspapers where available upon boarding contrary to the intercontinental stretch. LHR-JFK-LHR on B744 totally different experience. Transferring through T5 at LHR easy enough although  we got the feeling they like  to control the  traffic flow to the max - but hey this is the UK after all. Also BA advertise T5 as like it's one building - not the case. All this was acceptable until we found out we  were being directed to a bus gate. They actually board a fully booked B744 through busses with one stairway and door available for the entire plane. Given  as the 788's completely cold and dark occupying the airbridges I felt  this was totally unnecessary. Turned out to be a very dated 744 with mostly Club World and First  class as the economy plus and  that consisted of only 2 cabin  with together rest of the plane premium product. How  they lose your premium clientele at warp speed. Prime example! Service on board was nice enough food pretty ok and plenty of drinks to  choose from. Seats dated and sometimes broken - my adjustable headrest would adjust only to slide back down slowly same problem on both sectors. IFE well just bring your own . So dated it's just not worth switching on. The cabin crew made the difference though on all sectors they were  super friendly yet professional and very helpful. Arriving early morning from JFK of course we parked at a hard stand. Waited our turn for 20+ minutes in a non ventilated cabin to get in the bus  - only one exit in use. BA this is not acceptable. Disembarking  on commuter plane up to 100 pax with buses well ok. But a fully loaded 744? Come on.
6.0,"Out from LHR  for JNB on  28 Jan flight  and check in  but as we  had e-tickets had nothing but passports  to destination never  been a problem before but was  more like a quiz at a  school Also advised  that we would  need to pick  off our luggage at JNB and  checked in again  to JNB for  departure so we  spend time looking for luggage which  was being transferred.  I have never liked the premium  economy seats on  Emirates but connections  at JNB made  them necessary to  use BA. Seats  with plenty of  leg room and general space is  great but are  trying to hard after a couple  more hours my backside begins to  hurt Crew were . As far  the airline food , it was . Return on  arrival on 29th , same problems  in seats also  seat nearest to our seats was  out of order  and without treading on people you  had to walk  towards the end  to the aircraft  as an alternative  is when sitting  for premium economy  there is not  possible to see  the lights as  we are behind  you When possible will always try  or use Virgin  Atlantic"
10.0,"Service from LHR  - CAI new  7 day business  trip - was  absolutely superb. Cabin  attendants were attentive  very helpful flight  attendant on time , spotless food  & seats comfortable. My return flight  was again good  cabin attendants food  and fine seats  comfortable and clean.  even though the  landing was at  a time very  strong winds were  strong in UK the landing was  beautifully executed and  for me as  one nervous flyer really I could not have asked  or two better  tickets I obtained  at excellent prices  on both flight  times relatively last  minute too! No  point in flying  anywhere at anytime."
10.0,Best Economy. Both  meals on lower deck of the A380 professional yet  excellent service plenty  and drink runs between meal services.  Passenger comfort superior  over LH and AF380s. Travelled with an elderly passenger attentive gate staff allowed us to pre-board on both flights. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule. So far best transatlantic experience on an A380.
7.0,Flying to Singapore  in late Jan/early  February 2015. The economy seats were relatively comfortable but  could be a bit softer. The  second leg (BA16)  was quite good except for the meal which was barely edible. The  plane back had a much improved meal but the  PA system had  several issues and  had to be  on about 4  hours Another problem with the return  flight (BA15) is that if you get on the  plane in Singapore and not in  London by the time online check-in  doors open for  passengers there are  almost no seats  too choose from.  They wanted a window seat and  was not a  seat window to  choose from at  the moment the  internet check-in opened  for me. Service  of both flights  was good. I  started feeling a  bit dehydrated and  stopped for plenty  to water on  our return flight  and had no problems at all.  All the staff  were nice and  helpful
4.0,"- The trip got off to a good start as the North  Shore was not to busy and  it made the whole experience relaxing  more than an  endurance test -  but it is  when it is busy. Had a nice early light  dinner The aircraft was a new A321. I like this plane. It  is rammed end  on end. The plane had the new Club Europe  logo and it  struck me how  stupid BA seem  to be in missing the opportunity to develop a  plane that could be really high in quality - but isn't. Unless you are seated in row ""1""  then the leg  space is appalling and the same as economy. As  for the old  wide seat - the centre seat between 3 seats  - is a . Quite why this is logical  escapes me - because it seems  would imply that  because it suits  you they will  in a whim seat three passengers  and not two. This was a  perfect opportunity to stand out from  some competition and  also establish a  non - wide C.E. seat. At  they same time justify the higher pricing. Its no  surprise BA have very few - if any -  European Industry awards  to the services they provide. So  - I had  my light lunch and a couple  a Gin and Tonics which was  good The FAs were great. Flight  started a few  mins late but  still whizzed over to Zurich in  20 minutes which was great. The  worlds favourite airline? Try ""The Worlds most frustrating airline!"""
8.0,I flew club world from JHB  to LHR on 21/01 on the  747 The flight  in overall was a good one. Sitting on the  top deck of 747 is definitely a must as  is a fair bit quieter than the main deck. The check in was a breeze  as the staff  on the desk  are very friendly especially considering I was travelling with  loads of luggage bicycle etc. I didn't use the  bathroom as I know the one in JNB is  not very good. The boarding took  right on time and we were  given pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off  went a bit  slow but smooth non the less. The food leaves  A lot to be desired on BA I had  only Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the  food was perfectly chilled and the  salad was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. The seat  in the lounging position is very  nice but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as  me Arrival at T5 was very smooth as I  think the fast track lane from landing to climbing in the taxi was less than 30 min. I would definitely fly  them again but they do need to look into the quality of  food and the seat configurations for future upgrades.
6.0,My wife and I flew business class LHR-HKG 23/1/15 on a 777-200 seats 11 E&F. Check-in was ok once it got started this took several minutes as the woman at the counter was  busy with 2 friends. The lounge was good overall if a bit crowded and over heated. There was  food type offerings  until 6.30pm when hot food was  offered This was  all well cooked and presented the Thai green curry  was excellent so compliments to the chef. Boarding was on time and efficient unlike our previous BA experience at HKG. We found the middle seats on this plane a bit cramped but comfortable for sleeping. The inflight food was very good I had a chicken and rice dish my wife had braised beef which she says was excellent I do think dessert and  drink should be offered. Unlike our last BA flight 5 weeks ago the crew on this flight were excellent friendly and attentive. The IFE  seat is fair but the screen  was square and is small compared to that on  the A380 (and very small compared to CX). Thanks to the FA's we had a very enjoyable trip. We would fly BA again but only if the  airline was very competitive the staffing inconsistencies worry me some what this is really a management issue and should be addressed if it were the BA brand would be more competitive.
1.0,"Flew back from Milan LIN on Jan 4th. Because of ""mist"" (the pilot's actual characterization) most flights that morning had been delayed/canceled in/out of LHR. No delay info given at check-in nor at gate. Upon boarding the captain informed us that because of ""mist"" we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. My connecting flight  for SFO was 2.5 hrs after landing in LHR. Flight attendant assured me most flights  were being delayed therefore mine to SFO most likely too. Upon landing  into LHR a sea of canceled/delayed lost souls. I was immediately told I was forced to miss my connection because my flight to SFO was on time.  We was forced to join the longest line I've ever seen for rebooking. It never moved. We were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs  "" faster"". Crossing the border control took just as long. Upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. I finally managed to join the free wifi and call BA's office to get rebooked online. I was rebooked on a flight from SFO to LHR. The wrong way around. When I pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a ""computer glitch"" and promised to call me back. She finally called me back and got rebooked on AA flights to JFK and to SFO from there. The next morning at the AA check in they could not check me in on the JFK-SFO because of ""issues with the BA ticket"". It took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks  not get it solved. I nearly missed the flight to JFK too. My suitcase was never loaded on that flight and I didn't get it at JFK. It took me 5 days to get my suitcase back. I will never fly British Airways again."
8.0,Flight LHR-MIA in  Frankfurt Seats 13E and 13F on . It was very comfortable for a day flight and after a light meal I managed to get  about 5 hours of sleep. Recline is good and leg room ok for a person of my height 5ft 10in. Food  tasted ok and would have liked to eat my partners sticky toffee pudding because mine went down too well! We were off the plane first at MIA before First and club which was rather nifty. Good experience.
2.0,"First flight from  flight T5 to  International Dulles (IAD)  with Club World. Check in was  easy even if  the layout of  the T5 check-in  desk isn't the most intuitive. Security  was efficient. However the BA lounge  felt overcrowded and  packed with minimal  amenities and only  home comforts. Outbound  service on the  BA Boarding was  slightly chaotic due  to the gate  gate being too  small for such a large passenger  load but the  crew did push  through on-time. The  club World cabin  and the upper  cabin could best  of described as  clean and functional.  It was reasonably  comfortable if not  comfortable but despite  being a relatively  small aircraft it  could feel slightly  uncomfortable already. The  club World seat  placement was forward  looking and on  an aisle was  comfortable enough. The  touch screen was rather small and  our choice of  headphones wasn't terribly  attractive but everything  else from the  tiny USB power  cable was working.  In general layout  in the cabin  is terrible. Not  only do window less and middle  row passengers have  a step over  the legs of  front seat passengers  to get to  and from their  feet but when  no privacy screen  on seats is  missing for take-off , and during  boarding services you  catch yourself staring  a disconcertingly close  window into your  own face. It  makes everything feel  awkward and cheap.  Operations were fine and the crew  was polite and  friendly Overall I'd  rate the outbound  flight as 'Okay'  as a business  class flight. Return  home experience was  far from okay.  My flight departing  DC at 10.20 am was cancelled  two hours prior  to departure due  some mechanical issues.  Note that there  was no Club  World seats on  the earlier flight  north of IAD  at night which  they could just  easily make at  the push and  then would have to fly back  into Economy. When  they asked about  my BA flight  from Baltimore (BWI)  an hour later  and was told , yes there  were Club World  seats available that  night so I  had to be  bumped onto that  flight instead. Arriving  to BWI check-in , was informed  but unfortunately there  still weren't any  club World seats  available and I  will have to  fly back in  World Traveller Plus.  My flight from BWI to LHR I was on  was rather old  flight The cabin  layout was dated  looking and cramped  with minimal overhead  luggage storage. World  traveler Plus seats  were cramped and  cramped with tiny  flat screens. In-flight  service was bland.  Cabin crew were  helpful but not  particularly friendly. Flight  arrived and arrived  on time. As  a UK passport  holder Immigration at  customs was quick.  Bag reclaim took  time but bags  landed within five  minutes of reaching <mask> baggage hall."
7.0,Hi club world : The overall product still good  but need some  advice on aircraft and seat desing.  Sometimes the window  it can fell  little bit narrow  but no extra  seat for your  seat On the  one hand good  and fast connection . LHR great  and FA nice  & attentive. IFE  great choice of  a nice food  also great). Will  try them again.
8.0,Flew SYD-SIN-SYD and  all in all can't complain. Service was excellent food excellent large wine choice. Seats weren't  that different to other Business class seats we have experienced although I would suggest that couples don't choose window seats as they need to actually stand up  or walk around to speak to  the partner. Seats in centre are adjoining with a sliding screen between. Qantas first class lounge in Sydney was fantastic with full restaurant service. Singapore lounge very comfortable with plenty of seats. Would definitely fly BA again.
9.0,"The MIA-LHR in First. Seats 5a and 5k. This was my first time in BA first and I was really impressed. From the moment  the boyfriend and I walked up to check in to the moment  he left the plane we were very well looked  after The food was nice and particularly enjoyed the ""buddy dining"". My gooseberry crumble went down well. I  needed around 2 hours sleep as the jet stream and storm that  is hitting the  middle Eastern U.S made our flight very bumpy but  not super fast.  Total time being little over 7 hours 20 mins.  We must mention the cabin crew  members were very helpful and professional. We bought the seats in the  middle and it  paid money well ."
9.0,"LGW-ACF-LGW (Club Europe) On both flights  they had very good cabin staff , the purser was the same on both flights and he was  very efficient and very friendly as were both stewardesses. The food was very good too lovely and hot large portions of chicken/beef tasty liked the choices given so we were  both happy. The new seat configuration  of the Airbus we did not  use we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but I'd not  like to be in the first row right by the door and noticeably colder (stood  up by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more  so it's a very small open space between the  first row of seats the loo and the galley! I'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and I found the loo  because looking around I couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and I don't  think they were all way overweight it is very small and slanting roof. A tall and big built person would not be happy! I gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul . The seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor  people behind you wouldn't have had any space and I kept sliding forward on mine. The leg rest has gone too so I had nothing to stop  my moving forward and the space  between rows felt  awful lot reduced."
5.0,"Welcome to Heathrow , 23rd January  2018 Very old  aircraft with old style interior in  BA A real  disappointment after a  couple of long  haul flights in  the new cabin.  It really needs  improvement Anyone who has not flown  for BA before  can leave with  a terrible impression.  New worn cramped  with many falling  apart with outdated  seats Food and  drinks service usual  and standard though. Please BA get  rid of this  old interior once  and for all. It really lets  the airline down  & does nothing  about the passenger .."
5.0,I travelled BA  with Business class  flight to Vegas  before Xmas and  then to LHR  to San Diego  last January. Business class travel is a rare treat  to us and I can't understand  that BA persevere  without this unique  outward facing seating  design To sit  for 11 hours  faced to face with a stranger  sounds awful as is the lack of space created by the curved  seating between the  seat The cabin  conditions were great  but was below  par and the  overhead entertainment system  is poor choice  for terrible picture quality. Outbound we  were upstairs on a 747 there  was two attendants assisting only 16  seats and they  were a good  job and kept  the two toilets . Given these  conditions this flight  really should have  looked fantastic. However  given the negatives  described above I  would classify it  as just about  terrible We returned  in a 777 and my negative  experiences are sadly  these same other  passengers we were  stuck on the  747 for 40  minutes on landing  on buses to  JFK
7.0,Flew Business Class  - Flight crew excellent as always.  Service was pretty decent for airplane  Class Seat was  spacious and certainly  easier than sitting in the back of the plane. However we think this configuration is  a failed experiment by BA. Eight seats across is too many for  Economy Class. The  rows were too  small The backward  facing seats are disconcerting for two reasons: If you  are traveling with a spouse or  children and neither  want to face  you you can't  be together. Secondly  if the divider is down you  are at a  full 15 inches ! Hope BA reverts to the  old style one !
10.0,Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) in Club World. January 2015. Have not flown out of the Tom Bradley International Terminal  at LAX for years but it's now much improved.  Came in and  easily drop a  package as was security and in the oneworld lounge  within minutes. Good choice of food and drinks and  plenty of space. Short-ish walk to the gate good welcome on board and drinks served quickly. Couldn't fault any aspect of the experience and  just took off and landed on  Sunday and managed a good five hours sleep out of the ten hours duration. Love the Arrivals Lounge  at LHR. A  quick shower and 2nd breakfast sets you up for the day.
1.0,"Had a return  journey to Dublin  after Christmas and  finding BA to  prove extremely disappointing. My principal complaint  was the dirt  in the seats ' floor area  looked as if  they had not  properly cleaned for  previous flights. Also  at 5'8"" I 'm not that  tall but still found the seats  uncomfortable and uncomfortable."
9.0,"Sent Business A380  flight and returned on 777 BKK-LHR. Found T5 lounge great as usual  people were fine  and ok in  the cabin. Food  served was tasty  & cabin crew professional but friendly. Wash bag was  fine for Business , hey it's not a deal braker. IFE was ok touchscreen on both flights."
10.0,The First flight to LHR was  excellent with an  excellent Captain and  extremely efficient staff  and a refurbished  Crew Cabin is  also smart. Arrived  at LHR early  which is a  nice change despite  the enforced 'stacking'  it happens to  facilitate landing at . Return flight was great too  Thanks to the  passengers and crew 's service on  a full flight  of the A319  that was the old type and  that did it ! Overall a  positive experience with  the
2.0,My wife and  I flew to  London late November  and had pre booked seats online  ta and fro but on both  occasions the seats  had already occupied  when we boarded  The flight attendants  attitudes towards this  point on the  whole journey was  its best rude unhelpful and indifferent. Asking for a  refund was a  constant siege after  3 hours into  a flight they claim that they  have run out  of galley drink ! On our return trying to  secure a refund  on the pre  booking seats proved  that Overall B.A.  A got to rank as one  if the worst  airlines to travel with staff with generally poor and  mean attitudes penny pinching which is  based on mean and poor legroom.  Hate to say this B.A but  this and other  passengers put our  favourite airline to absolute shame.
8.0,Flew BKK-LHR was fearing the worst  and read the reviews on here  of the aisle  seats where people have to step  over you to get out. Relieved to say this  never cause me any problems and  it wasn't disturbed. Found the seat  would be comfortable in both the  aisle and flat bed positions. Service  in the cabin  itself was adequately good. Food average.  Audio system average.
2.0,"Reviewed on A380.  Business Class Seat . Crew unprofessional  most of the  flight forgot seat  number existed with  no welcome drink  every 15 mins  ( passed no  drink top up until I asked  3 times) forgot wine match with  each course and  then handed out  a ""ok?"" as  no comment. New tasting menu was  not good. Had a flight in  London with CX  a few days later and the  same quality crew , overall service was another league  that far outshone BA. The BA  seat product is  a waste of money and crew  need a re-train."
3.0,London Gatwick to  Southampton 27th December return 7th January. 777 Aircraft economy  Class I never travel economy class so it was  a bit of  an eye opener particularly on a 12 hour flight. The seats are  much too close  up and quite  uncomfortable In the  middle seat the  pull down tray was broken. When  another passenger in front put his seat back I  did use the  toilet and when  I asked the  lady to ask him to put  it forward a bit she just shrugged and said nothing. Poor unfriendly  passengers and absolute  bad food. BA are miles behind the Far and Middle East airlines  and still charging . I have no idea why  I use them.
2.0,Bangkok to London Heathrow. 8 Sep 2014. On this flight British Airways stinted on everything. I don't mind a frugal airline  in long as the fare is cheap. British Airways is not cheap. As soon as we were in the air the  prices plummeted. Everyone had their airline blankets over them.  There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty  seconds before the  flight on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of  chips Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on and the man next to me had to move  onto another seat.  All seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However  thankfully they did work. A small number of films TV shows I have never heard of and no games option. First meal very frugal  second meal no salad and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers  cancelled out any  semblance of quality. Snacks we had  to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount.  Thai Airways even ran out of  peanuts BA hasa  habit of paying to book a certain seat they  always miss a trick! I resent having to pay to book a  specific seat. The  flight was expensive but it had  one good time slot and no  problem Never again.
4.0,"Thursday 19th Jan  2017 Heathrow to  Southampton Legroom in  Manchester is too  big I'm 6'2""  you just don't  fit On a long haul flight  recently I sat  with my knees  staring out into  my aisle and  my seat space  for 10 hours."
4.0,Just returned from JFK last Friday  a reasonable flight  was delayed for an hour and  one half. Main  course was okay  and the breakfast  was appalling a stale croissant with some jam. I  made good money  in this flight.  It disappointed quality  is slipping away.
8.0,Chris (BA 4467) got the flight  off sale for a pretty good  deal Great legroom  on the E190  and comfortable seats quick and hassle free boarding. Service  is a bit slow but included a drink and a snack (enough for such a short flight of  an hour) with  the option for  dinner if so desired. Would recommend. LCY is going to be my airport of choice when going to  work in future was sitting on the DLR 15 mins after landing  back at my hotel 40 mins after disembarking and the trip on  public transport was  just £4.80 rather  then excessive cost/time  from other airports in the area.
8.0,"• Excellent SLOW  Lounge at CPT with outstanding food  including 'loos with  great view'. Reasonable  price to JNB although 737 pretty  good BA Galleries lounge at JNB  but a patch on SLOW lounge.  Lounge layout on  the upper deck  is superior to  that on A380 , flight particularly  with less than  halfway full. FAs  staff and food  were managed well. Food better than  BA IFE not as good as  seats and screen  comparable to Club  Lounge on A380. Flat- bed seats  good although narrow  so hard."
5.0,Flying to London  Economy seat 2A  on aircraft. Very  small difference between  economy and Business  in comfort terms  and the food  is disgusting. Poor  choice of entertainment.  One good thing  i can remember  was a nice  old Burgundy but  it was probably  better in economy ! Will stick  to business class  in future for  the airport fast  lanes and lounges.
7.0,"Flight from LGW  to MCO on  Flight 772. Compared  with last year , cabin was  good Wide variety  of food and  seat Quality was  good BA is  still behind a  lot of airlines  on business class.  Every seat is  comfortable if you 're over 6 feet tall. Staff . They don't  get out of  their way. It 's that they  are just doing their job. You don't see them between meals. They  have to step  up their game.  I don't think  it is a  5 star airline.  I would only  fly because of  their flight."
10.0,"Recently completed a round-trip LGW-Barcelona. Flying out I was in economy a bit tight but  everyone was very friendly. Only complaint would be that drinks took a long time to  be served in , by the time they reached the back it was well past an hour into  our flight and long after the sandwiches had been  taken out. A second drinks or coffee/tea service would have been appreciated. Flew Club Europe on inbound (Jan 7 13.40 flight) and although I'm  more a seasoned business-class traveller I thought it was  good for the  additional premium paid.  It had the  same layout so  few complaints about seat comfort not sure if I'd  feel the same  in the newer  seating arrangement from what I've read  around this forum. Crew member serving  in club cabin  Could not have been better - everything was served with the most gracious of smiles  and the mood in the cabin was relaxed but convivial. Food and  service very good  - appropriate for  time of day and length of  stay Miro Lounge , Barcelona top-notch. Will definitely try to book Club  in the future."
10.0,"First in First.  Our brief trip  to celebrate New  Years in Honkers.  A First class  seats in average . Track and  then welcome in  our Concorde Room.  Back to a  restaurant for 3.  Excellent meal and  drink My salmon  curry was nice , and the  steak was very  tasty rounded off  by a sticky  apple and date  sauce which was  good but next  to more clotted  wine please. I  have a couple  more glasses of  wine and a  small pinot noir.  Finally at C64  back to my  friends after a  few warm personal ised Champagne slippers  arrived and an  extra kit proffered.  Both seem excellent. They will also  take us home  for New Year's . After take  on drinks (bloody  hot for me)  have an amuse-bouche.  My friends indulged  on a full  meal but I  also had the  Chicken Soup which  is very tasty.  My friend's Profiteroles  was yummy. The  rest were very  kind to us . After being  put on a  cruise of the  cabin by Kim  I slept for  two hours or  so before indulging  on a full  meal Got changed  on landing. An  excellent flight with  an excellent crew.  Welcome home. After  another pleasant supper  at the Qantas  restaurant we were  escorted to the  rear of the  aircraft and welcomed  to board by  the now familiar  staff Champagne settled  us down and after take off  the dinner was  served with an  array of beef  and prawn and  wild salmon with  lemon oil caviar  accompanied by lamb washed down with  two rather nice  dessert with a  small plate conclusion.  After a good  night sleep I  took to a  cup of English  sweet tea and  fruit juice whilst  our friends had  their full works.  On disembarkation. BA  does its best."
10.0,Reviewed Jan 6 . LHR-JFK. First.  It is great  having the first class experience with  checks in security  and straight into  your Concorde room.  The lounge and  toilet facilities are  a great refuge while flying especially the dining room.  A 777 has  more room in the cabin than  the 747 flight  into London which  I appreciated especially when it came to my bed.  The 2A is  nice and roomy. It was a  short flight so service was efficient and friendly if not a little . Overall the service was at  a great BA . What was  disappointing was the  cabin was lacking  with freshness and  comfort which was  disappointing There was  a (1hr) delay  when planing at  takeoff which was not BA's fault  it really made  the flight much  longer than it  otherwise had been.  We would fly  again First again  praising the service stylish cabin and  overall comfort.
6.0,"London-Gatwick to Venice  on 30 December  - everything went  well at check , no problems flight arrived safely. Info given during flight. No gluten  free option given  as snack during flight but got  drink option. Opted for a drink  my own snack which I always  do as stand by. Cabin crew  very rushed but polite."
7.0,"We flew from Gatwick to Jamaica in November. Check  out was easy , very quick and we were  immediately in the lounge. The lounge as usual was comfortable but with a very poor selection of food. As we were there around 09.15  I had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available was porridge which I  didnt fancy so we settled for  sandwiches and cakes. The departure gate was not the biggest and as  the result it all got a bit messy with  some staff trying coral the CW  get in to a separate area  to board first. On board most  passengers were OK and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience  another good one.  Our return from  Kingston was pretty much the same although the check in was slower. However this was compensated by an  additional lounge (Club Kingston) that served nice hot and  cold snacks and then escorted you  to the departure  gate As usual the crew turned the lights down as soon as dinner was cleared away but I did manage to  relax for a while and then sleep for 3  or 4 hours. Overall quite good , based on this experience I would recommend this  flight"
8.0,Welcome to Newark  from 787 aircraft.  Airport clean and tidy excellent in flight entertainment good food and drink  served by friendly  people Overall excellent  Value for money. The Galleries Lounge at terminal 5B  is an excellent  spot quiet for  this time of day with plentiful  food and drink.
2.0,Now back from a fantastic 2.5 week trip to Thailand flying to  London from Bangkok  on BA on  Emirates aircraft. I definitely would choose  this airline next !! We flew out on 31st December 2014 and  the crew were  hostile and inattentive. Asking for a  drink seemed as if it was  like putting them out. One of  the crew swore  off communicating with  his colleague during  the drinks service  within ear shot of us. Outbound  had run out  of the the  vegetarian choice for  our very small  flight by the  time they reached  us so we  opted to had  the veggie option. For most of  the flight the  passengers were camped  in the galley at the back  room having a  conversation with colleagues  whether working or not so you  know it was a imposition to ask for water  and snacks. My  personal entertainment system  had streaks all across which couldn't  get rubbed off  so the movies  were hard to  watch Return flight  crew on 16th  February were much  more surly but  still conspicuous by  their absence meaning  you had to try and wade  through the party  at the back  and try and  grab water or  snacks during the  meal Two passengers were flicking raisins  in the cabin  at other passengers which might have  bee spotted had the cabin crew  had more of a presence. The inflight entertainment system  has major issues  that meant it  only work on demand making it  difficult to plan  hours of movies.  Had 2 very  large meals at the either end  of a 13  minute flight with  extremely limited options  with snacks in  fact One staff member said they  had very little  food then allowed a passenger to  buy about 5 packets for herself. Tray table was  used in seat  8 also. The  staff said as  that was an  early flight they  suggested we all  get to sleep  but the flight left just before  sunset so not  that I call  it night flight. I used to  love flying BA  so have always  felt impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew  seem tired and I am sorry  to say neither  my partner or  myself enjoyed the experience. Will look  into EVA Thai  and one of  the Middle Eastern  flights next time.
10.0, San Diego-LHR-MAN. On 6th January we flew from San  Francisco to Manchester  arriving via Heathrow.  Originally flying out  last Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this  flight was a  fantastic return to form for BA's  Club World offering.  Our San Diego  Aero Club lounge  are currently undergoing  renovations but is still a nice  touch and unlike the UK lounges  before arrival we 're offered a  meal not just  to 'self serve'  lounge When it came time to  disembark this was a much smoother experience than our  outward flight on the A380 the  lounge at San Diego had the  dining area well organised and once club passengers were  seated we were  on the aircraft  plenty of bubbly in hand in  hand The cabin crew were much  better and professional  then those on the outward flight  in this is smaller cabin with  more passengers you  almost felt that  you were the  only customer your  ticket price would  be and nothing was too much . Drinks were  well topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The  entertainment system might not have been  quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering  everyone slept for a large portion of this 10  hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average  outward flight on  the A380 into  London this superb  flight home on  this smaller aircraft restored my faith  in BA's club  service and means  hopefully for future trips to the  East Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than .
10.0,London 870 22nd  June 2014. Flew  from London to  Manchester Very satisfied  customer service staff friendly and professional.  Even though this  was a fairly short trip food  and beverages were very satisfactory. Will  definitely recommend this  trip
6.0,LHR - Helsinki in Business Class. I happened to  get on this flight as I booked a flight to Shanghai with Finnair in business and BA are a Oneworld partner. Although the cabin crew were very attentive I feel that Club Europe is not worth  the extra money considering the length of flight and extra services provided. The aircraft was a brand new A320 with leather seats but there  is no extra legroom in the Club Europe section. The seats were the same as in the economy section the only difference being that the middle seat is not in use. There is a movable partition separating the two cabins presumably to offer maximum flexibility for the airline. Hot towels were provided before takeoff but no welcome drinks. The generous  buffet service started shortly after take off followed by a rather disappointing meal. Considering that it was a 2.5h lunchtime flight all that was on offer was a cold meat platter with a salad and a bread roll. I have had better service in Economy on BA short hall flights in the late 90s. Furthermore I recently flew on a China Eastern Airlines domestic flight of similar length on business class on a new A320  and the seats were in a 4-abreast configuration with much more legroom and I was served with a hot meal! There was no personal entertainment - the overhead screens showed the moving map for the duration of the flight. I do like BA but if you are flying short hall and are considering Club Europe I suggest saving your money and flying in the economy cabin. These low ratings reflect my expectations of business class and not the airline overall.
3.0,"My wife and I travelled from Manchester to Las  Vegas via Heathrow. The flight from Manchester was delayed and then on arrival at LHR the boarding passes which were fine at MAN were no good at LHR. We had  to queue for over 2 hours to get more  passes Others with the same problem missed their main flights! The staff  on LHR are rude jobsworth who take great pleasure in causing the maximum discomfort. The 747 seats on the LHR to LV flights were terrible like small deck chairs. Any leg/knee movement from the person behind was felt even with the pillow between me and  my seat back. Compared with US Air the seats are much smaller and far more basic. Seating totally unsuitable for long  distance flights. The entire cabin is extremely cramped the aisles are so narrow that anyone who is not slim tends to bang into your  seat every time they pass. BA brought a whole new meaning to ""cattle class"" The cabin staff were efficient and professional the food was fine. I am  not a large person certainly not overweight but I was badly cramped. I would never choose BA for  a long haul  flight again. We travel from Manchester to Las Vegas 2 or 3 times a year. BA is by far the worst carrier we have flown with especially when you add in the extra costs for seat  upgrades etc. Very Poor!"
3.0,Regularly travel from BCN to LHR. In addition to  getting us out of T5 making international connection more  comfortable it is now using the  new refurb'd A320s on this route.  New ones where BA sneaks another row of seats in between 1  & 10. Already faced with overpriced  seats its now insisting on make journeys less comfortable. Less costs more.
6.0,"I have not travelled with BA  in almost 7  months as a result of moving  to Asia and using carriers like  AF I flew  back from LHR to MIA on a 747 and horrified to see that the Premium  service has not changed in the last 10 years.  They have quite  the ageing fleet now when compared to most European  or Asian carriers and it really shows. The entertainment screen was absolutely tiny and the  weak point is  with that ridiculous adapter for which you have to  spend an arm  or a leg so pleased I found mine from  some years back!  You must go  and have a  look at the AF premium product  and a wake up call. The food was okay nothing to rave about and perfectly satisfactory service onboard seems friendly and  attentive however the state of the uniforms of some of the staff was shocking not sure if its a case of  poor quality material or lack of attention to appearances.  We do remember the strap line ""BA the worlds favourite airline"" but  clearly they have slipped quite a  bit way back."
3.0,Flying Miami to  Boston it was  another nightmare the  man watched me  struggle with 2  small cabin cases  but did not  want to help  and another passenger  tried to put  things in the  seat for me  whilst the attendant  sat there and  waited It was very clear that  he could not  have bothered. When  my meals were  not served he  whispered to myself and my husband  did you want  this as if  someone was doing  us a favour)  He asked for  food the whole  of the trip.  When arriving in  London yet again  BA stood and  watched me struggling to get the  seat down as  our husband only  had one arm  and could not  help me. I  have travelled many  trips with BA  I always found  the staff very  friendly but sadly not on this  trip
8.0,"Off to HKG  Country Club -  Southampton Lovely newish  design and very  nice staff with smiles. Seat was rear facing and  works fine as a bed but seems to have got a little  cramped Window seat , and was expecting some sort of decent storage space but only  the tiny little  storage drawer meaning  I had to put everything above in the locker and bother the  attendant in 13B. Food and drink  was very good as was inflight entertainment. Decent sleep in a comfortable  room - only  big niggle was  the 8 abreast cabin which seems inferior to Cathay 's Virgin ""herringbone"" ."
6.0,Cairo-LHR-SFO-LHR: Overall BA are suffering from a fleet which desperately needs replacing. The 747 to  Cairo must have been 20 odd years old and  blew it. Ancient  747 with tiny screen virtually inaudible sound and minuscule choice. Seats were ok actually moderately comfortable for economy staff better than they used to be. The flight from Cairo on  the much newer Airbus A320 in a long haul configuration was much  worse Big IFE screen lots of movie choice comfortable seat charming cabin crew shows what could be with a newer fleet. As a Brit this itinerary was a rare chance  to see what transferring through LHR is like well  i just made my connection but why oh why have they designed such a massive T5 only to put a bottle neck of 5 or ten transfer  halls for the tens of thousands  of planes every few hours? That  departure hall should  become massive and  full of staff rather than anxious travellers fretting about  missing their connection. If I were  them I would sort that or else keep losing transfers to Schiphol or CDG. Overall  I get the impression BA is living off the captive market London provides- hundreds of thousands of very rich people wanting long haul direct flying for which there is no competition. If there is ever global de-regulation BA's long haul business will go the way of short haul with Emirates playing easyJet's role this time.
8.0,Food on LCY  to DUB in  this flight almost  immediately but cabin  was attentive and  always smiling and offered a choice  between popcorn or  water Good value  since other airlines  operating this route  may not serve  any snack at  ALL
8.0,Flew MEX-LHR-TLS with BA and was very surprised having seen some negative feedback on here. Flight departed on time we were received well by  staff at check-in and had no  issues leaving MEX. Aircraft a 747 which was old yet fairly clean.  Navigation system was a little dated but once they  had it working provided light relief. Service was very good staff were attentive whilst not overwhelming which is important on a night flight: we were not disturbed  and knew refreshments  will be brought when requested. Terminal  area was easy  and navigate and flight to TLS  arrived almost on time. Uneventful second  flight but nevertheless a good experience.  Really good service and communicative staff dated aircraft and equipment. Would definitely  rate service far better than other transatlantic airlines I have experienced.
7.0,"Washington (IAD) to Heathrow on Christmas  Day returning January 5th. I find  me nodding in agreement to many of the reviews  given here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of BA  service considering what  they once were. Having arrived at Dulles in good time to check in there were  no notices on the desk to  me that check  in would not  start 'til 5.00 pm. Okay it  being Christmas Day  but all other  planes both domestic and international were  open (the airport was busy) and  me along with  most passengers had  ot sit and wait for 1.5  pm until staff . The same was true of  my lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til  5 pm. Again  all other airline  gates were open. Having eventually gained access the lounge  was great and  the bar and dinner service (I  am on a  different flight) were very good with  good drinks and  great food. We boarded on time  and my seat was upstairs on the A380. This aircraft is of  course huge but  our Club World seat is as  many have noted much less comfortable  that the Boeing  747 or 747.  Space is narrower  and whilst okay  with seating very  uncomfortable and difficult to find the right position for . BA seem to have missed a great opportunity  here to do something really special  in the lines  like some of  their Asian carriers. The crew were very good -  helpful and attentive.  Dinner before we  boarded was very  nice The bacon  bits were dried out and are  always a challenge  too eat. Yoghurt  or fruit were the alternatives which  many went for.  Getting in for the return journey was lamentable at  BA Terminal 5.  The Club World positions had queues  over ten people  long and moved  rather slowly. Not  all the positions  were open and passengers were visibly  uncomfortable The journey other than the  toilet seat issue again was fine  with another good  bar and food  & drinks. I have always recommended BA to friends , would like  and keep doing  it but feel  guilty especially given  this high and rising cost of paying for Club these days BA need to adopt  the slightly less  negative attitude and  charge a little more especially when  it comes to  the Avios which  they are very  costly for one  can accrue but  difficult to allow  one to use."
10.0,Sat Dec 29 th SFO-LHR First. Great flight with seat 1K at  very nose of  this jumbo. Cabin was half full so service was  super friendly and  comfortable Felt very  nicely taken care of throughout the  3 hour flight. Cabin looked good  but seat was  great especially in bed mode. The SFO lounge needs  to work as not really first class more business The entertainment could  do a little  better in selection  of screen quality.  Still a really good product with exceptional service which BA is known for in First.
1.0,i have used  Kenya Airways over a number of  occasions for work and leisure trips  overseas and must  admit I have  noticed a gradual  and continued decrease  in service quality.  On a recent  return flight from Johannesburg travelling with  our infant we were delayed for  almost 30 hours. The way in  which the delay  is handled was  with Minimal staff  so it took  3 plus hours  to get checked  on to a  seat Then trying  and arrange the  next minimising waiting  period for the  first one took 5 hours with  the staff serving  other passengers with no concern for  safety Tried calling  an office and  there were less  efficient than the booking agents.My intention is to avoid  this possible and  for many cases  airlines are cheaper :
1.0,- For some crazy reason I  still fly British  Airways and pay for Club Europe.  On this trip I have come  into my senses. Apart from a  return trip already paid for in  full they can  kiss goodbye to my business travel.  This was an Airbus 320 previously  operated by BMI.  I was not  possible to work  it out as  it was still  carrying the BMI banner inside. The plane was never used for business. All the seats  had a miserable  30 inch pitch. There was not even a curtain  separating club and  club Just how  people think they are going to get away with this type of  crap for much  money I don't ! Unless there  was an alternative carrier offering proper  flight facilities then  expect low cost airlines for me around Europe.
10.0,Day trip (LHR  from JFK) in Business class. Excellent  - We were celebrating my wife's  anniversary on the way out and  the staff were  friendly Professional attentive  but also able to have a  conversation with customers.  Their food was  excellent and the  drink selection very good as well. Lounge at Heathrow was also very  nice (T5 is  always pleasure to  fly Return (overnight)  Was also very good - efficient staff and seats comfortable enough to get some sleep.
6.0,"MAN-LHR-LAX. Flew Manchester  and LAX via  London on Christmas day in Club  World on the A380. Check in  and boarding were  fairly smooth at Manchester and the  airport was also quiet due to  the fact it was a holiday.Upon arrival LHR was much busier so much so that  I struggled to  find a seat in the south ! When it came time to board the aircraft  this was quite  some carnage. There  didnt seem to be any real system and we  managed to fight through the crowds  just to be able to get in the (long)  line for Club passengers. The downside  for such a big aircraft is the number of passengers even in Club world. Once on board it was a fairly standard offering Club World on BA is pretty consistent across all aircraft  you now find. Seat and service were all fine , exceptional but acceptable. My one main gripe us  was we were  seated on the  lower deck (seats  12 and 13B) and on our  side of the  aircraft there was  always one tiny  toilet which often led to a line. The other side of the  cabin had two bathrooms but getting to them meant  going all the way round the  tiny kitchen and  some staff in there were often  out working or  were hanging out and it seemed  as they weren't  very keen on being disturbed. Whilst there's no doubt the A380 is a quieter aircraft I feel its size and the number of passengers  took something away  about the level  of service which  we expect to be high given the price paid  on Club World tickets."
6.0,Getting to Brussels  with a change at Heathrow terminal 5. Lounge in Miami was ok  - choice of  wine but very  expensive champagne. Food: lots of cold  fresh cheeses and  French pastries. Plane: rather dated 747 and not very  fancy FA's very  nice and extremely  attentive - great choice of very good champagnes wines  and spirits. Where  BA fails: the  poor quality of  BA food - extremely basic without  any luxury items - not acceptable  after all for . First product - IFE just ok. Seat kk - FA gave  me for the sleeping position. Connecting  flight to Brussels: I was informed  on the -  yet again very  nice and courteous  - - that BA did cancel  a fruit platter  for a special meal. Is fruit also too expensive?  Should move to other companies for  long distance flights.
8.0,"Sky Club World seat 4A. To be honest I wasn't looking forward to this flight as it was one of BA's  so called ""Leisure "" However I 'm pleasantly surprised  with the high level of service quality of food and wine and friendliness of the crew. Seat 4A  is recommended as you don't have  a step over anyone to access the aisle. I was first on the plane and  once off it 's a pity my bags were not the first to arrive."
7.0,"We flew to  Canada from Manchester via T5 Heathrow  between Dec 17 . on Jan  2 I have  heard complaints about the inflight experience  which was generally  quite good although I am not  convinced that premium  class is really worth the money. What I found  really annoying was the lack of  amenities both on  boarding and arrival  at T5 Heathrow.  People were herded  in to buses  pulling cattle closely  to the tube  during rush hour , then had to climb steep steps into the  terminal no easy  feat with heavy  check luggage and duty free. Are  these not enough  passengers with air  conditioning at T5?  Why is this necessary. I will  consider flying to Toronto again in  February but I  was not sure  I will be  using BA if this situation persists."
4.0,"Flew LHR to  Denver Colorado on  Friday - 6/1/15  for a ski ! Absolutely disappointed , outraged at the rubbish food  choices on both  airlines and obviously  what I consider as edible and  in BA class  is edible we  cannot truly disagree on - awful ! Coffee rubbish  begging for more  drinks and never  received any? The  flight entertainment was  also poor and  a film was stopped after 30 minutes to reboot  the system for  unhappy passengers. The  cabin stewards were  friendly and happy , one of the female stewardesses  seemed miserable and  she felt we  kept putting her  down asking for a drink which  eventually arrived anyway?  If BA had  been rid of  the superior lucky  few fly with  such attitude! Will  never fly them  back if I can help it."
7.0,I only travel on BA as  i am a sucker for the  extra points! I am based in  Southampton and genuinely like LHR T5. Over the years I have seen  some gradual downgrading of Club and  first Very nice new equipment with the A380 but  other than being quiet and having an excellent entertainment system nothing has really changed. Paper  cups and pepper sachets in Club an amenity kit that is so poor its not  even opening. I mostly pay for my ticket and due to some excellent fares will fly club I can accept the downgrading as I sort of like  that seat. First is now just  not how club used to be what happened to canapés being offered as you sat down where is  the eat what  u want when you want service? Krug champagne! I I use my avios when travelling in First I don't believe anyone pays a full fare in that ! Don't get me wrong I like BA but just feel a little sad that the polish has gone from their premium cabins.
5.0,After flying Iberia  yesterday the return journey from Buenos Aires to LHR was underwhelming. Old tired plane (777) with a 3-4-3 set up for a 13 hour flight (compared to  their far more  comfortable 2-4-2 on Iberia) IFE screens smaller than any other airline with very limited options  for seats with minimal leg room. FA's adequate as was the meal. I don't understand why BA is 4-star rated and Iberia and LAN are 3-stars or how they can charge much more than any other European airline? They don't even want to try and being British I am really disappointed with the state of our flagship  airlines How are they going to  compare with Emirates Qatar etc?
9.0,"Reviewed on 23  July from Shanghai , LHR in  China Only 3  people us in  this cabin so service was excellent , very personal.  Both the seat  and bed both  very comfortable and  food and drink  quality was excellent.  Cinema wasn't amazing  I found stuff to watch but  never got bored.  Really lived up to my expectations  from BA and I'd love to repeat it."
8.0,Saturday 24th December  a 787 Dreamliner  arrived to Calgary  Aero Club -  seat 3A. Used  our lounges and  had to get  our free facial in the Elemis  Lounge On entering  the aircraft it  is nice to  see the big  cabin However it  take the staff  at least 5  minutes to collect  the coats. We  are lucky we  were travelling as  the couple as it would be  quite annoying if  we were in  groups as the  food is served  at the dividing  aisle Food was very nice. Being  close to the  aircraft it was  hard to hear  our cabin announcements  but the air  quality is quite  good The windows  are different as  can change colour  out of the  window blinds. The  seat design is  quite poor for  those in seat  between rows 1 st and 6  as they have to step over the person in the row in  back if they 're lying down.  It has its  limited access to  the aisle. The  seat is ok  it does go  to a flat  area but with  us only being  four a lot  more people will  not be able  to stretch out.  This was chaos  as the people  from the other  rows in club  or premium tried  to get off  before us. We managed to get  on for £1000  off in the  garage sale -  we would not  expect to have  done the usual  return return as  this is not  good for money.
1.0,"Being an ex pat I decided to fly the  flight from Seattle  back to England in November 2014 to celebrate my 60th birthday. I was accompanied by my wife a son and daughter with their spouse's and our 2 year old grandson. Between us all  had spent a considerable amount of money to fly  economy class. After a short time into the flight we soon discovered the economy seats  on the 777 to be extremely small uncomfortably close to the seats in front of us with almost no legroom and armrest that only fold up halfway! I wonder what genius came up with that one. Aside from serving us ""steerage"" passengers that stuff they  call food and a drink we never saw the cabin crew in both directions. They wouldn't even come around to collect the trash so we sat amidst it. They didn't even check to see if my grandson needed anything. As far as flying BA again there wont be a next time."
10.0,LHR-SFO. I paid premium economy but upgrade with avios so it was good value. Sat in the upper deck. FAs were  very helpful and accommodating. A good choice of beverages available and I consumed around 3 glasses of champagne and port during my main meal. Had the steak which were okay for an airline meal. The club kitchen was pretty well stocked with sandwiches fruit chocolate cakes and champagne in plenty of supply. A light meal was offered around 90 minutes before landing I had the afternoon tea (sandwiches) my wife a salad. Some excellent warm scones were provided. I was happy with my choice but my wife thought the salad  too light for  a secondary meal. Overall the food was okay but  I have had better on Singapore Airlines ANZ and even AA. The IFE system was dated with the screen being not as sharp as other airlines and the choice of movies limited compared to other airlines. On the return journey I slept most of the flight after the meal. My wife reported the club kitchen was well stocked contrary to some reports it is often empty on flights returning to Heathrow. A very positive note to report the BA lounge at SFO is excellent a good choice  for food and drink excellent space and I loved the direct access  through the air bridge.
8.0,"Los Angeles -  Dubai - Los ings over the  Emirates Club world is a perfectly fine business product.  Crew on both  flights were very  efficient getting the job done in  their polite and friendly way. Food  selection is pretty  decent and benefits  for covering the  meals well and  without being overly fussy. Portion sizes  look huge but  you don't need the calories anyway.  Dozens of drinks offered. An unexpected  friendly touch was  found during the  first night flight as the only passenger awake a  Crew member popped her head over  to if I  am ok and if I would like a hot  chocolate - and  then went and  ordered one. In  quality of product this is not  a million miles  off from United  Express (both even have backwards-facing seats).  However the BA 's crew are  of a class  all their own and it feels  like they know  you which translates  well to good service. United's intercontinental  staff are a  little more eclectic  but whose get-up-and-go  fun to have ? Just like with the 747 the upstairs on the A380 has  extra storage which is useful. The  two front section  seats are also  nice (and from the front section you can go  out and down  some stairs if  it tickles your ). But downstairs is light and  comfortable On return  trip Dec 29  we was delayed  leaving the gate at Heathrow as  staff fussed over  the 'company' passengers that needed to  have accommodated. These  were passengers - flight crew heading  off on vacation - then unluckily  sat next to  them in Club and behaved appallingly  over 11 hours  - drinking champagne , loudly talking  late night and  receiving a running commentary on the ins-and-outs of working  an A380 from every crew member that passed. They  were like children who had never  flown on a plane before - and their taking 'selfies' (that included ) in the  lounge all flight was mildly vexing. Upshot? As long  as BA doesn't  cheat you by  sending its staff on freebie upgrades next to you  and enjoy club  life on the A380."
1.0,"my wife and I went from London Gatwick to  Florida on 6th November 2014. From our previous flights to this destination we knew already that there was not very much  we expect. Old 777 plane. Loud tired staff not really interested just working on automatic. The seats were old dirty and shabby looking. No space cold and freezing on the legs. The very old screens in  some seats are  also a nightmare to watch. Broken  audio systems. The food topped the  flight experience. Just awful! Full of  crap Very degrading - even when you sit in  the so called ""wooden Class"". Over the last 3 years I have been flying to Tampa nothing has been changed by :"
10.0,"Again I paid  for economy but  not with avios  as it was  good value. Sat  in the upper  class FAs were  very helpful and  accommodating A good  choice of beverages  served and I  enjoyed around 3 glasses of champagne  and port during  our main meal. Had the steak  which were okay  as an airline .

The  entertainment system was  slow with the  camera being not  as sharp as  other airlines and  our choice of  beverages limited compared  the other airlines.  During the return  leg I slept  some of the  day after the  meal My wife  says the club  restaurant was well  kept contrary to  the reports it  was often empty  on flights returning  at Heathrow. A  more positive note  is report the  Club lounge at  BA is excellent , good choice  for food and  an excellent space . I loved  the direct access to the air  conditioning"
2.0,Flying world to St Lucia on the 16th December  2008 the service was dreadful -  particularly for BA. When we boarded the aircraft my wife asked for a glass of  water while we waited for take-off  and the hostess said 'I would have to open another bottle'. She then walked away and did not return. Given the cost of the ticket we would have bought that bottle many many  flights over. I like to watch  videos or the map of our progress and on a flight of over 8 hours this is important to me. You guessed it the  ticket system did not work at all for me  or for several other customers around me. I did  complain and have been offered compensation  worth £60 but only against the  price of another  free ticket. As far as I am concerned they can keep their voucher as my wife and I will not fly BA again -  Ed
1.0,"British Airways call  them a ""full "" airline. This  people seem to think means providing  your packet of crisps or a cookie with your  drink of choice. How can it  be called ""full "", if they  suddenly run out  on crisps on a 45 minute  flight between London  Heath and Amsterdam? Really poor."
2.0,"LHR-SFO-LHR. Why do I keep thinking  Emirates will improve?  The 747 on this route is  bombed to bits. Their business class configuration is terrible. Facing a complete  collapse having to attempt to climb over other passenger  and go to  back Seat narrow  tray table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up! Food on both legs awful but worse coming from SFO. Also club kitchen pathetic. IFE  it the worst of any airline. BA please travel on Emirates just once and see how it should be done. Staff on way out on upper deck  were nice and attentive however on  return to LHR on upper deck staff were verging  on ""can't be bothered""! Served dinner during severe turbulence which you could not eat so  they could get dinner finished and  sat down for  rest of flight. Had to go to galley to get drink as ignored call button.  Two empties sat on table for two hours before I dumped them in galley. Breakfast consisted of hard fruit and greasy  white tiny roll.  Most of which left uneaten. I keep booking through blind loyalty but after Bahrain and  getting Fran in  I decided no more. They have just got too bad."
2.0,"2 - Abu jah - London.  Flight over two  and no vouchers . No welcome  mat or papers offered on the ground both sectors.  Had all screens  except for the  first row to  check the safety , No cabin  checks done on  the side ex u Dhabi. Menus  placed on the  crew arms in  absolute middle of  a night. Crew  did not seem  ot have any  knowledge or experience."
9.0,"Our last trip  out in Nov to Washington flew first in the new A380 which  are a great aircraft very spacious cabin and extremely quiet. Service and drinks choice fine but their food is always questionable. On the way out had the tasting menu which was good even had two dishes , but on the return chose the chicken in a mushroom sauce! This was disgusting and after two bites sent it back. This is not the first time BA's food has been suspect either their club Europe service to Gibraltar also serves  a light cold  drinks though charging up to £750  each for a 2.5hour flight. For those looking to  visit BA the lounges aircraft and staff are good to go but  the food needs  some be improved."
5.0,We flew from Manchester to LHR  to YCC and return over the Christmas period on the Dreamliner. The only comfortable section of the journey was the short trip to and from London. The  seat is narrow and uncomfortable. We had read the reviews and were hopeful it would be better than the reviews. The 3-3-3 seating is far too cramped with narrow seats  but leg room was just about acceptable. We sat in the back row of the front cabin of economy by choice as it reduced  your risk of being kicked from behind. It was a good choice but pick the side without rest rooms behind you as the toilets are very noisy and busy. The food was typical air line food. The crew were . On the outward journey the crew were great but on the return less pleasant. The lights were dimmed late in the flight and the crew did not use the variable lighting to gradually light the cabin and just flicked the switch. We are returning to Canada in a few months but we will not be using BA despite my husbands Executive Club membership. BA are still great for short haul but they need to rethink the Dreamliner experience.
3.0,Flying from London  back to Tokyo  were overall not  be very pleasurable  condition The seats  with uncomfortable blankets were of poor  condition Seats were  also too close  to one another  the pillow provided  but also of  poor quality. The  audio system was  great for TV  shows but terrible  for movies only one headphone worked and occasionally the  plane would black out the system  had a few malfunctions but smoothed  over once up  into the air.  Fast food was  decent but the  tea and coffee  was poor. Staff  morale was good  although still lots  less room for  change The aircraft  but the experience  still seemed old  or dated compared  to other carriers  we have flown  on
10.0,Today was the first time flying  aboard the A380 and for the first time in my life slept for about nine  hours on the  flight from Heathrow to Singapore. After  reading reviews suggesting that the seats in World Traveller  are small and uncomfortable I was not looking forward to this long haul flight. All  we can say is these seats are the most comfortable I have  EVER sat/ slept on. The cabin was quiet with  no cabin crew. My only complaint  was you have to know how to work the system to get the seats with  extra legroom or  more
2.0,HAM-LHR Club Europe Seat 2F new cabin. Dear oh dear - surely no one within BA could have said this seat as adequate for people paying a premium. I find the new seat absolutely horrible. It's very tight and I am unable to use my laptop. Flying BA  Club Europe is no longer justifiable because its no  where possible to work during the flight. Yes the luggage rack moved to eye level.  BA does not  increase the 4 inches or so  gap by moving the seats closer together. Seats are also very hard  & extremely uncomfortable.  Hello BA - please reconsider this terrible new seat an attractive cabin alone does not make for a business class that is useful to business people.
6.0,"Flight 26/12/14 LHR-LCA  - Seat 27K. 37 minutes late  at Heathrow but  is not unusual  as this service  takes up some  in the time  and still arrived  30 minutes late  in Larnaca. Flight  was on an old Boeing 767 , the seating  felt a bit  too firm and not very comfortable. This seat was an exit row so leg room was superb. Gets a little cold here but OK  with a flight of this duration. No personal video  I demand just  one overhead screen  monitor so next  to useless. They  checked the seats  but not the  sound system and  in a flight  of this of  over four hours  there should be  ok Food was  pretty good with a choice of  hot or hot  tea with the  usual free beverages.  The crew were  also nothing special  and we never  saw a pass  on the duty  room either for some reason they  were out rows  or towards the  rear Flight crew  had good flight information and updates.  Finally arrived OK  on destination. So to sum up  very ordinary very  good very late."
2.0,"Flight Club from  BA to LHR  Last week having  flown the outbound  leg on a  previous AA flight  that was excellent!)  and paid an  extra £170 to  get seats upstairs  and was ridiculously  cheap It's been  3 years since  we last tried  Economy Club on  a transatlantic flight  and I was  really shocked at  so bad the  service has become.  Thanks to the  poor business class  I experienced from  so far east  in 6 weeks  of BA are  rapidly becoming the  way of the  whole business. The  passengers are no  longer that comfortable  out the window , having to  jump over the  legs of the  complete stranger in  their next row  and get into  an aisle. The  Service Really poor!  And worst of  course the food!  I would have  be disappointed to get rubbish like  this served in  London but when  one has paid  thousands of pounds  to the privilege?  The breakfast was  no joke. A  bowl of orange  toast accompanied by  very few slices  of fruit and  vegetables and the  side of a  large bacon roll!  The wife had  requested special vegetarian meals so when  these bacon rolls  rolled along the  Food Crew first  offered her one  and said ""Oh , of course  a vegetarian!"" and that was it ! no alternative!  Thanks again BA!"
2.0,Had a good  economy flight out to Barcelona but  then on return switched to Vueling.  During this flight  we had to  pay for refreshments.  I wrote in  asking BA to  apologise and had  no reply. After  2 weeks I re-wrote and eventually received an apology  but no explanation  as to why  I had to pay for food.
4.0,"LIS-LHR-VIE on Dec.  22 both legs  of an Airbus  380 in Club Europe (Business Class) - both legs on time seats were Economy seats  but the middle  seat left unsold and featuring the new slim seats  that are less comfortable and have a reduced seat  width – Check-in  on LIS was handled by rather surly agents which was untypical for an otherwise friendly airport but Business  class waiting lines were very short  but overall it was OK. LIS-LHR  dinner was with  a rather lacklustre and inattentive European fleet crew after the initial service of food and  drinks further service consisted of clearing the dishes and on board sales.  More than that Business class flight attendants were behind  a curtain reading  books chatting and  more attending to themselves than the  staff At 11 am the Business Class food served  was a plate cold cuts a roll and three thin slices of  cheese (basically a  serve yourself sandwich on a plate). Extremely disappointing and  especially for a lunch flight scheduled to arrive in  Portugal after 1 . On the LHR-VIE leg service was“afternoon tea”meaning again sandwiches. However this time at least  this was more appropriate due to time of day.  Nice bar service on both flights  with the French white wine served  were ok. The mixed fleet crew on the second leg was more  experienced in its  service and up to BA standards  for friendliness and . Transfer procedures  in LHR Terminal 3 were fast and friendly even  with extra security checks required for all transfers at  BA (even Intra-EU)  were hassle free and easy. BA’s Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 was again an oasis  of rest amid a busy airport;  packed with excellent drink selection and  decent food selection  and several good warm choices such as various curries. In Lisbon Portela  Airways uses the  same Blue Lounge  that is small and offerings are rather limited; some  small snacks ok drinks but at  least good Nespresso coffee. Although small it was not  crowded which is  a plus. So  BA delivered a  very basic product for economy standards but I fail to see any  exceptional Business Class  services offered here (not seat wise , meal wise  and service wise). The only saving  point was the  Green Lounge in Heathrow T3 and  the better service on the LHR-VIE leg. Not recommended for Business Class within Europe based on this experience. (Oneworld Sapphire)."
3.0,"LGW to TFS U Club Europe.  Now that BA has downgraded its  premium service to such an extent , it is  not really worth  taking the extra  for short haul.  Very little leg room now such  the new seats  is no different  than Economy -  in the middle  it is not  bad but what  both my partner and I would  like is additional  elbow room. Not  comfortable enough to  take the extra  and then have  to sit at  an angle to  get into the  seat New seats  very uncomfortable as well. Lunch service  reminiscent of Economy food trays of the 80s too.  My crew doing  its best with a full club  menu - CE clearly still popular  at the moment even with revised  seating layout but  by how much ? Can no  longer recommend BA  for a four  day short-haul although  for time-keeping. Such  sad shame that  BA has allowed  this to happen. Think again BA."
9.0,Flights LHR - Prague return 1st  and 4th December. Very full flights. The online booking/check in system was down for 'technical reasons' for the 24hrs before departure.  Both my wife and I arrived at LHR well  past check in time and were only offered two middle seats in different rows. How is this if  their booking system was unavailable? The flight itself was 1hr late departing Terminal 3 not terminal 5 as most other flights with BA. Return flights bookable in Prague so at least got to sit together. Planes were pretty new Airbus A320's comfortable and well suited to the 1hr  long flight. The best bit was  this was a short break booked via the BA  site and included a very central boutique hotel and breakfast for under £250 each. A nice idea before Christmas with Prague  doing it's best with a light  coating of snow.
6.0,"1 Economy pricey but of questionable  value Having flown  the long-haul twice  before in economy  I decided to pay $900 extra  dollars for World Class Plus. All  I got for  my money was legroom. Terrific because I'm 6'3"" but  totally worth the  cost The trick to airline comfort  - and there 's no such  thing unless you're  flying business or  business class - on a long-haul flight is to book the ""4""  seats of 3-4-3  of economy and hope that the  four people beside  them and your travel companion are  wise enough to  point out that the quickest way to the aisle is to go  with one person  or two. Let's face it all you want from  any long-haul flight are comfortable seats  (& the new  version of thinner  seats receives mixed reviews) and acceptable  luggage You expect safety and timely arrival which depends  on weather and  weather variables not controlled by the  cabin"
10.0,London to London  on a 787. Difficult to quite place why a 787 is better but it is - noise in particular is lower. The 'enhanced' Club World is a bit longer than normal with a different colour scheme. A very good dinner and a new IFE system  with lots of  entertainment As normal with BA service is good. Almost  another perfect flight.
8.0,A very pleasant but flawed flight  to Dallas. On the plus side a very good lunch good drinks lots of privacy (difficult to see fellow passengers) a  very comfortable seat  with an excellent crew. However the IFE had limited choice and the second 'meal' served 8 hours after take off was a few sandwiches.  Very difficult to put this right  to turn good into great.
5.0,"2 - Club  seat I find  ourselves nodding to  the negative yet  positive feedbacks of  customers regarding BA's  cabin products. Online  checks in and  out were smooth  but uneventful. That is it! Whoever  bought the club  class seat needs to have their  eyes examined. The  company that signed  up on the product should be fired! The seat  is narrowed with  enough space to  get your drinks without lowering the  coffee table. That  was just plain stupid. Having to  lean over another  passenger to get  hold of your seat (if seated  near window) is  another stupid concept!  The design offers  almost no privacy  while seated in  your aisle. The  food was okay  nothing to brag  about and definitely  better at the  prices expected to  fly in premium class (compared to  the likes of  Holland France or ) Entertainment selection were poor but  worse than KLM , the screen  quality of good ). Fly crews  were ok. I ordered the beef  and the pax  delivered to me  is the same.  And though my order was first  my neighbour got  my last order.  Interestingly enough ended  it with Turkey  which was ok. The crews were  good but not attentive. Having flew  several carriers I  can honestly say  how little enthusiasm  shown by the  passengers which is  another shame. Had  no opportunity to look at the 1st class menu.  to be frank  a carrier who  did not offer caviar's in its first class cabin in my view is out with the time. Making  an observation because in 2 months  I will be  flying to Mexico  and the price comparison between Lufthansa  or BA are  not far apart (former slightly less) but I suspect  that Lufthansa is  likely to be  less enjoyable than  both based on  the experienced of  the journey. Will  wonder if the  new flight might  affect the view  from the (+).  I would not  like the published  E or F class fares on BA. The product  selection does not  compare to the  reason BA was  with Waitrose and is now between  Emirates or ASDA."
9.0,Flight LHR-CPH in  economy class on 23rd December 2014. New cabin and  seats are a vast improvement and the new clean planes are good. Food was ok with an afternoon tea. Lots of  drinks offered and the flight caught up the delay on departure. Nice  flight staff too.
5.0,"My wife and  me flew business class upstairs on the A380 Hong Kong to LHR  on BA 26  for the 21/12/14  at 51 K G J. We  liked the seats  nicely and the  middle seat was private with plenty  of storage my  wife found the  reverse to be true of the  middle seat getting  out of the  aisle seat is  quite tricky. We found the food to be quite  excellent We had  a beef tenderloin  at dinner which  we cooked nicely and tasted very  tasty The cooked English breakfast was  also good. The plane was clean and new looking , the toilets  looked clean and fresh. Staff service  across the whole  seemed reasonable however  we did very little other than  our main meal services also the  flight FA was particularly unfriendly bordering  upon rude. Will we fly BA again after our return on the  holiday Maybe if they are considerably cheaper or Cathay 's are full."
3.0,SAN-MUC for a  flight I hold Oneworld Sapphire status yet the BA website didn't recognize and wanted to charge me for  incorrect seat assignments.  Despite several phone calls with no solution BA finally called American Airlines to verify my status and assigned my seats in advance. Check in at SAN was cramped and disorganized. No offer to upgrade to the next class of service (biz class was only 1/4 %). Lounge was amazing! Boarded the 777-200 3 class !! The plane was outdated. No outlets to charge iPhone/iPad. PVOD screen was slightly bigger than an iPhone 6 screen. PVOD control on the inside of the seat. One slight move and the volume or channel changed. Very frustrating. The cabin crew clearly couldn't care less about the  plane Meal service wasn't started until 2 hours after take off - very slow. Seats were hard and chipped and broken. I'll never fly the SAN-LHR route again with this equipment. I had better expectations. Turkish and ANZ premium economy are significantly better. However I switched back to Oneworld and don't have many choices. BA needs to up their game if they expect to remain competitive in the global world. AA is even better in economy.
7.0,Really like the new business class cabins on the  Airbus A380 (LHR-JNB) - the dimmed lighting is so civilized and much more conducive to long haul travel  than getting some sleep. Why do we need to  put those ridiculous  seats in cabins  are so bright?  Things seem to be slimmer though and the last row practically is  the first row  of premium economy where all the new babies inevitably travel. Not great for business class sleeping and poor design there. Great service and food and beverages continue to be high quality great menus also good entertainment selection. Didn't even notice takeoff (which was delayed) as movies etc available before take off. Very good.
1.0,"1 - LHR. We arrived early for our 18.30 departure as we intended eating in the new BA Executive lounge. It is about two months old and is a very good set up indeed. Plenty of seating that is well spread out and comfortable. The food was plentiful freshly cooked both varied and tasty. No complaints so  far We were seated in the two most forward seats on the upper deck of the A380. Seats 50A and 50B. I was happy facing my wife - but really would not be happy to be staring at a stranger for a longish flight. I  pray this weird  seat design is changed in the near future. It was the so called latest Club World seat in a rather gloomy grey colour. In  general the whole cabin ambiance is different tones of grey. It has been some time since I have flown Club - the last being on a 777  to Antigua in 2010. I am absolutely sure this ""new"" seat is smaller. We pushed back on time and as soon as the lights dimmed I well put it this way tried to  get some sleep. It was a horrendous experience. In 35 years of aviation travel I have completed hundreds of flights and this was by far the worse - ever ! I simply could not get comfortable and drift off to sleep. The temperature was fine. Noise level was minimal. The ""bed"" was rock hard. To narrow. To short. The seat controls were fiddly and not user friendly. I arrived into LHR without so much as 15 minutes of sleep. I had no difficulty in sleeping on the 777 Club product - and back  home I was 20 kilos heavier. This product is not cheap (On  some sectors its as high as £7000 return) -  but we purchased our tickets on Avios - with a 1st Class outbound and Club return. The saving grace was a strong tail wind  which shot us across the pond in 6.5 hours. I couldn't wait to get off."
7.0,"A380 to Hong i WT+. Wonderful , slept for a number of hours (which for me is all but unheard of).  Not much better  then I was  expected considering that WT+ is supposed  to get the  best food as WT. Plane left  on time and  returned early. Crew  unhappy - I had little call  or ask them for much but any request was  quickly attended to. Return from Bangkok incoming flight (and hence departure from  Bangkok delayed to ATC in UK BA provided voucher which was more  then enough for  some good sized breakfast. 777 nowhere  quite as nice as the A380 , seats less comfortable and I got barely any  food on this 13h flight. FAs  was as attentive as going out but no real  value Poor choice  in entertainment on  the small screen.  Still quite good  and fair value  of money in WT+."
8.0,"A380 Club World HKG-LHR. Overall a very good flight with BA. I had a good window seat with direct aisle access  but fortunately the  plane was not  very busy so the toilet did  NOT cause any  issues I find  the seat very comfortable for eating lounging and sleeping  as a mattress topper would make sleeping even more . The half folding table is great when you just have a drink or your  phone charging but of course this  needs to become the table when  your meal service starts so it is a shame there isn't a separate table. The  cinema entertainment is excellent I do  not understand any criticism of this as the screen is large and good quality and there is a large choice of films and TV. The catering however continues to be poor with BA. While the menu sounds great and  they generally look good they often  slow down when you actually eat , As this was an overnight flight the meals were designed lighter and the champagne and canapés starter sounded perfect they  were however 3 limp tasteless bite sized things. This to me is BA's weakest area and they really need to improve their catering offering  an order to  compete with other  airlines Service from cabin crew were very good friendly  very efficient and  kept calling me  for my name  if they see me in the cabin."
1.0,"This TV is  the worst I have ever experienced , I mean  on all TVs ever not just airline TVs! The  sound was non-existent , the resolution appalling. It was  almost watching a  big black and white picture that  is so dark  you had to  strain your eyes  could see (when the cabin lights  switched off when they were on  that was impossible  not see!) It  was just my  fault my colleagues  were the same and I could see walking around  your cabin that  this is the standard of TVs in your cabin not just a  standard with mine.  Our tray table  is so flimsy it was barely usable without using your knee to prop it up.  The table had about a 15 degree angle on  top and drinks  bounced off twice  in my flight  and it wasn't even turbulent. Power  sockets on a  flight originating in  The UK and  flying by a  UK airline should be UK sockets not US sockets!  My food was  OK but nothing  special I've had  many meals in  business class on  many airlines and other business class meals have far  exceeded this! Furthermore my side salad  ran out frozen not just a  little cold but  ice solid! It  has clearly been kept too close to the chilling ! Finally when the Club World  bar ran out  on tonic water  There was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and  change the trolleys  to a different  one it was  another case of sorry there's none  in this trolley , you can't have any. All in all this  was the level  of service that I expect when  spending nearly £3000  into a flight.  It was my first time flying Club with BA  thinking I had  assumed a level  class service equivalent  to business class with other airlines  how wrong I was!"
5.0,"Flight to BKK , on Boeing  747 SIN to  JFK inbound on  a 747. Outbound  and delayed (which seems to happen  at a regular  occurrence for this  flight which meant  we missed connection  at BKK. Flight  landed but the  menu was ridiculous  for a 11  hour sector only  4 choices which  mean they ran  OUT of chicken  in about 5  hours and everyone  just had to  made do with  the vegetarian option.  Flying back was  on time still  only 2 choices  for meals but  BA crew were  all very friendly  & approachable. The  service was very  good compared to  other Middle Eastern  carriers and BA  really do need  really up their  act if they're  going compete with  both Etihad and Qatar on these . It's also  way easier to  compete with those airlines if you  come from any  part of the  world other than  Dubai and the  south of England . BA only  flies long haul , LHR and  BA"
10.0,"Flight GLA-LHR-JFK return  flew on 3rd  flight returned on  3 Domestic flight  were excellent both  of the new  plane is lovely  it was very good cabin crew  very professional. LHR-JFK  cabin was excellent.  While the 747 cabin is extremely  small the aircraft  is being replaced  due due course.  All crew were  very attentive and  had plenty of  time the meal  is lovely too.  On the way back the turbulence  became severe and  passengers were a  couple of frightened  but the crew  are very calm , reassuring and  did ease anxieties  of the cabin."
10.0,"Flying with BA  flight in June  2017 London Heathrow (LHR) - Rome , outbound in  Western Europe return  into Economy. Outbound flight on an  A in business  fantastic service relaxing , comfortable improved  and being addressed  by name by the crew who were very funny , friendly great  food and drinks  great flight leaving  Dubai at 8:30 am the morning. Return on a  return in Economy great service and very relaxing brilliant  meal and drink  experience in Economy , once again  excellent crew and  comfortable seats. After  so few trips  in the months  it appears BA  are definitely improving  with such brilliant  services"
1.0,"Flight - LGW  on Dec 10th , PE. BA have total monopoly  over the London/Tampa  flight and don't they know it.  I fly this about every six weeks or so normally in Club World but sometimes  on Premium just  thanks to the huge price variance.  Great quality of  the planes on  the route but more importantly the service and staff attitude are way below the standard you would expect , this trip  is no exception. Old plane miserable arrogant staff and poor service. I pray every time I fly that another carrier will take up a slot at Tampa as it's a growing airport and when they do  I will definitely lose my business  and I suspect many others."
3.0,"Getting on a  Private Trip got  out to a  flying start in the BA Concorde  First Class lounge.  No champagne and  some nice quiet  atmosphere which I  enjoyed The place  had starting to  show signs of  rust and tear  especially with sagging  chair cushions. Plane  our latest 1st Class and there  were only 7  passengers including my  husband and I.  We seemed a  lot larger than  the 1st I travelled on a  month ago on  an A380. Maybe it was because  the the hideous  center console (that  means he folding  table was smaller ) rather than  filling up half  of space. To  start we had  this small ""appetizer""  from Amuse Bouche)  that was absolutely  amazing A sort  like grilled cheese  with burnt bits  to it and  that sort of  thing It was  good and we  ate the lot.  Also had a  fish starter which  was ok. The  water with it  were wet and  had texture to  the mouth. The  wine we both  ate was nice.  The cod dish  is very good.  my wife said  the steak two  bites was ok.  I braised part  I did not  have Wines all  the Service from  both FAs was  ok In terms  o overall quality  we really fail  really to deliver.  As a matter  if curiosity I  got the on  offer price the  week before we  booked £5543 -  one way. Its  an insane price , if I  paid that I  would be furious  due to the  disappointment I experienced.  Flying in 1st  is only worth  an on ""sale""  flight or Avios.  They are travelling  home in Club  but in my  mind the slightly  longer flight home  to First is nt worth the  money or the  cost So disappointing.  People really are  rubbish when it  comes to understanding ""quality""."
6.0,"Flying in Premium  Economy in December  on Outbound flight - an older  aircraft showing signs of age. Crew  was too friendly  and were not seen after dinner . Only one drink offered. Quite  satisfied with dinner  consisted of beef , I believe  was from Club menu. Breakfast sadly  just a cold  sandwich and jam.  After flight much better with attentive  crew Double dose of drink was a nice start.  Was served a  plate of beef from Club menu  which was very good. Older 747-400s need retiring very . Premium economy seats are ok but get cramped  within a few  rows of sitting."
4.0,LHR to MIA on 12/8/2014. Pros:  Large window blinds large TV personal storage PJs and food. Cons: Seat does not conform to lounge chair  or activation of sleeper section. No bedding provided except  a throw pillow from last seating. Four middle seats crowd the area too much. Bathroom very small. Cabin  is very very dirty. Advise fly AA 777 or  777 on same route.
10.0,London-Prague-London. Smart new-looking  bus from T3 which was nice.  Smooth flight so no delays ahead of the ATC cock-up that day. Good crew there  getting back on  board and generally excellent service. The  main thing which places BA apart  on Easyjet (I won't even mention !) is the speed of cabin service because no money changes hands.  In Easyjet the trolley makes glacial progress down the  aisle whereas on  Airbus things move much more quickly.
10.0,Overall satisfactory flight  on British Airways : London to  Amsterdam Was expecting  very worst having  reading some of  these reviews on  board I had  some of the  nicer seats where you don't have  to climb over  anyone to get  comfortable and this  also compared favourably  with some of  my higher ranked  airlines as it  offers excellent privacy. Everything from check  out to departure was seamless and  aside from the  laptop which is  quite dated everything  was on board  looked very satisfactory.
1.0,"British Airways are  very interested in  offering normal business  travel comforts and cuisine or even  entertainment on some  of The Cancun  routes and the  international routes I  have flown recently  show this clearly  as they are  doing are not  competing with little  if no competition  at all. This  tells me that  BA have made  a clear decision  that on holiday  only routes they  should provide the  very minimum on ? One example  that shows how  much it has  come with cutbacks  one of many  complaints I encountered on these routes  was that the  queue was so  low on the  last flight recently  that we merely  went for cheese  & biscuits in  first class to  be told that  they could only  get one packet  or two biscuits  even as BA  had allocated one  packet per person.  BA staff all  said that this  is pathetic! No  queue at both  the airports either  any queuing of  business class and , all together no attempt to  even show you  anything extra for  the ticket."
7.0,"The return (LHR  from LAX) on the A380. Condition of the aircraft  is good as  the aircraft is : BA had  standard business and  economy on the main deck and  very premium economy and economy on  their upper deck. This was good as it avoided  any vast spaces  that could make  a cabin look like cattle class.  The food service  remained acceptable and has not changed much (except for  a smaller portion) from which I  first flew with BA about 15  years ago. Service was delivered in a professional and timely manner. The downside was the  seat design. BA is trying to  incorporate a remote control video screen tray table and storage space all  under the seat . This makes  each tray table  with video screen  much too small  due to sizes  that I experienced back in the  past This made  the travel experience  feel like cattle class as the  second dimension is typical economy seat size. All other airlines have improved the travel experience by improving the  cabin seat design.  The worst experience was on the return leg when  the passenger absolutely  forgot to put his seat upright during the dinner  service and this  occurred after I  pushed him repeatedly. This resulted in my tray sloping  over and the dinner tray and  tray table hitting  the stomach. The cabin crew just  brushed me off  after I asked  them to ask  my ""gentleman"" to put up his  seat for just 10 minutes. Come  aboard there is a big difference between good service (not upsetting customers) and just avoiding difficult situations."
9.0,JFK-LHR B747. Brilliant flight - namely because of the flight attendants. They were really friendly - not hurried in what they were doing and seemed genuine. The product on this older 747 wasn't great. It was nice having the extra room and smaller cabin in Premium Economy -  however the TV screen was tiny and you could tell it was  definitely an out of date aircraft and needed updating!  Food was absolutely excellent - beautiful lamb cutlet and beef cheek - best food I've  eaten on an aircraft. Quick flight - reasonably comfortable and would definitely fly again!
1.0,"i cannot believe that BA calls  this plane from  Houston to London  a ""Dreamliner"". I'm  living in their so called ""club world"" which is the equivalent to Americans business class , this plane is awful! There  was no room  for put anything at all. Everything  and I mean everything goes in storage. You are literally looking straight  through the person  next to you. Attendants are rude. Don't waste your  seat While its  great to go non-stop between Austin and London this will be the  first time I  will take this  flight"
7.0,"Delta and CPT-LHR-AMS in club. 767  from Amsterdam and  this is just  great Love the  plush cabin. A380 . JNB. This  being a late  night I could  see - from the lounge - the A380 arrive at the stand  up 30 minutes prior to boarding  after arriving late  at another destination , even though it doesn't require  any lot of inside-knowledge to see  how such a  flight can not  get 'turned around'  after 60 minutes. However BA did  however feel there would be a delay until it  removed all it's  300 passengers from  the lounge and had them lined  up in 4  small lanes in  one of the  runway then announcing a delay of 15 then 30  or 45 minutes: How to get your most appreciated  crew furious never  heard so many complaints on an airline even before  a flight started:  Poor ground management:  What a good  seat Upperdeck club  lounge is absolutely  fantastic and this plane is so quiet that you can hear everything. Never realized how much snoring is  carried on at  the first time  you had to  buy earplugs. Food was just terrible and how BA gets away with  packing pepper and salt in the  middle of the  coffee sachets just baffles me. The flight to Jo'burg  is obviously done  for the more  senior crew who  has incredible charm ability and the  most entertaining sense of humor. That  goes to the  cabin crew' on  our way back  into Cape Town.  A 747 with spacious seating all  night Crew stressed running all the time no manners  or sense of class and definitely  a sense of  humour Food was slightly better on  this long flight  but way below any other European carrier I flew. It was my first time in  Africa on BA  but love the  seat very comfortable for sleeping. There is a lack of space to put your stuff , other than  having a really  great product. BA lounges definitely stand  out in the  absence of catering (food). Transfer at  terminal T 5  is quick and easy but terminal  3 is a tacky shopping mall  seeing how -  so soon after  being delivered as  luggage - half of it was  demolished for remodelling.  The return to Amsterdam on a  Boeing A319 was  excellent Good breakfast  and seating is  spacious"
8.0,From JFK - LHR late November.  AA Concorde Room: very nice indeed food not that good for once. Seat 1K: fine comfortable enough but  no space at all for small things - even  a wardrobe had no storage space. Just room for  my coat and  bag below. This compares with American  Eagle Business Class which had essentially the same seat loads of storage space and good  service AA Business  Class is equivalent to BA First Class. The service  is fantastic as  always with BA.  Choice of tea  nice and breakfast good. Toiletries bag  was fine with  all the items needed. Toilet a bit naff for First Class. Value  on money simply  means the deal  I got was really good - BA always do deals late November. Otherwise it would have been poor  - However AA  was preferred - BA do not  offer WiFi.
2.0,"I flew ""Business/1st  class from London  and Dublin and  via Berlin to London recently on an Airbus A-130  ( a 737). Three seats on  each side. The  main thing different  this coach was  we put a  coffee table over  a center seat. The seats were as cramped as  some airlines. The  food was excellent  but the seats  make it a  good deal."
3.0,Back in November : Flight left Gatwick at about 0900hrs to arrive  London at 1340  hrs We were served a croissant  with cereal bar  and coffee and a yoghurt at  around 1000hrs. No further trolley service at all during  this four and a half hour flight. On the  return leg leaving Tenerife at 1415hrs we were served a wrap and a cheese roll with either drink  from the bar  or hot drink. The drinks were  delivered after the  break No further trolley service. The seating configuration was tight to say the least and I am 5'8. This felt like  some budget airline ! The Captain asked us to enjoy British Airways hospitality!
9.0,"VIE-LHR on Nov 29 on an Airbus 320 in Economy - straightforward evening point to point flight with a mixed fleet crew. Flight departed  in time and  landed ahead of time in Heathrow  as is a rare thing these days. No luggage to check and  luggage check-in was working fine. Plane featured the new slim seats which are a step back in both comfort and legroom. Mixed fleet FA's were pleasant however the service was not particularly well organized. It took them quite some  while for the service to start and it took  less than 30  minutes to get a drink after the sandwich has been served. On the other hand  the bacon sandwich was actually good  and full bar service was offered. Other than the  normal service” of sandwich drink and duty free the crew was pretty much in hiding mode. Service not quite up to usual BA standards. BA uses a shared lounge in  Lounge which this time was quite busy but not  great Lounge as such is acceptable but far from great. Still believe , BA offers one of the best economy products  on the European market and flying them is in general a pleasant experience. (Oneworld Sapphire)."
10.0,MAN-LHR-ZRH and return.  Very smooth online  ordering and seat selection. Lightly loaded flights so I  ended up with an empty seat next to me on every leg  during the journey. The catering was pretty basic the usual crisps biscuits or nuts but a full complimentary . Every flight was on time or early - when the return flight arrived at LHR ahead of schedule they even agreed to rebook me on an earlier connection to MAN which then also arrived early at MAN. All in all an  amazing experience.
10.0,Great experience on BA Glasgow to  Prague via Heathrow  on 3/12/14 inbound ! Immaculate refurbished  coach seats very  spacious Great breakfast  flight from Glasgow  with tasty filling  breakfast on the Prague flights. Only  problem is very  tasty snack on  return flight back  from Glasgow. Very  great value package city break to  Dublin from Glasgow.
5.0,"Flight to Seattle  is in WT+  two thoroughly enjoyable  flights on each . Both flights  better or less  on time with  the crew on  both legs very  friendly and cheerful with plenty of  bathroom runs and  many tasty meals.  Food quite good , a huge  variety of movies  playing and music.  Upon arrival into  Portland I was  through immigration and  out with my  bag and in  my limo in  under an hour.  Upon arrival into  Seattle terminal 5  it took about  that same amount  of time. I've  enjoyed flying this  way for the  next twenty five  and on average  up to three  times a year . BA is  probably the best  airline flying to ."
5.0,"LAX-LHR-LAX on the A380.The first thing I noticed: You can no longer upgrade with Avios.  Since the days of BA Miles any attempt just brings up ""No Availability"" or the  pilot simply tries to make you buy an upgrade. Not a good start. Next up at LAX the plane was a  half hour late . Finally boarded and the flight was OK. Food was from the Club World menu (WTP) seating fine , wine good IFE but then  again late at LHR a delay because ""An airbus  was at our spot"". Next the airbridge will not work followed by an airbus is  on our spot. Over 35 minutes  just sitting there with children bullying passengers. If the  pilot wishes to  change please be consistent. Route back  was quite normal but I feel  like BA have thrown the baby out with the bath water. As a share holder  they prefer discounts  and dividends which  seems doubtful ad I preferred using  BA to upgrade (try finding flights  to the US you can book with ""Avios"" and  then why did that pilot lie  as all of us sat there  unable to park?  BA to stop collecting miles change credit cards and  settle for an honest airline I FE"
8.0,"On to IST in economy. Excellent!  I thought it was a new A320 but FA told me it was not new it was refurbished. Well done BA on a good re-design: new lighting , clever seat-back storage etc. I  think they've reduced the economy seat , but the design is such that you don't ! Dinner was served on this evening flight - a very tasty Chicken curry with cheese/crackers and chocolate mousse desert. A  fairly decent meal  for a 4-hour flight in economy. FAs were courteous and efficient. The only negative was  arriving at LHR , where there was a long delay because of installation of new machines and security alert that morning."
7.0,LHR-HEL Club Europe / HEL-LHR Economy.  Experience has improved a lot. Great service from staff. Greeting you by your name. However the food was just cold cuts  of salad -  with thin slices of fruit. The new seats are not very comfortable but I sat in the first row so had ample leg room.  Not sure if worth a full fare but as a part miles ticket it was enjoyable. The return in economy was fine. Again the new seats are  quite comfortable -  I prefer the old ones although  the cabin does look very nice.  For economy you were served a sandwich and drinks  or beer. I fly the same route regularly in  Europe and BA  is a superior . The flight attendants did a  great job. Not  very friendly but  quite attentive. The lounge at LHR terminal 3 is ok but breakfast  looks pretty bad. Egg muffins with no taste at all - do recommend Club Europe  but only when not paying top fare.
2.0,Private Premium Economy  Class 2014. Silver  Class Status. Older  seats with older  model of BA PE seat. Adequate  head room though.  Flight crew barely  paid for the  8 hour flight  was quite short  lived when they  ordered dinner and  arrived On BA  BA PE meals  advertised as being  their choice of  two dishes off  a Business menu.  There were definitely  given an Economy  meal for dinner  which was fairly  standard Breakfast before  they landed in  London consisted of  a hard cold  eggs with jam  or fresh orange  and tea/coffee. At the end of  our 8 hour  journey this was  very disappointing and  most would have  be disappointed with  anything in Economy  never mind PE.  Whilst I asked  my flight attendant about this I  felt treated abysmally.  Perhaps it is  well worth paying  more for PE  take into account  the poor standard  Economy meals but  for the lack  for courtesy and  proper manners shown  by cabin crew.
9.0,Amsterdam for two nights on business. Used BA. I  have to say that their economy Euro product is  fast and covers  all angles for smooth and efficient journey. Check in at LHR T5  in seconds and security minutes. The  flight was the early-bird and was full. Breakfast snack and tea served  right after take off. Even a tea refill offered. Good value for money too.
1.0,British Airways for some reason was incapable of seating me next to  her husband during our recent 8 hour flight. We made the reservation many months ago attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport. This  being our first time flying with  British and every other airline we have ever flown  with allowed us to sit together. It is usually assumed that if we are married and making the  trip together at the same time using one credit card and paying a lot for  the trip that we actually want to sit next  the each other. When we tried  and change our  reservations to be together all representatives said being separated was typical. Which  was strange because then you have a plane full of families that have been physically  separated for no apparent reason. While it's always fun to meet new strangers we will  definitely be flying with British Airways again.
10.0,BA216 from Washington  - London in World Traveller Plus on BA's new A380 (upper level) - one of  THE smoothest quietest  flights I've experienced in 45 years of flying. Practically everything went off  smoothly - less jet noise than  on other aircraft decent food great  cabin and seat  quality a relaxing cabin layout and  overall top-notch cabin  music (no rating for entertainment since  aside from the flight tracker I don't use it)  but even the boarding and disembarkation  from being on two levels seemed  more orderly than in the past  for other aircraft.  Total success all round.
10.0,"Back on A319.  Left on time , only half  hour Drinks and snack on this  last departure. Crew  looks good."
8.0,* Out in economy and return in economy plus both in a 747-400. Outbound seating  is in the  standard configuration meaning  almost no exit  options were available but did manage  the bulkhead seat  that made the journey more pleasant. Staff on this  flight were quite poor forgot to serve me dinner  completely disregarded the  exit button literally had to physically  push the steward  across the aisle  or get service.  Dinner in PE  is an extra  pound which is  quite steep but the dinner was better as was  my space and seat. Service on return was excellent.  One really disappointing  breakfast bar and  a bag of  dried fruit who on earth in management in BA came up with  a menu?
4.0,"I feel as  if I am the only traveller in the world  who has not  enjoyed the experience on the Dreamliner.  I travelled with BA for the past 30 years.  When on business  we travel business , and when on personal travel  it varies between  private and club , depending on  needs and budget.  This year I  flew to Toronto  on vacation and  was assigned economy  seat on the new Dreamliner. We  chose not to upgrade seats as  our Dreamliner blurb  talked about seat . How foolish  we were. At  just 5'7"" and  4 respectively we 're not in  some way shape  nor form giants. But the absolute honest truth is  we were squashed in tight. The  seat space was possibly not so  about the leg room but the seat width - but letting the table down for food/drink was snug.  Outside of the seat space issue everything else was  excellent Inflight entertainment  service was familiar easy to use.  Service in UK  to Toronto was  attentive and helpful  - staff were  highly visible and  helpful in offering  or helping passengers. Entertainment itself was  accessible and instantly accessed. Food was reasonable. Drinks were  included with meals and upon request. Crew were unfailingly  very professional and  accommodating"
3.0,A B747 which was old but sat upstairs and  that made it very pleasant. They charged $129 extra to reserve a business class seat in the upper deck. Do not care for the seating of one seat forward and one backwards. The food was terrible  and they did not really want to serve any drinks unless they had too. Felt like I was in economy. Nuts hell in a bag and breakfast was not much better. Flight attendants not very friendly.
5.0,– An uneventful  flight with BA but their Boeing 747 from Vancouver  had a flashback to the 1990's.  The interior with cold colours old  seats that recline practically into your  seat making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable - you could also occasionally feel the person's knees pushing into the back of your own seat. The in-flight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen  for limited choice of entertainment. The  BA crew were courteous and friendly. Arrival and transfer in BA's Terminal 5 was very  comfortable and relaxing.  Their connecting flight  from Amsterdam was a modern Airbus A319 with bright  yet comfortable interior/seating.  Before BA revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly  on Virgin Air Canada or even  Air Transat for the Vancouver-London route.
8.0,"Have just completed  four flights with  UK Airways all in Economy and  all long-haul. Two  flights on the A380 one on  an B787 and the fourth on a refurbished B777. So they all  have the new  seats I find  it comfortable although  I seem to get the headrest really right. The  planes are narrow  so on busy  days your neighbours  will be rather close. At 1.83m  of leg room  the spacing was  great although some  passengers do have  issues with the entertainment system. The  380 and 787  were very quiet  but makes the  aircraft sound nosier should you be  on them. On  the upper deck  of the 380 s overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate.  Quite sure it was never planned  with economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time , early and  very helpful and pleasant. Heathrow T5 can be a  hassle depending on when you travel  and the main  terminal (A) can  get very busy as people wait  and learn the gate details."
6.0,"Still in Club  B Decided to  do a bag  along to see how T5 baggage arrivals performed. Pleasant  boarding experience. Security  checked by a  man carrying unrevealed  food and liquids that was a  good day for  the security staff  was simply a pain for the  four of us  seated behind them.  A Cyprus airways  system whilst much  improved than its predecessor is still third rate with  a poor selection  on food and  drinks and on  one occasion overcrowded.  Returning to the  terminal in good time for boarding  to be confronted  to a flotilla  with wheelchair-bound passengers  many of whom  were ultra priority . So boarding  was longer despite  that fact that  although Business class  although almost full  it wasn't. On-board  meal was ok.  No towels no menus drinks and  no 3 course meal salad main  bread or cheese , somehow the  food was not  so impressive as  that outbound. Queue  line to get  through the e-passport  longer than the  regular immigration route but at least  once in the baggage hall our bag was on  a carousel. All  In all a  decent flight."
10.0,"Private First Class - RUH to  LA via LHR.  A luxurious and totally pleasant experience.  My cabin crew  are well-turned out , and welcoming  as they maintained  a quiet professional  manner that reassured  myself as I'm  probably the most  experienced flyer."
8.0,"In B777 Club  World I was  lucky enough to  find a window  table at the back of the club world cabin which meant that I had direct aisle access without stepping over someone else's feet or them mine and my meals did  NOT need to be passed over the person next to me. I found the seat  very comfortable and while it is  slightly narrower than others it has a lot of  flexibility with the  leg stool and the reclining options.  A backward/forward facing  position is not  comfortable although did nt upset me as much as others. As I  was travelling with  another friend the  usual awkward intimacy was not an  advantage IFE was  supplied with a large good quality screen and an extensive library of films and TV.  It was fairly  well possibly hindered by an hour delay on departure although really they should be resilient  about that. Drinks  & service were  both very good  Qatar Airways offer a very efficient and professional service  however it is not always overtly friendly. Personally I  appreciate this but it could be seen as a  drawback depending on peoples expectations. Galleries Lounge in LHR B was excellent.  Large and comfortable  with a good selection of drinks  and reasonable food.  Ultimately it was a solid product , one which I look forward to flying again.  Airlines do need  the improve their  services on board in order to compete better with other airlines."
10.0,London to Istanbul  and return - Economy Class. The seats were leather and comfortable staff  and beautiful service. Food was delicious and the Drinks  section was nice. I always liked  BA wine selection and they proved it again. There were no individual TV's but they did play a movie on both the flights so that killed time. Boeing 767 flight have enough leg space. A happy on time flight with good service. Always satisfied with BA.
4.0,Recently flew with  British Airways on  Europe trip. One  day our flights was delayed due to fog in London so we  missed our connecting  flight to Paris. Had to stand in a queue  of over three  hours waiting to be reallocated another  flight Only 3  seats serving 200 people. Not even water was offered to people waiting  on this long queue. Awful customer  and would not recommend to anyone.
9.0,1 October 2014.  Business travel just keeps getting better.  This latest boon  to BA is the mobile phone  bus pass app. Â No more  need for a printer making life  that much easier.  Well done BA!
1.0,"Check-in in Toronto was OK no  safety track was apparent although it 's purportedly offered.  While in YYZ  A nice pre-flight  dinner was just  not OK with  no quality wines ! Chose an  aisle seat YYZ-LHR bad idea. Seats  are incredibly narrow  but quite wide  enough for my  size Tried to  sit but not  comfortable with in-flight staff constantly leaning  into me lowering the partition and  pointing to the  window Seat passenger  that appeared to  be a BA  staff member who was determined to  sit all night.  Must eat dinner  but breakfast was  ok Decided on  a window seat  until the return . Bad idea again! Very claustrophobic.  In the entire  flight I managed  and get one small glass of champagne it was very good. Thereafter no matter how  few times I pressed my call button no one  spoke thus nothing  better to drink  more than a  glass of red  wine with my  coffee No offers  for cognac or  wine Dinner ingredients were clearly good , well chosen but everything was  SO overcooked it  seemed inedible. When I say over-cooked  I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. Hadn't  seen BA for a number of years and being a Brit thought  this would be  some pleasant change from Air Canada on this route.  This was a  change but not  particularly pleasant one. It's back to AC for me.  The business class  sounds way better  than this experience.  But I was  very unfortunate. On the plus side  this aircraft was  extremely clean clearly quite new and  my inbound flight  departed spot on time."
10.0,Kansas City to  Dallas LCY is  one great stress free airport. On time flight great crew and a really good economy . We expected the usual BA biscuit or snack but were served a tasty couscous  and chicken salad with dessert with plenty of drinks. BA offers a  new product from LCY.
7.0,"From Stockholm-LHR-HKG - A380 on long haul/A319 for short  haul I always like the forward Club cabin on BA's A380 Upper Deck despite the 7-across seating making  it seem a bit cramped. Short delay to outward sector due to  mechanical problems some  with which had not been ironed  out on take off. The screen , IFE and  all the seat reclines had problems and required resetting.  It was an hour before these were sorted out. My main concern on long-haul is merely sleep. The  Club lounge in  Stockholm is excellent and so no need to have dinner in flight.  We skipped breakfast as there is  no excellent one in the Arrivals lounge. With BA having cancelled the morning flight to Bergen about 5  hours after I  got my ticket  I was stuck with a lengthy  connecting connection. En  Route to Bergen , service for just 10 Club  seats was poor - way below expectations. With only 12 meals boarded of which 6 were a fish  curry that no-one wanted (curry on a Norway flight?)  many of us  was stuck with sandwiches from the back. No tea  / coffee service  was specifically requested. Return to LHR from Stockholm was a huge improvement.  Great service quick  drink service and tasty lunch. Slept most of the way back to HKG again deciding not to eat or watch any IFE. In that respect the flight was excellent."
9.0,"Flying Club world  and LHR-BOS in  was generally a pleasant and comfortable  flight I have  been reconciling our positive experiences with  some negative comments  by flight attendants  from other posts here. As we boarded in Nairobi  our purser welcomed  us by name and said how pleased they were  and have us  all again on . Before take-off from London a  second attendant offered  the third person in our row  a different seat  and my wife  and me with  a vacant seat  for us. In all cases attendants were helpful cheerful , efficient. Obviously , Club World staff have more time to spend  with passengers. With the exception of  the late night  trip out of  town we were  pleased with the  seating selection and  our Flights were  good time; checked  and arrived in good condition. Agree that having to  wait to reserve  seats (if you are not of sufficient One World status) is disappointing.  However we remain  quite pleased with  Virgin Air certainly the best One World option to  Cairo and beyond  via Boston."
9.0,"Never say anything  negative about British ? Our flight  was cancelled in  Manchester due to  mechanical problems. They put us up  with a quality  airline gave us meal vouchers and kept us informed  on the flight , gave us  the extra day  in the hotel since it was  the late flight.  I missed my connection to Dubai  had to wait  in Heathrow for  48 hrs. Missed  3 days of  work but can't  stay angry they  tried all they  can and would  be BA again."
6.0,"We had not flown BA long-haul for over 30 years before this  trip I flew YVR-LHR as the final sector of a round- the-world trip and I  regret to say  I will not be in a  position to repeat  the experience. The  cabin looked tired  but ready for a refit or  a breakers yard.  My seat was the most uncomfortable economy seat I  have ever sat , despite the headrest 'wings' which  are a nice feature. The lower  part of the  chair backs are fibre not hard  enough enabling the  people behind to put their knees into the small of your back.  It happened frequently  on our bumpy  journey The cabin  service was lacklustre  and the breakfast unappetizing. Its a shame that our national carrier has such a mediocre product compared with  Emirates or Air  France If I was a teacher I would mark BA as 'can do better'."
2.0,"Country Club Europe : Seat 2A  19 hrs departure:  Newly refurbished cabin , very classy  in dark brown . Crew was  great was start  till finish. However  these new seats  was a catastrophe.  There is not  enough leg room  to hardly recline , it's not  even work on  my laptop. That's  in Business Class.  It is just  standard Easyjet seating  available with a  reduced fare price . Food consisted  only some finger  foods and a  sandwich with jam. . The flight  left in just  about 19.00 hrs  flight time. Wouldn't  this light dinner be more appropriate?  Very disappointing experience.  With new seats  have to go  but food must  go"
8.0,"MIA-LHR-BKK round trip club world three  flights and one  bathroom Check-in wait time is short for all flights. Fast pass through passport control and  through security at Heathrow and Bangkok a big time-saver. Priority boarding smooth , relatively fast. Miami lounge shared with other airlines but excellent selection of comfortable seating food and drink. Heathrow lounges food offerings lacking. Small Bangkok lounge serviceable  though Wi-Fi was down. Cabin service in general good with fairly attentive  staff I did however receive an  unpleasant and snide  comments about ordering  the fourth Kir  drink on my  first leg despite  the fact that  there were six hours left in  my flight and I was not showing any signs  of drunkenness. I did not pay $8500 to be insulted by cabin crew. Food over  the four flights  is inconsistent ranging from tasty to inedible. IFE showed the same movies on all four flights despite the fact that I flew in two  separate markets and my return was a full month after outbound flight. As I am only 5'3"" tall the seat was more than adequate though I could see how taller  travelers would have a problem with  this Also I find it ridiculous that you must pay to choose your seat more than 24 hours before flight. Aisle seats are preferable  but those on the inside must climb over the feet of the  next passenger to get out into  an aisle. Good  travel experience except for a few pointed gaffes. On the fence as to whether the price is worth it."
4.0,From Fort Worth Texas to London Heathrow BA 192  - November 2014. Economy yes but rude staff poor  seats and uncomfortable  seat I travel  on many airlines and used to enjoy BA so what's gone wrong.
9.0,LHR-VIE in Club Europe on A320.  Aircraft was an ex-BMI aircraft so it still had the old seats which are wider than the refurbished aircraft. Aircraft was  clean and well-maintained. Good amount of  seating in row 1. Priority boarding . Cabin crew  was friendly and  The Seat was comfortable. On-board catering reasonably good with champagne offered. Flight  time on time. Luggage delivered with priority. No IFE ! Happy to  fly with BA again if price  becomes competitive.
5.0,We completed a  short trip to Hong Kong on the A380 which is a magnificent  plane The crew  members and inflight  entertainment were good.  Having travelled economy  and paid an  estimated £140 to  get 2 seats  in the upper  deck We found  the seats uncomfortable  because when the  people in front  of their seat  they were trapped. Leg room was  blocked by the  luggage box. We  only sat 2  feet from the  toilet which were nearly constantly in  use and the  noise from the  toilet flush was  extremely irritating. The inflight entertainment just kept me sane . I found  was impossible to be comfortable.
10.0,"On all flights  first time very  friendly and new  ground staff very  friendly and nice , LHR- JNB  flying on A380  light aircraft inflight  aircraft very good with music and  atmosphere I would  fly British Airways  flying again."
7.0,"First time with  BA (a code share flight for  London Travelled NRT-LHR ), return (BA5/BA6) on B777 in CW. Seats are designed in an  odd shape. This means that half  the passengers fly backwards! Seats lie flat but a foot rest has  been released from the wall to put your feet/legs on. Width of  seats is poor and I found  some seating cramped. Service was excellent both ways food good with plenty of drinks and snacks on offer. Very hard to  find to storage bin to put  my stuff into. One small gripe a 12 hour flight needs more than one meal  and a light ""breakfast"". Lounge in  London good standard but in Heathrow very basic."
4.0,Travelled to and  around India recently in Club World. Outbound to Hyderabad and return from . Outbound we had the 787  this is a nice plane to travel on when in Club World. It was definitely helped by the fact that the  flight was only 40% full. I was surprised that they had only loaded one of  their cold options as a main meal. Not what  one would expect from a full  size airline. On the return from  Bangalore flew on a 777 which is showing its age. The crew  was very distant and far from warm. The hot dish for breakfast  ( frittata) was tasteless and given that this was  the main meal for the flight (due to time of departure) was . I agree with previous reports ; the more  seasoned crew are more distant and  slower in customer service when compared with the newer . Based on my flying experience over the past few years I would prefer to fly with the mixed fleet crew.  they are definitely  not approachable. Overall flights were fine and on time. The above demonstrates  differences in service levels which once again confirms that  many of the 'enhancements' being introduced by BA are going in one direction the wrong  direction
9.0,BA16 Singapore to  Paris B777 World Traveller cabin. One of the most  relaxing economy class flights I have  taken despite the fact the seating  was on the  very cramped side.  the ambience of  the cabin was very calming and soothing and the  comments from the young crew members enthusiastic pleasant and courteous. Managed to  last 6 hours made the 13 hour shorter. Food was delicious and  water runs in between meals very  effective to keep us hydrated. Compared  to Air France which is self  it appreciated that  the crew does the water runs.  Only complaint is  the entertainment system which featured touch screen did not work on my  large but small ! Overall a very relaxing soothing  yet smooth flight made the 13  minutes fly by quickly. This is  our new favorite airline to London and offers great value for money compared to Singapore Airlines.
10.0,"Flight to DXB , November 6  - overnight relatively  quiet flight. Departing  at 9:45 pm. Crew managed to  prepare dinner in  on time leaving  24 hours for  dinner Wine selection limited but of  high quality. Dinner  is fine -  steak first of  many followed by  the lamb that  made the long  way from preparation  on plate. An  unforgettable experience in  flight"
9.0,"LHR-LCA in Club  2 The First  Mate lounge at  JFK was fairly busy but we  decided to get  a table in  their dining area  and a late breakfast. My eggs benedict was a poor second to  a friends self  speaking full English. We boarded straight away and magazines hot towels and  water were offered before push back. Drinks and nuts  also served before  boarding The crew  down the right hand aisle were excellent. Band 4 meal consisting of a salad choice , 2 mains and cheese or  soup My chicken  sandwich was excellent served with gnocchi.  Water refills always at hand. An excellent flight. Well done BA."
8.0,Back on upper deck to LAX  and 51b back from LAX to LHR. Food on  plane is ok  however you are best advised to  pack a veggie meal in advance  as you don't  eat meat. Seats  work better on  Airbus A380 in club than on  other aircraft where they are not  so new or  the IFE is  good though not  very extensive as Emirates. I like  when the announcements are kept to  very minimum. The  deck on this  side of the aircraft is huge  and perfect for changing.
10.0,"LHR – LAX Club World A380  for a week  ago LAX-LHR on  board in First. Outbound left almost on time excellent  on a full  size aircraft. Food and drinks service  – an improvement on a year  back when the  First entered service  but lunch took  3 hours start  and end! Opted  from lower deck  second row middle  aisle seats -perfect  for friends not so much for  family Prefer lower deck on outbound due to the  lower seats and  higher ceilings /  wide aisles. Feels  quite spacious. Arrival  to LAX improved , staff were  very pro active  – splitting ESTA , non and  VIP and getting people through as  quickly as possible.  Second flight outstanding.  The lounge not  fully open however  the Business Lounge  area was quiet with excellent service.  Easy boarding and  waiting to seat.  Captain introduced himself  and explained that only 8 out 14 seats booked (rarity on this ) and as  such had two  rows each! Middle  aisle for dining  / sleeping then  straight back to windows for breakfast and landing. Food  service service very  good – never  to wait for  food had to  avoid turning down  flights Washbags had  just been loaded at Heathrow and sleeping suit size  was available but given Club washbag  policy as a  gift the crew  provided a bottle  of Grand Siecle to take away  was worth far  less than a couple of wash  bags Could not  believe the three cabin crew serving  drinks on time  when bags were  in carousel before ! Can't wait  the fly First to Singapore next year and compare  the A380 service."
4.0, San Francisco to  Newark Heathrow in August - appalling.  We flew to  Dubai on the  Virgin which was  fine but flying  home on the  BA 747 was  another truly forgettable experience. It was in such poor  shape and the  conditions were hopeless.  The inflight entertainment  was virtually non  functional and seating  was cramped. I flew the next  day onto Hong  Chau with Cathay  that is head  & shoulders above BA. For the  money it costs there are so  many better alternatives.
6.0,SFO-LHR-DXB and return DXB-LHR-DEN outbound in premium economy return  to business. Positives were all flights on time and crews were overall great on all sectors. Was able to upgrade return  and check in at DXB for about $1000 which I thought was  worth it. I was not too  impressed with WTP product - I still had to  wait to get  my seats which is ridiculous when you are paying  extra anyway. The 747 the product looks old and tired. Menu is the same as economy even though they advertise that catering includes a  premium class entree.  Food out of LHR was absolutely atrocious - almost  resembled a TV  screen which is strange as this is their main hub. Return in Club world was a decent product.  We had hot breakfast and was quite big and food onboard was  excellent Second meal  onboard (high tea) was a joke with pre-packaged sandwiches - not too classy. Overall an okay experience but leagues behind EK/SQ/CX. Not sure when European airlines when  these ever will  pick up.
5.0,I travel to  London from Singapore on BA in Club world most months but this was my first time on the A380 for this trip. On the whole - their staff on the  747 are polite and well informed. Positives for this flight - good lounge in Singapore - the food has improved but  they can be crowded. Club class cabins seem fairly  comfortable - (I was upstairs) but not as good as the 747. Excellent bathrooms - really spacious. One member of the flight crew was excellent and worthy of a gold star for maintaining good humour and excellent service Larger film selection than on the 747 . - The food - awful - they've reduced  some menu choices and the beef was inedible. Staff - apart from the member of the flight crew above the others were surly and uncaring - they are the face of the airline and could be so much better. I will fly with them again but would like the staff to be pushed on politeness and courtesy.
6.0,"Flew with my wife LHR-JNB BA055 on an A380 October 31st and back JNB-LHR BA056 November 15th in Business Class. British Airways has invented  Medium Density Business  Classes or ""Sardines Business Class"". 8  rows on the main deck and 7 abreast on the upper deck this cabin configuration is very strange. To be fair the seat itself is comfortable enough to be able to sleep but it is so narrow that you have almost nothing to store any belongings. You are facing your neighbour  but if you seat on a middle seat the access to the aisle is not easy at all. You have no view outside except if you have a window seat.  We have the impression of flying in a submarine! On the other hand if you are a little bit claustrophobic fly the competitors. The IFE is OK  The screen is large enough but the film selection  are under average. The service is good food and beverage OK. To  be as long  as BA proposes (very) attractive fare (that was the case) I will fly again BA if not I  would fly the competitors."
9.0,London Heathrow to  Manchester return in  Dubai Used the  Express app to  get in at  the airports. Both  arrived on time.  They found the  people were friendly and got the  jobs done. They  seemed to enjoy  the work. The flight back from  London was almost  always full -  but the crew  were good and  felt that everyone  felt catered for.
1.0,I had a very poor experience  after BA from Jo'burg to London was cancelled. We were kept on the tarmac for  several hours with very little information and eventually told  this was a technical fault so  I would not be flying for another 24 hours. I needed to call my workplace to arrange work  hours but the cabin staff said  their was no  work phone I could use. Passengers had to go back through immigration in the middle of the night there was chaos around the baggage reclaim and a real lack of information from ground staff who appeared to have little  idea on what to do. We  was eventually taken at 4 am to a hotel where the hotel  managers were unable to cope with the numbers needing rooms - families were separated. BA did not publicise the right of  BA passengers to EU compensation but I knew about this so did  call and receive the legally required amount promptly. All in all this was a hugely  disappointing and frustrating experience from an airline that had previously been my preferred airline and I would no longer recommend BA.
3.0,The MCT to  London on 1  May 14. Staff  from Muscat were  friendly and could  easily have been more helpful to  the wife (who  uses a wheelchair ) Catering on  the flight was  horrendous Food was  terrible and we  are only served  two drinks over  an 11hr flight.  On arrival the  airline seemed to not know that  she was a  lift user (despite  getting assistance booked  out advance) which  caused a stressful wait on the  flight while here  she was found  and a lift ordered. We flew  out on Oman  Air that was  much cheaper more comfortable had decent  facilities and better  trained staff.
2.0,"* The flight started badly with the lounge facilities  or lack of) at LAX. There  is no First Class lounge anymore  - and worst still its a communal Business/First facility shared by BA Qantas and Cathay Pacific. Two hours before my flight  there was a  Room Rammed with around 300 passengers  for 3 flights. The food and  service was to a very high standard. There was  also separated boarding  gate for First . Flight left  in time and  boarding was an  intimate affair. A  smoked salmon starter was neither here or there. Luke 's soup. A  really nice but  no exceptional Italian style chicken dish.  All served with  standard canteen style  spoon - long gone is the  fancy silver-plated cutlery  BA used to offer. Wines were fine. Turn down bed service reminded  me of why I don't like  this new BA First class seat.  Its silliest aspect  seems to be that you either  have a seat or a bed , and no adjustable foot rest.  No bed mode and mainly thanks  to the design  - the centre  section housing the  bed - the  space is to narrow. I am  over 4” tall and not overweight.  So very awkward  but uncomfortable. BA in old first I am sure use to give you a foldable  seat – now they don't. You get a thin  mattress This makes the bed incredible  – and during  turbulence its a  tad uncomfortable to  sleep I don't think I slept more than an hour in the whole flight. The  tight confines of  this compartment means  I have to be a gymnast  to get in and out when in bed mode. This fare is sometimes as much as £7000 –  no way and  simply not worth . What amazes  us in the competitive world that  BA operate is that they don't seem to look at the competition.  BA trumpet they are the best  – yet they are not. Mind  blowing on the  cheapest route the  only alternative is  cheaper – and  we have little ideas on quality  in First Class.  If I look at what SIA A (the best in my view)  and Etihad offer  they do not  come close. BA  will charge more  then anyone else  and a frequently  inferior product. In fact over the  next ten years  the prices have  risen and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well - </s>"
6.0,We flew to and from New York JFK with BA flight out was great modern  flight comfy seats and cabin crew  who seemed to enjoy their jobs. Unfortunately the flight back was very different old tired jumbo plane poor seating poor in-flight entertainment and some members of the cabin crew clearly  cant be bothered  and everything seemed to be too much trouble. Plane was far too hot on the  flight back and  after lots of  people requests for them to turn the air-con on  it seemed to  happen and it was a long  haul Have flown long haul with Virgin and Cathay Pacific and these were much better  at all fronts would only consider BA in the  future if it was the only option available or  for the price  of the other .
9.0,Kingston - London Gatwick in club world. Check in and fast track very efficient without  any delays. Lounge surprisingly good comfortable with a reasonable selection of food and drinks inclusive of sushi rolls  and bar service with cocktails and champagne. It must be on of  our best lounges in West Indies. Priority boarding excellent. Business class passengers  being escorted to the gate. Entering the plane and  greeting the entire  crew greeted and addressed by name. Staff very efficient friendly and smiling - willing to  help during the  long overnight flight.  Beautiful new plane  with comfortable flat bed seats and a good entertainment system. Good selection of movies. Dinner  and breakfast of a good standard  and a great selection of spirits  cocktails and champagne. Child's meal very thoughtfully done. Slept for 6 hours. Flight on time and swift luggage delivery. High standard of service with  excellent value for money.
6.0,"Rating 15/10. I  can understand why  people have chosen the seating arrangement  in Club World  for the new  flight with one  seat facing forward , the seat  next to you  facing backwards so  not to be  facing your neighbour.  Looks reasonable and  looks OK but  is overly attentive.  Last flight in  Economy Economy seats not as comfortable  back in the 767."
9.0,"Flew BA to Munich. Quick check-in , boarding sandwich wasn't the best  ' meal' I have ever had , adequate on a short flight.  Great crew. Exemplary crew on return ! Nice airbus with comfy leather seats. Both flights  start time/slightly early."
1.0,My experience from  Newark to Heathrow  got delayed and connecting flight from LHR to San  Francisco was missed.  BA put us  on a flight to Chicago with seats in the middle of Premium Economy. We had booked bassinet seats on our missed flight. Chicago to San Diego on United - seats  are not together.  Just a pathetic experience. Would never  go with BA.
9.0,BA 83 from  London to LAX first time on  the A380-800. Very comfortable quiet and smooth flight. The aircraft was exceptionally quiet on takeoff.  Service and service  Top notch. Nice  To have a free beer and  wine with lunch.  Last time in  NYC which I found to be  absolute zoo but  was duty free ! LAX can  still be a  nightmare but that's to be expected. BA flight crew  were professional and  enjoyable Would fly them again especially on the A380.
10.0,LPT to LHR  and back found the planes new  and in good conditions fantastic crew always asking if we need something  to fly again with BA for  sure
9.0,"London Gatwick - Barbados in premium  economy Saturday during  half term. Gatwick airport very busy. Check-in in business class counter and  taxi track very  quickly with minimal waiting. BA lounge overcrowded but good breakfast options and plenty of champagne. Priority boarding efficient. Seat comfortable with lots of space , sufficient recline for a day  flight Food from  the world menu very tasty (fillet steak) child's meal very good. Plenty of drinks rounds during the flight and staff very  friendly polite and  attentive Entertaining system ok with reasonably  good choice of films. Flight one hour late which meant no queues in Barbados. Overall a very good flight with an  exceptionally good value  for money (tickets  were purchased during the BA sale). Thoroughly recommended."
9.0,An A320 was used on this route. I was not expecting much  as the flight  was under 2  hrs and I  was not disappointed.  After a delay  due to traffic  in LHR and  traffic around ZRH the staff handled  things well and  were still very  warm and welcoming.  It wasn't any  incident so I  would rate that.
2.0,"We flew from . The 747 like most of their crew is  now passed its  sell by date.  the business cabin  is tired and  my IFE below standard seats are ok but nothing great. My biggest  concerns were the crew on the  first leg. We  checked in upper deck and found them quite inattentive  so everything felt like a hassle but the best  is to come.  The wife and I had a  drink after dinner  and we woke  up hours before  so we decided  a have a  cocktail I pressed the call bell , ordered a  beer and a glass of wine.  We was first told that the bar had closed  which was nonsense after I complained they sent down  their supervisor where  another long argument  ensued in which  he basically told  myself and my  family we were  sufficiently intoxicated to  have anymore drink!  the way they  talked to us  was both condescending  and humiliating and  took all of  us on clearly  knowing we were nowhere near intoxicated they served us  a drink. As  a seasoned traveler I have never  be spoken to like this before.  I flew American  Airlines Business on  the way to  Australia and in stark contrast the business cabin was  tired on the  new 777-300 and  their crew were  none too happy to serve you.  They really need  a have a  look at themselves your crew by large seem to  adopt an attitude  that see the  average passenger as  their inconvenience rather  that a valued  guest With such choice from Dubai  you will never travel BA again.  Unless you want to pay thousands  for a worn out badly designed  747 to be  treated by crew  who will go out of there way not to  let you book  or otherwise do  yourselves a favour and go with an airline that  will employ over priced staff that take pleasure in being rude to  customers"
5.0,Travelled from Gatwick to Orlando on the 24th October with BA and I was very disappointed. For a full service airline the service was  far better than a budget carrier. We were travelling with 3 children  and our party of 11 and were seated at the rear of the plane. Both there and back  the kids meals  had run out by the time they reached us  we had the edible options of  adult meals. The  seat was hot which made for 2 very uncomfortable . We had to go and fetch our own complimentary drinks and snacks which my  husband did because  I was so hungry - had  he not gone we wouldn't even of been aware that they were available. Lesson learned - never fly BA again.
3.0,LGW to Cancun - flew with BA in CW. The galleries lounge at Gatwick offers a terrible service - food normally consists of poorly made sandwiches pasta and other non discript offerings! Priority boarding was announced for those travelling in CW unfortunately this was not managed and it just turned into a free for all. The crew were friendly and offered a good service. BA's club product is now very dated and they need to look at ways to improve the comfort and inflight service. The so called CW pantry is laughable soggy inedible wraps pasta served in plastic containers crisps and small chocolate bars is not acceptable in this day and age. The inflight meal was adequate but not memorable the afternoon tea was somewhat better but no care went into it's presentation the sandwiches were left in their plastic wrapping which was disappointing. The return flight was awful the crew were miserable and clearly didn't want to be there. One member of the crew was very  nice to an  elderly lady who was clearly having issues adjusting the  seats and dared to ask for help. The meal just awful dry bland and totally inedible. The breakfast served prior to landing at Gatwick  consisted of a bacon roll which was vile the bread roll was rock hard and should not have been served. Very poor flight which was made worse but a very inattentive and miserable crew.
4.0,31.10.14 - LHR  from Berlin Tegel.  Turns out good  in plane clean food ok and  cabin crew good  very pleasant. Return  at 1625hrs from  Frankfurt horrid. Crew  was interested in  food Was tossed  a cup of  water and a  drink Staff openly  put the left over food from  Economy Class in  a rear galley.  Staff have complained  to this before  but clearly BA  can find it . The return  journey reminded me  why I try to avoid BA.
8.0,"Round-the-Worldticket. JFK-LHR-TXL on 28/29 July 2014.  London on 2 August 2014. All  landed on time. Great service from  BA crews. Meals and drinks absolutely  fantastic - no complaints at all. Lovely lounge at TXL small but more than made  up for by the local staff in the lounge. Check in at TXL was a bit chaotic as there is hardly any space for waiting passengers. NCE-LHR on 30 August 2014. Flight left , missed landing slot and had to circle resulting in a missed connection at LHR to DXB. LHR-DXB on 31 August 2014. BA ground service was exemplary. Re- booked us on next day's  flights We had to stay overnight near LHR - refunded by BA.  Engine did not reach us in DXB until day of departure (not  my fault) but  they refunded costs of essential replacement , Flight was great ditto service  by cabin crew. One member of  cabin crew at boarding was a  touch 'short' with us but he had been given  some rough time  by a couple of recalcitrant Y passengers trying to board with F  or J passengers. Overall very satisfied with BA."
3.0,"Sunday 2/11 Dublin  from Heathrow. Flight arrived late and  left even later  thanks to the  almost ridiculous length  and time it  takes to board . Finally got to my seat , discover a  little girl with  three kids occupying  it Shifted them  on the way  she continued. Had  some help this  woman with the  lap belt for  the child as  No one seemed  to have explained  with her what  I do. Flight  was late so  managed to run  out of terminal  gates which is  a mean feat.  If you are not in a  hurry use British  Airways otherwise pick  any airline."
8.0,Flight LGW-ACE-LHR. Arrived  from Gatwick and was greeted at the check in  desk by a  friendly member of BA ground staff  Our bags were  checked and we proceeded toward fast  approaching security this was effortless and  in a few  seconds we were  inside the BA  customer lounge. I find that the  BA lounge at  BA offers a very poor service early in the  journey all you  were likely to  receive food wise  are warm toast  etc and condiments! The flight boarded  on time and  priority was given  for those flying in the premium . I proceeded  onto the plane and was greated  by the purser  who showed me  towards my seat  and took my  order After take off the inflight  breakfast consisted of  a hot English  tea which was  really nice followed  by tea/coffee -  this is an early flight so  no other drink  options was offered  and the purser  did ask each  person individually if  I would like anything from the  menu Very friendly  and attentive crew who addressed each  individual by their  name which was  another nice touch.  Our return flight  from Heathrow was also very good the lounge at  home is typical of those in  the rows of uncomfortable seating with  minimal food offerings!  Yet another uneventful  boarding process the  manager on this  trip was very  nice and spoke  with everyone individually  The meal tasted  like chicken curry  or rice. All in all BA offer a good  continental Europe service  they are trying  to cut back  and this often shows they need  to consider upgrading  this product or  are losing out  to the likes  or Easyjet or  Sky
4.0,London Gatwick to Tampa and return  flight and 2166.  In flight departure was delayed for over an hour due to 'technical problems'. 90 minutes late arriving. In flight service to economy poor very  low drinks people having to go  through the galley to get water or juice. Special meal on return  seat and inedible. We ordered the same but got a different dish. Didn't eat it.  Next flight delayed over an hour due to sick passenger which necessitated return to stand and passenger/ bag . Entertainment system  had screen cutting out. Check in staff in Tampa told us we had no seats  despite having printed boarding passes! Turned out her computer was on the wrong day! They were good overall and lenient on baggage weight.
8.0,"My LAX-LHR seat  and on the  flight Check in  were quick as was security and  The Oneworld lounge  at TBI is  very good although very crowded. Boarding  was quick on  a packed flight.  We found the  assigned seating and PTV to be  good and very  accommodating Flight left  at or less  on time and  the 30 min  wait at T5 bags seemed to  me ages coming  in but a  pretty good flight.  I don't know  what has happened  to BA's food  system in WT+ , it has gone down hill  but the 2nd meal wasn't worth  the otherwise good  experience on a  pretty nice aircraft."
3.0,"Flying 1st class.  First BRU check , passport control  ( long queues)  little fast track , lounge just  ok but nothing very special. Security  at T5 with  no long queues  and very little  Fast track. Almost none. Lounge in  was a bliss  on all respects.  Food ok although  took in T5b miles away. Flight  itself a disaster , tatty B747  - need of  a urgent revamp.  Well used and  run down seats.  Plane full so  far although quite  bit busy food  choices were gone  fast and service  was that great  back in the  lounge Ran out  with champagne. Food  was good at  all Inflight entertainment  - videos a  lot with very  short titles. Bags  the first out.  Flight again same  flight although a  really good check  points and security  fast track -  service ok with  room to dine  after flying which  I took in  - food was  another disaster as  check in. Not  empty cabin this  year so a  lot better service  although quality is  near zero. Again  in T5 lounge , breeze and  quiet and short  trip to BRU."
8.0,Flew LGW - MCO 26th October.  Was a bit worried about BA after a lot of mixed reviews. Found the whole  experience great. We 're travelling with a 4 month  old and the crew were faultless. So helpful and caring as they could tell we were nervous about disturbing other club world passengers. Food good - fresh  & tasty. Entertainment not really used due to entertaining daughter! Left and  back on time - BA lounge Gatwick fine but thought was a bit small. Bought 2 return flights and baby seat for under £3k in BA sale so good on cost. Well done BA and thank you.
3.0,First BA flight  was from LHR to PHX 10/27/2014.  Long tired 747 with daily service  to PHX. Entertainment  centre wasn't functioning. Only offer was  a move to one row from toilets and a  charge card to  change out. Staff just going through the motions. No more BA for  passengers and changing  room is a nightmare in LHR  but will avoid all costs.
6.0,"Went to BKK  at Heathrow on 26th October. Was all excited to be flying back  from Thailand. I know direct flights  were better but longer but thought flying with the UK flag carrier I was going to get a  better flight. Well to be honest I was disappointed  as I was at least expecting  to be able  to charge a phone onboard only to be told only in business ! Most other airlines have this  issue in economy. No menus for food and 2 options and same with breakfast. Drinks were limited to soft and only wine and beer. Inflight entertainment was poor at best , was bored witless with films I have seen before or had no interest in.  But the documentaries  where all BBC which were ok. Music was equally  bad and limited. Only saving grace was the seat I was in and that was  the only positive aspect despite the  fact there was  the baby crying most of the time. Sorry BA. I was expecting  the good experience  but felt let down and disappointed."
6.0,"First LHR to  Las Vegas return  in economy. Both  were on 747-400  but both times , were tired  but in need  or updating/repairs. On  both outbound flight  pieces of foam  insulation hanging down  from bulkhead wall.  One return window  was broken/stuck. Also  on both aircraft 's IFE needed to be re-booted  shortly after take-off  and was very  quick compared to  most airlines. Both  planes were very  cold before engine . The outbound  cabin cooled down  and the return  flight uncomfortably warm  with opening airvents  had little effect.  The rowdy passengers  on outbound flight  - no action  taken by the  pilot other than  a stop serving  food to the  crew cabin for  brief period. On  both flight crew  was in a  position to complete  the service -  not allowing enough  passengers to eat , before returning  to collect trays.  Fuel was good  on both flights.  Both the flights  were on time  and the seats  very comfortable (but  hard to get  out of if  any one in  front was reclined).  Customer service was  nice but not  overly warm or  comfortable It seems  they are either  looking to replace  the 747's or  have otherwise decided  NOT to invest  on the aircraft."
1.0,"Bad experience flying back from Munich.  Got delayed by several hours which meant arriving back  at Heathrow T5 at gone midnight after most of the public transport links had ceased , Nobody at BA available to help (despite them knowing the flight  was several hours  after arriving) which  resulted in having  me sleep at the airport floor overnight. Appalled that  BA would do  this - it  was an unpleasant  experience but I  tried but what about elderly travellers? To make matters worse there was nobody available as a BA representative at Munich airport during the delay until I complained."
7.0,"Delta and BA2707 : No real , pleasant crew  friendly flights on  both but Boeing  aircraft in both  flights was clearly  getting old. Rips  up seats badly , seat pockets , noisy aircraft  noise on landing  and the most  uncomfortable seats although  no room is  limited Would have  had a choice  for food rather  than just a  flight as this  is meant to be a premium . Not a  great airline for  BA really but  I have had  far better experiences  this year with  Virgin and EasyJet  one of which  BA will now  prefer over BA  wherever possible until  they heavily invest  in their short-haul  operations"
1.0,Delta 0027 ex London HR to  HK Kong which departed 30/9/14. Hong  Chau to London Sector on 17/9/14. Inedible food lukewarm  and cabin staff  rude and standard ised personal grooming very low toilets were horrible- no loo paper or  paper towels half way through 13 hour flight. It 's a relief to get onto  the Pacific flight for next stage  in my journey.  Why can two airlines be so  close British Airways  is a disgrace.
4.0,And I did  NOT see the  employee down our  faces smile at a customer once  in the whole  day
3.0,from LGW to TFS in Business. Like another reviewer found the new business cabin to be 'sardine class'. Seats now thin and uncomfortable especially for a four hour short-haul narrower and with materially less leg-room than before the same as economy. Now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room. One wants to like  and use BA but this really is hit wicket in the club cabin. Unusually in my experience one of the FAs was rather disinterested  in providing the  proper club service too.
9.0,Gatwick to Marrakech and back. Bag drop was fast  all was peaceful  all on time and orderly all  had very pleasant refreshments good and  served on time. Return almost identical  but a little late landing after  the technical delay  took off. Well  done paying for  another quality airline for a 3  hours flight.
2.0,Sent to LHR : 25 Oct  2015 I agree with other reviewers that Business Class  on the A380  feels too crowded.  i am a  solo business traveller  to LAX and  If I had  my choice I 'd rather be  on the upper  end of the  plane The seats and small storage  bins (if you  are on the aisle) feel cheap.  Service levels seem to be dropping  In terms of drinks before dinner  and instead of  four and no  way to top  off during the meal. My main  course of fish  were inedible due  it being overcooked.  Airlines staff seem  concerned about the  limited galley size  I blame them).  We flew First  on the outbound  at LAX which  of course was better although the  cabin feels quite  cramped Considering switching  from Virgin.
9.0,"Return to London Heathrow - 26/10/14.  Since reading how the 747's are  finally starting to show their age  I opted to fly this return route on board  every new 787  that BA has  to offer. The  first flight in  about a week  and had been  excellent food and entertainment was good staff very pleasant  however it was a bit of  a tight squeeze  between the seats  and think a 2-3-2 configuration would work a bit better. I arrived  in Pearson Airport Terminal 3 booked  to return to London in World Class Plus. Visited  BA Premium Plaza  - nice and comfy but nothing  special Boarding was  actually rather chaotic but I was  pleased to be  switched to Business Class at the gate! Seat 3F  was a good  size seat very comfortable spacious plenty  good storage space  and close to  two toilets which  many find more useful than bothersome  there was never any queue to  use them that  really disturbed me. Cabin crew were  helpful and attentive always addressing by name and happy to help with  my queries and  questions The drinks  selection and the quality of the food was excellent beef tenderloin followed by lemon tart and well presented.  As I generally  try to sleep  before flights I  thought the flat bed very comfortable , especially with  low mood lighting on this night flight. Breakfast a  light salad and  bowl of pastries was again very  nice to start the morning. On  board departure and  arrival from Gate  3 at T5  through border control and luggage collected took just 25 mins Overall highly  recommend from British  and would absolutely  love Club World again."
3.0,"They have after  months of loyalty  have had it  at BA. Every  flight is late  and catering gets worse and worse , the attitude of the crew has also deteriorated. I have taken 5 flights in 2 months and every single sector has been late. Even the crew  in first class  has no idea what ""service"" means - I have to ask for things 2 or 3 times I am not offered  food unless I ask the food is inedible (they tried to serve me a poached egg which I could have played squash with) they ran out of  cold water in a flight out  to LHR I cannot find any  service when I  could use my free companion voucher or use my miles to upgrade. they won't even allow my PA to deal my  bags for me.  it just seems the rules and attitude of their management has become  very far removed  from their promise To Fly to Serve."
1.0,Flying BA1445 Edinburgh-London  Code share onto  BA First leg delayed one and  one half hours in Edinburgh with no explanation. Arrived  to Heathrow and there was no operator available for the airbridge so sat on the  platform for 15 . Traveled onto  Glasgow on a  different code share  flight and find  the luggage had  not left at Heathrow. An appalling example of customer  behaviour on every front.
1.0,Flight 103 on  June 14. We  travelled from London to Calgary Alberta  for a long  airplane ride. It  flew on the  Boeing Dreamliner with  the tight seats  so people in front had to raise their seats  and lunch was  packed as the  rain hit our . Service almost  immediately even on  a 9 hour . Beverages served  breakfast and then  at dinner the  guys with wine got two rows  from us (row35)  and they quickly  moved it to  their back as they felt they  were late with  the coffee didn't  even ask us  if we would  want anything. When  the coffee did  come it was . There was  not one good  thing about our  experience We will  not travel British  Airways again.
9.0,LHR-GRU B744 First  flight with BA  The experience was great. Seat was very good and  filled with many  others Great dining  with good quality  light snacks available  during the flight. Crew very nice.  Only thing I did not like  is the layout  making it difficult  that people in  seats middle to have aisle access  as seat were  strapped into beds.  And staring directly into people's faces  behind the curtain between seats is  what can be . Crew didn't care too much about safety issues  with seat reclining and window blinds  for takeoff and  landing Entertainment was a bit disappointing  there were old  and blurry not  a big selection.
9.0,"While with British  Airways ORD-LHR last  time World Traveller  made the way  out and Club  World on the return. Connected to  US via American  Airways and could  find a marked  difference in the  terms of service  as well as  the hard product.  While on a  flight both ways , was impressed  with the amount  more room both  in economy and business. USB ports  3 in economy , 2 in  business and large  TV screens. The food in economy  is better than  we have had  on domestic (US)  economy class and  air pitch was  comfortable for my  small frame. Attentive cabin staff who  made sure I  felt comfortable. Drink  service in Club  West was excellent  including good Rose water and Tanqueray.  The flat bed  was comfortable and  easily able to  nap for 3-4 hours. Due to  changes in travel  time I had  initially pay a  flat ticket fee  and even with  this and the  ability to upgrade  from Club World  but felt that  we got more  for my money's  money 1 free  sleeping bag for  WORLD Traveller and then 3 free  for Club World , navigating the  flight a breeze.  Would fly British Airways the next  chance I get."
1.0,Welcome to Palma  in new BA 'sardine' business class.  Flat seats with  limited leg room  with knees sticking  the passenger in . Poor service. Despite checking in  10 minutes before departure left 2  bags behind which  were not delivered  until more than  2 hours later  causing misery. Other  passengers also shocked  the conditions. If  this is the  first look business  on BA then better off with Easyjet or Ryanair  - cheaper and  conditions could not be much worse.
9.0,Flight to Marrakech and back. Bag drop was fast premium security slow (not BAs fault). Faultless calm boarding on time and a great flight with good service  and refreshments. Return flight bag drop even better departure a little late due to a  mechanical problem the 737s are getting on a bit.  Again great inflight service and only a little late. Bags arrived as we got to the belt. Am very glad we chose BA for a 3 hour flight. Really good.
4.0,We flew London Heathrow to Singapore  first class for  our first time with BA and was not impressed - the cabin crew did the  absolute minimum they could get away with and as for the seating arrangement we just could not get  their head around  this - thank goodness we changed our seats prior to flight - we sat on  only 2 outer seats that were ok though a bit narrow -  felt so sorry for the people who sat in the middle seats  as they had to face strangers  at the take off and landing - we fly long haul on this route 4 times a year and can quite honestly say that after our experience with BA we would not wish to fly with them again.
8.0,2017 B773 Newly  rebuilt cabin. Seats  very good and  our food was reasonable and entertainment was great HD TV with many  games
10.0,LHR-DEL. RTN Club World. Excellent service on both sectors and found that middle seats are good for companions.  One found the rearward seating disconcerting but was otherwise comfortable. Flight crews were excellent. I  would agree with aisle passengers that they must find  their need to  move across them at service times irritating.
9.0,"Fly BA from  London to New  York via London  on Premium Economy  flights in August. First leg was  with a 787  it was nice  although definitely does not have nearly  as toilets on  a Premium Economy  they have quite a walk to  their nearest lavatory  ( bad design).  The board service  was very good  as were great food was good.  Last leg from  Mumbai to New Delhi was on  a 777 much  better in my opinion that the  777 primarily as it has better  boarding facilities. Again  accommodation and service were top notch.  My return trip in October was made with our newborn baby. If anything the service was even better than on our first leg. Thankfully  they had a 777 on both  flights and not  a Dreamliner. Staff were incredibly helpful  very accommodating making  no fuss about  our baby and really always there  offering help. Again the food and beverage service was very good. The  chair reclining buttons  are a bit  odd but other  that that the  chairs were OK not excellent but  still comfortable enough.  Considering that I hadn't flown BA  since over ten years before these  trips (due to  poor service) I  felt really pleasantly  surprised by the  high level of  support provided by the airline. Yes being in Premium Economy helped but  it was very  hard comparing it  to Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy which I have regularly  enjoyed Well done , you made a trip that  many were dreading , quite a  good experience and  are likely to fly BA again !!"
10.0,Flying IAD-LHR in early October and it was one  on the best  planes I've taken.  Our seat may  be the same  width as on  some carriers but it felt a  little larger. I was stunned to be served a free cocktail and a free bottle  or wine with  lunch which was a totally edible chicken casserole in  each direction and a surprisingly good chicken curry in  that other direction.  There was also  able to get  my blanket and  chair (though I  had my own).  American carriers don't  give squat to economy passengers and  everyone was delighted.  It was the quickest most efficient  process ever seen  in an airplane.  Especially the entertainment ? Even the  loading process was  so well organized  – separate lines  with doors for  that section of the plane. This  is about as  bad as it  should possibly have  and I will  definitely fly an  air carrier to  America again. I  actually got a  great deal at  a little over  cost as fall  is a down season.
1.0,"Only at Gatwick to find out  that our pre-paid , assigned seats could not be  used due to  another aircraft change.  Instead of three rows of seats  C and B we were now slung across a  second row with  two middle seats  in an aisle/window seat despite having requested and paid  in the seat reservations 11 months  ago To make matters worse Prem Economy passengers had been bumped up to Club World  so were enjoying  their seats -  big joke. Food was OK crew  and friendly enough  and I will  NEVER travel BA  Enterprise due to  this absolute neglect or consideration for  our premium customers. Goodbye BA Executive  Economy and good  bye BA. How the once mighty  has fallen."
1.0,Just from London  and Calgary. The  toilets in the  first Dreamliner are awful. It was  hard enough sitting  in the seat  and when the  person in front  of me lowered  his seat it  seemed impossible. His  seat was right  between my legs  and shows how  no room there  is on these ! Staff started  making meals all  in a sudden  but by about  7 or 8 th of us  he forgot to  come back to  greet us.
7.0,The LHR-SFO seat  is in WT+  had a pretty  nice 747-400 check in and security  at T5 very  nice I used  a lounge at  JFK which was  great and close to the gate  I departed and  left 1hr late.  Also very good  on seat PTV  but food not  my best on  the flight. I've  flown BA a  ton over the  past 2 years  but find them  very consistent although  i also noticed  better service along  side seats PTV of course is  much nicer on the newer A380s  and the 777-300s  but it's worth  checking your aircraft.  Overall ok flight.
1.0,"A319 Barcelona to Heathrow Business no  time for boarding , missed any  kind of priority . Why pay extra for something  they are not  expected to get! Cabin service slow - over an hour until meal served had to ask for another  bottle as only  a small bottle ! They also ran out of the main choice meal and the cabin was not  even had second choice meal and this was cold. To Fly to  Barcelona - I think not. Terrible service for an airline that is supposed to pride itself on service."
1.0,"from Heathrow to  Southampton 29/09/14 B747. There was nothing  of all to  recommend this flight. I have had  great comfort and  comfort on low  cost carriers. The  aisle must be  THE narrowest in  Europe for any  British airline. The  customer lounge at  security is not  well signed and awkwardly placed at  very top of . At 0830  on the morning  the tables were  covered with used  paper and waste  - When staff  does appear they  did a very  thorough clearing job.  Never once in  two hours did  I see any  on the sticky tables being wiped , On boarding I was neither  taken to my seat nor addressed  my name as  I have been  on other airlines.  So I asked  about assistance in  getting my hand bag in the  hand locker - I was told  under no uncertain  terms staff were  never allowed to  help Again I  have always had  this on business  flights on other . In the air the level of discomfort rose  when those in  my inside seats  are forced to  sit over my out stretched legs  as cabin staff leant over me  to serve the inside seats. The  quality of service  could not remotely  be considered acceptable  at the price . Add in  the food and  beverage and decision  I avoid BA flights in future  was made for ."
5.0,I fly the POS to LGW route on a fairly regular basis  because the punctuality of the flight  was bad. I suffered two 6 hour delays within 5 weeks on  that route. The  first steward wasn't friendly at all and was borderline  abusive when asking passengers to take a seat when  the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on. The inflight entertainment needs updating. The screens are small and the resolution low. The seats were not comfortable either and you can feel every movement of the passenger which is sat behind  you whenever they reached for something in the seat pocket.
10.0,"We recently flew  with British Airways  long haul on  the flight from  London to New  Orleans havinh not  been travelled with  Royal Airway for  almost a decade. I had been  one huge fan  on British Airways  in the past  and was very  happy to see  all their inflight  technology and entertainment  systems changed in  that time. I  therefore was curious  to see Heathrow's  revamped Terminal 5.  The Airway's overall  service has improved  in that time.  On the first  trip from Philadelphia to London I  am very happy  and notice the new seats with  added comfort with  comfortable headrests and  the Audio Video  on Demand (AVOD)  audio systems. I 've been travelling  without noise cancelling  technology which made  the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one.  Every entertainment system  seemed sophisticated and  passengers enjoyed their  electronic music section  In particular. The  complimentary vegetarian meals  are of a  decent standard for  the most part.  Our only criticism  in this area  is that on  the second meal  arrived we only  were served a  single platter and  forgot to ask  what the croissants  somewhere else were ! In addition  we found the  toilets on the  Philadelphia sector to be hard as  hell Otherwise the  services were very good. Terminal 5  was a gem  in an airport  but the true  pleasure of the journey was on  that London-Philadelphia sector  where I had  the opportunity to  get on the  flight The plane  looks a marvel.  Most windows are  now dimmable by button too. The  windows are larger  then usual and  our flight was  extremely smooth. Additionally , legroom on  this Dreamliner is  excellent - an  upgrade on the  airlines And finally  one word about  their cabin attendants.  Their level of  interaction varies from person to person  but for the  main part they  were the best  example of British  Airways - informal ! All in , I was  satisfied with my  whole trip and  they continue to  rank as one  of my favourite  flights"
5.0,Front and back. 737-400s on both  routes These aircraft are looking very  dated now -  the worn cabins  bare and dingy.  The 'food' was a soggy half-wrap  and a filling-free  jelly roll -  this was unacceptable  for a 2hr45m . No choice offered by the  cabin crew even  if they had 3 options. The claim that their food offering is appropriate to the time of day is hogwash -  we were served  exactly the same thing at 10.30am on the outbound flight as at  noon on the return. Although we  recovered from it  on this trip  Airlines need to  review their hand luggage policy. There  really isn't space  in 150+ passengers to bring 2 bags which caused a lot of angst particularly on the return trip  when flights were completely full). On  one upside both  flights were on  schedule and the crews were friendly - the return crew dealt well with a potentially disruptive family group.
5.0,I have just flown economy class London to Los Angeles on the  US Outbound the meal was chicken which I do not eat so  i was offered  a almost inedible  chicken dish. No more food was  served until 2 hours before landing  and sandwiches I asked for a  grilled cheese and chutney was offered.  I was actually  impressed by this . Return journey was chicken curry replaced by vegetarian lasagne. Breakfast was  in a cardboard  tray containing a  fruit jam cereal bar and a packet of dried  beans The service  between meals was non existent. By far the worst airline food I have ever eaten. Sorry no British Airways for us.
8.0,"July 16th Ibiza  to London Heathrow.  What a great service as usual , we actually  were on time  and once 5  minutes ahead of  schedule that is  a miracle for  a Heathrow! The  good thing about  Qatar Airways is  that they only  have one drinks  but I am  told two is  way more appreciative  as I know  a scheduled airline  can do more  than one on  the 2hr flight.  This only gets  me a poor . But great  service all in  all"
6.0,"Tuesday 29/9 and  Sunday 13/10. We booked our original flights on WTP on the A380  / B777 both  times with the  BA World Traveller Plus - far  better comfortable than  an old style WTP with an  even better IFE . So guess how pleased I  was when BA  changed the aircraft on both flights , the now  long aged and decrepit B747's with  an old style . The 747's  probably should be pensioned off and replaced with A380's - they are  too grimy and falling to pieces. Our B747 was filthy. The catering on the way out to Washington  was not too bad - a half decent fillet steak. On the  flight back beef y but nowhere near as nice  and a truly  pathetic pathetic cold hard croissant and  bread that passed for breakfast. Inedible and disgraceful. Good  thing BA can't 't even pop them in the microwave for 10 %. The good  is both flights  arrived on time  - the FA's were OK. That's  OK This would almost be acceptable  except for the  next insult - charging for choosing your seat after  one of the  flight This is cheap nickel and  copper low cost airline stuff and not what you should expect from the nation's flag bearing airline. No  major major airline that I regularly use does this  - not even small ones like  American Airlines or United Express. It  is shameful -  and our American friends who flew BA back to Chicago were dumbfounded. You expect it on Ryanair or other low cost  airlines but this  really shouldn't happen on your national airline. I recommend  - but with enormous reservations - try to book  either the B777 or A380 and if you don't need to choose  your seat before  getting in you'll  feel OK."
3.0,"OSL-LHR in Business. BA has over the last few years put less priority on Oslo  whereas SAS today has a better offering. BA is the only flag  airline in Oslo that does not  offer fast track security. The Menzies  security staff are doing their best but does not have any authority to help when things go wrong. Particularly the evening flights are very often delayed due to late incoming aircraft from LHR , I have several times been an hour or more delayed and lost intercontinental flights as a result. The de-icing procedure is also much  better than on SAS. The lounge in Oslo is  good but not magnificent. BA has better service in  business class than SAS with better food and free middle seat. You do however pay  significantly more than for SAS Plus. The crew was  great and did their best on  my last flight but seemed badly trained forgot to  have bread with the meal and  spend a lot of time chatting in the galley.  I sometimes miss the old well  dressed BA staff.  We also very often offer internet access on the  night flights which  was a plus."
3.0,Welcome to Bergen Business no priority boarding bus out  of plane which  was packed -  really bad start.  Was cold slow  air service and  I fact glad  I get off.  Lunch was ok  and cooked English  food was nice.
1.0,"London JFK to  London 13 October  2009 The outward  trip had been  absolutely awful so the return surely  could not be  even worse. How  disappointed I was. Arrived at business  terminal at JFK  about 7. No  one at desk.  Security pass printed at machine but  had to wait  about twenty minutes  to check luggage.  Staff was rude and unhelpful. Onto  the BA lounge. Sagging shabby seats  with no food except crisps. On asking the receptionist  for the food  service I was  informed passengers normally  have the much advertised ""pre-boarding supper"" . Asked when  was opened and  was told it  is not operating.  Eventually some badly  burnt sandwiches and  boxes of cheese  on crackers appeared.  No hot food  was available. Two  days before departure  our flight was  reported as four  minutes late. No further information was  given When I  asked for an  extra thirty minutes  past scheduled take-off , was told there would be an announcement shortly. Eventually a barely  heard announcement came  that the plane  were now boarding.  My departures board  had not been updated so premium  passengers were forced  the shuffle along  to those in  a main cabin.  Even after presenting  the boarding pass  and was given  some grunted down  instructions with no indication as to which side of  my plane I  am seated. On  the late boarding  must have been  a blessing. I  kept count of  the times I  got knocked by  wet and heavy  hand luggage. Eventually  the safety demonstration  is played on the IFE system.  The sound was . Surely a  safety hazard. Similarly  the announcements from  my cockpit went . We took  off one hour  and fifteen minutes late with no  reasons given for  the delay. The  food selection was  very limited on  the flight as  on the menu two choices of  one course and  not one dessert . I asked  if I could have the advertised  whipped cream snack  or desert to  was told there  were none on . Food was  hardly edible. Service  very poor. The  flight crew seemed  intent on throwing  food round as  quickly as possible.  My salad was  replaced with desert  which I did not want) on  a tray. The  second course was  grilled beef near  the vegetables. I  was made to  look a nuisance  if I asked  for a second  bottle of wine.  My narrow seat  led to a  narrow and not  a comfortable bed.  Most carriers provide  blankets and duvets. BA seem to  feel a tacky  chair will do.  This whole service has been downgraded  below the standards I would expect in economy class.  All nicieties that  use to mark  the flights have been lost in  the pursuit of profit. Given that  they charge far more that their  rivals for this  flight I was thoroughly disappointed. I <mask> not use <mask> BA flight again if there <mask> an alternative <mask>"
10.0,Also impressed with  Business Economy on BA Sydney to Heathrow and return.  Wanted also to  receive an unsolicited upgrade to Business  to return Singapore to Sydney.
6.0,"St Lucia to  Edinburgh round trip.  Long flight both ways quite unhappy , on return leg tiny seatback  seats and poor  quality of entertainment  not satisfactory (taste  quality ok and  tried to fill  it up both  way on time ), was quite expensive for the  fare I got. Would fly them again if they  offered the cheaper  fares"
8.0,"Flight and return  - Traveller Plus (premium economy). Received a text from BA at 0600 that our 09:30 pm flight had been cancelled which would impact upon the US flight. Phoned the helpline as suggested. Utterly useless options provided  to their staff which was weighted towards a ticket refund - no use for a  return holiday. Made  some suggestions including can you get  to Aberdeen for the 7:30 flight (it was 7am and had now spent 1hr on  speaking to them). Gave up and just went to the airport. Fortunately BA staff there  were excellent and got me on next flight to  London despite breaching  their own min us 1 hour requirement for connections. Flight to London was good with good service leather  the Cabin crew facilitated us getting off plane first and BA staff  then met us to get us  the next gate  flight for Miami . Service centre useless but face  the face staff great. LHR-MIA flight. Aircraft a 747  was old and  new and WT+  seats were rubbish in comparison to  the product that I have experienced. Not that comfortable. Seat back TV is same as  before namely 4""  is tiny but selection was ok  - seats are  wide and didn't seem that much  better than economy.  Food (beef) was outstanding for aircraft food. Staff were pretty good. Aircraft on time. Return journey much the  opposite but staff  much better. Conclusion is that face to face staff , food great.  UK needs a modern fleet -  the 747 was  well aged and  old world traveller 's product needs work with hindsight  - would have just travelled economy as leg room wasn't that much more. If you take a iPad  to watch movies and are not tall economy would do the job. Their helpline needs to be addressed.  Note being in  the title - HELPline. Would fly  BA again but would think about  a WT+ option carefully."
4.0,LHR-DEN DEN-LHR - always use upper class in VA  whenever I can. This flight reminded me of just why I rarely fly BA. Most  in the crew were disinterested. I raised a couple  more points but I was told I was wrong  multiple times. Asked  about another glass  or wine twice  before my main the stewardess forgot  and denied that I had even  called for one.  Actually going out was pretty good but coming home  is awful. I  think one can just not get my head round  that seat formation.  I stare at some stranger on take off and landing food and drinks for passengers on the inner seats are pushed in front of your face.
1.0,Having flew one way MCO-LGW 6th  and the service  quality and overall  experience was so  low standards and  quality British Airways  have lost a customer for life.  Having requested assistance  due to illness  that I couldn't  do at Orlando  with just the  right lane to help me not . When boarding  staff wouldn't let  me board without  me with three  passengers just because  i was young  and didn't appear  and need assistance.  After this I  would barely make  myself to my  seat without difficulty  with the crew  was leant against  the bulkhead and  didnt even ask  how I was ? The drinks  were in excess  of an hour  and a lot  going in and  outside of the galleys with no  assistance The meal service took even  further and seemed disorganised no choice by the time  we got to  JFK The 2nd meal was a  very cold croissant  barely edible. Why  do they need to be chilled?  The temp would  suit them a  little better. The  leg rest was  knocked off its housing when I  made no attempt  of fix by ground staff or  move me into  a working seat.  The IFE screen was so tiny  it had squares  around it from  good old fashioned  flat screen technology definitely behind both  United and Thomson  for this route.  When I got  into Gatwick the  flight staff were just as awkward in providing me  medical assistance -  If you don't  look old then you shouldn't need  assistance Never again .
10.0,First class flight  to Toronto on  Thursday 6th October.  Friendly cabin crew  said first class food was very good. Smooth flight  including takeoff and landing. Would recommend  flying with British  Airways
4.0,"Welcome to CMB  and MLE and  BA Sept/Oct 2014.  As a British Citizen you desperately want to like BA but they  always make it  very difficult to  be so. The  recent documentary ""A Very British Airline""  fed our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service  should have returned to BA particularly  in the long-haul  business cabins. Sadly  for all the  while the cabin service was totally  average without any effort to do  less than the  bare minimum. Attendants  chewing gum no smiles everything was  just too much effort. The only time the crew  showed any animation  was when talking  amongst each other. Adequate is about the best description but it could have been so  much better without any cost except a bit of effort."
9.0,"Flew from LGW  into Catania. Lounge  from Gatwick was  good and staff  was attentive no lounge at Catania , and given vouchers instead which  also got a  nice cup of coffee from the  airport approved cafe  due to the  valid Schengen passport ! Flights both  way were good  and we liked  The Pilot pointing  out Lake Geneva  while telling us  about our route so nicely. The return flight back  at LGW the Captain was hard  to hear and wasn't so interesting.  But aside on  previous journeys we  are well looked  over with charming  people The food  is also good too and we  were on time. Baggage came very  easily at LGW  but at Catania  airport it was  a bit of  like carnival! I'm  afraid Catania airport  is the worst  place I've been  to but there  ya go! I  guess it is  part of the  fun of travelling."
8.0,"Thursday 6th October.  Plane drop at LHR pretty slow again - used lounge T5 South which I always like. A320 out which appeared new - a full  load of around 1.5hrs with a  lunch and drink served. Crew very  helpful and we arrived slightly early. Return check-in quick and then a long walk to the lounge which was shared with 5 or 6 airlines - OK not much food but pretty quiet and nice place to wait for  an A319 on return full again  - very nice the same sandwich and drinks served , arrived back at T5 on  return no bags  and out within  20 min."
2.0,A 4-class refitted with the new  WT Traveller and WT Plus cabins.  - Very disappointed.  For the outbound  flights the food choice was gone  before they reached the 4th row of the economy cabin meaning that myself and the  majority of the  passengers had to have the second choice meal - second choice for good reason. It was a truly unpleasant tray of  food The real  problem is the introduction of possibly  THE largest entertainment  centre box in  the floor space  we have ever seen. It literally  eats up half of the floor and prevents you  from stretching both  legs out. I  cannot know if  this is exclusive to the refitted B777's but it  is certainly a side effect of the new IFE and isn't there  for the the  economy cabins. The  screen seems to be under every  other seat on both sides of  this cabin. I  still don't understand  what the cabin designers were thinking  that this box  would take up so much of  the space that is already so  large They could have at least rounded off the corners. It seems rushed and last . This means  that I am now avoiding BA  when booking a trip if they  continue operating the  aircraft on the  return route. Bye  Bye Executive Club !!
4.0,Had a seat in World Traveller  Pass for an  extra €60 each ! This was to get an exit seat with  aisle and a window. Seat was  marked as window ! Yes it was an exit  seat but there was no window  behind the seat. The slide / raft box protruded from the exit  seat greatly reducing the amount of space for legroom. Seat beside me was empty but a guy was quickly moved into  it when he asked for it  with us having  only pay €60  one way for  both seats. Stewardesses  seemed friendly but  service was almost  none existent. The child portion chicken  soup was in no way filling. Was hungry throughout whole flight. No  drinks or snacks offered until about 1.5 hours before  takeoff when I  was given a  sausage roll with  some butter or  was completely dry  and unappetising.
7.0,The 6 flights  with BA recently  were satisfied though  the cutting in  First Class seems  to have got  OUT of hand.  Even Kitchen snacks  were shrinking with  food left half way through long  flight and meals  by choice less.  Although there are  many new business  grade seats out  here that are  available BA is  not acceptable especially  for very private  Economy seats. Crew  is excellent and  meal delivery consistent  in terminal 5.  Our one complaint  of these 6  flights would be  if no effort  being made to  reduce the amount  to hand baggage  off board even  on short flights  it takes so  long while stressed  passengers are trying  to find space  between large and  large bags when  many people have  2 or three  small bags each.  4 out of  5 flights were  delayed because of  security while they  had some bags  that would not ! Recent flights  by Easyjet have  not had this  issue they enforce  their rules so  you all know  are we stand.
1.0,"Not being completely  unfair to BA . Have found  my airline has  become tired and  slow in Customer  Experience from the  Flight Crew as  we fly economy  class at Company  One this class  business traveler is  seen by the  airline staff as  something to be  seen until the  end of the  day The aircraft s I fly  are from London  or Mexico city  is 747-400 these aircraft have obviously  flown many hundreds  of thousands of  passenger miles the  engines are mostly  well worn and  with a 12  or 13 hour  journey leaves one  without a very  sore part of  their anatomy toilets  that are more  times than not insecure or broken. Food offered is now without a menu you get  whether you are  seated or go  anywhere from two  and the famous  buffet breakfast is  now no more  of a sandwich  and a frozen  egg The inflight entertainment is often  non functional and  the resetting of  sound system is  the normal sound  which is always  pretty bad. My comments are not  directed at just one flight or  particular aircraft only  to have seen  some deterioration over  the a few  months whilst I  can appreciate economy  flight money saving  as today's norm , airlines to  me mind should  improve customer satisfaction  on all levels  above just the  first class and  first class customers.  You have seen  many airlines achieve  and maintain very  strong standards in  the economic world  for airline travel  and sadly BA seem to be trailing to an  alarming extent."
2.0,Travelled to Cyprus  at Gatwick in  BA as thought  flights would be  better as use able internally in  London As we  are tall thought  pitch pitch would  be same as ! Wrong. Dreadful  flight in extremely  cramped cabin my  back was virtually  crushed by the  people in front  and the only  good grace was  as we had  the spare seat  belt between us  as I think  I would have  stayed standing most  on the way. Poor service and  absolutely awful food  but you could  make it food.  Chicken and small  salad with nice  little dessert. Wrap  was soggy and  a roll dry  and hardly had any filling. Only  1 round of  coffee then tea  again with food  in a flight  of hours. Really  bad toilets and  air conditioning poor.  Really old and just a bad  travel experience. Took  too late too!  Have travelled in  the better flights  on charter airlines  so following this  and WILL NOT be patronising BA  planes in economy  because we have suffered the return ! Have gone  economy class which  was good but  it is dreadful.
1.0,Don't even think about flying on this airline. Booked paid for and confirmed last February for a premium  BA flight Singapore to Sydney for last Saturday. When I checked in at Changi the check-in staff member told me the incoming flight from London was overbooked  and I was downgraded to economy  despite my wishes ! I would never have booked BA but for the premium economy  fare so huge disappointment. GB75 compensation is simply not good enough. Add to that the economy meal was inedible (what did they do to  my seafood curry). Never again.
1.0,"London LHR-NCL. 10.10.14.  I arrived on  Friday at LHR from Brazil using  completely different carrier. Journey thus far  very enjoyable and on time. I  believe that that shortest final hop  up to the  north east is  often the most  frustrating and unpleasant . I arrived  early expecting to  disembark at Newcastle and get home late. However yesterday  morning I was wrong my flight  was running late  and was cancelled!  I had a  truly revolting encounter  involving one of their ""professionals"" in  London My courtesy and understanding towards  an inept individual  which was there to assist delayed passengers was rewarded  with the cheap , passive aggressive and generally dismissive  attitude which is  seen so frequently  from BA these days. No apology  or empathy just waffle and rubbish.  It just simply  never good enough and a terrible reflection of what  our flag carrier  has become. To  keep a long  and short I  arrive at NCL  three hours late.  To no surprises  My luggage was  put behind at  Newcastle But then again BA only  had seven hours  to transfer it  to my flight. Well done BA!  Probably the worst customer service that I have ever  seen anywhere!"
8.0,"Route: Heathrow - Toronto First Class  direct flight. Check-in  and security: The  latter was smooth  operation and efficient. The latter was  particularly poor on  the basis that BA make no special provision for  dealing with F class passengers either  in their own  terminal (Heathrow Terminal ), or any destination. F class  flights are not  allowed which I consider to be  another significant shortfall  when clearing immigration and boarding flights. Lounge: Flagship lounge (Concorde Room) is  fairly elegant reasonably  well staffed and  nicely located after  all Good food  and civilised portions  offered in the  menu and a  nice selection of wines. IFE and : The TV  was fairly decent  as on the  other 747s. Comfortable  seats / beds with decent bedding and PJs. Good  changing room which I notice at  times Practical sized amenity kit which is fairly well stocked. Food: Decent food and well presented. Selection is sufficient but no special options available . Crew: Generally  good crew who were professional. Not  the fastest of service in comparison to other F products. Crew and captain introduced themselves  to a number of passengers which sits between those  areas where all  people are chatted with and those  that don't. I would say BA  takes the right approach in that  staff seem to visually assess whether  each passenger looks  as they would  welcome a social  group - rather  than imposing it anyway."
2.0,BA038 PEK to  Dubai 28-09-14 Business  flight B747-400. First time I have flown BA long haul and in view of the many unhappy travellers on this site - I was keen to see  this myself. I can honestly say I have never experienced such a dreadful flight. Antiquated  and filthy plane is an experience I would never  like to make again. The seating in Business class downstairs is a disgrace I was  lucky enough to have the aisle seat 17G which turned in to  the flat bed so narrow my  wife and I  feel small was over the main  seat when asleep being continuously bumped and pushed. Absolutely no privacy in this seat and every one coming out of the toilet and standing  there waiting the  toilet area could  see my every move. Completely unacceptable. No mattress and  not a small blanket. There is nowhere to put even a pair  of glasses or  small bottle of water once the  changing table was  folded up (necessary  to sleep). To get to the centre seats where my husband was  sitting a dirty  little ‘window’ had  not be slid down and hot beverages and food had to be  carried across the whole time encroaching  into my personal space (what there was of it.) My husband said  the middle seats trapped passengers in and getting out involved stepping over people. Extremely difficult for short people. The whole design  for the business  level seats is  extremely uncomfortable and  deeply flawed. The  cockpit was badly presented and unappetising. The PA system  on the flight deck was inaudible  so could not  recognise the Captain in the pre  departure information announcement  One other issue was a very  slow in flight entertainment system which  required an hour  just get going  and even the  flight tracking information was not available for the whole  plane They weren’t  even concerned just  made apologies. The toilets were filthy  and grimy. The  bottom edges and  walls around the basin area where  seats were falling off were thick with dirty grease. I looked into  a galley and  it too including the floors and edges of preparation benches was full of grime. Total disgrace. The Cabin Crew seemed in  a state of  utter chaos having a great view  and seeing it  straight from my  seat Very little contact with passengers other than rather arrogant looks all round. Needless to say I will  NEVER travel BA long haul again. They need to get on to an Emirates Airline and see how it should be done. As a  regular long-haul traveller on Emirates the difference between these  flights is indisputable. Perhaps the so-called  unhappy BA customers  have never been on a Emirates flight to compare  the difference.
5.0,We flew BA  to London to  Washington DC 10/8/2014.  Because we were  travelling in economy  class space was very tight but  our staff could not have been  as accommodating which  certainly helped.
2.0,"B787. Just returned from a London - Toronto -  Vancouver flight. BA appear to be proud of their  latest ""Dreamliner"" but they have scored a real own-goal by cramming 9 seats into each  plane 3+3+3. The only way this has been achieved is by fitting  planes that are  even narrower than the norm. We are well used to airlines having unjustifiably uncomfortable seat pitch but this  was the first time I have  seen myself wedged  into such a narrow seat -  and I am  very slimly-built! Unless BA changes their 787s to a  similar layout I will now have no alternative but to make sure I am not flying in a  row thus often avoiding BA altogether. I will let  my BA steward have the last word: ""The first time I sat in one of  these seats I could not believe  what bad they are"" - and he like me is slim. Come  clean BA -  start having a  high regard for  your customers' comfort and health."
9.0,"I travelled to Hong Kong with British Airways from Heathrow on a 777-200 outbound and one of their new A380's on the way back both in World Traveller. It had been a long time since I had travelled with BA (18 years!) but it was one of my better flying experiences. I didn't know what to expect this time round but the seats had plenty of leg room on the 777 on the way out. I was annoyed  because I was told to pull my window blind down as other people were sleeping  and I had specifically asked for the window seat  for a reason.  Thankfully the crew were great and asked if I'd like to look out of the window by the jump seat which I did for a good few hours! Not only that the crew called the flight crew and the co-pilot walked to  one back of the plane to have a chat with me and gave me a map with all the points of interest highlighted with the times we would be above them! Airlines don't have to spend any money to truly satisfy passengers. The seat on the 777 was quite comfortable and the IFE had plenty of selection.  Our food was good not dried out and it was tasty. All the toilets were operational and were clean. On the  trip back I was upstairs on the A380. The aircraft was extremely  comfortable comfortable and the A380 was  oh so quiet in all areas of the flight which really surprised me. I really loved the 'seat "" next to my window seat which easily fitted  the contents of my hand luggage. Food was good again and the crew were again amazing allowing me to visit the  flight deck after the flight had safely arrived at Heathrow. Toilets were clean and tody and all operational and the IFE was good. Leg room was good. The only thing I would say is that the IFE does take up a lot of space under the seat meaning that hand luggage  should really be stored there and it can get in the way of your feet."
9.0,LHR-MXP-LHR. Check in/bag drop at T5 once again very  slow appears to  be a staff shortage at some times of the  flight My FFS allows me to use the lounge  as I had  time for a quick coffee I like the BA lounges at T5.  Check on time seat 26A on  an A320 seemed new with a nice crew a snack and a drink served. Return check in quick Milan Malpenza Airport is horrible! Managed to find lounge close to B35 limited food but quiet wifi was  good although there  is a smoking  area Boarding quick seat 19A and another newish A319 full flight snack and drink served crew very chatty early arrival at . Good product although I booked  the day of  travel so a bit expensive.
9.0,"All 6 BA  flights as part  of a OneWorld  travel trip. JFK , Berlin via  BA then 4  weeks later Berlin  via MAN via LHR and 6  weeks later Nice to DXB again  by LHR. All flights on time  The cabin crew  were attentive and  highly professional. Refreshments  provided and drinks  were appropriate for  all flights and  hours of day.  I was a  joy to fly BA after 5 flights with AA.  Had one small  little problem with  a ground agent  on LHR while  waiting for DXB. We were snapped  up and told  the wait while  our passengers (presumably  first class) boarded.  we were not  on the business  class 'line' but  just happened to  be standing near  some of the  two gates where  our passes were ! The ground  agents obviously thought , we were  first class passengers  about to board ! Overall a  highly satisfactory rating  for these flights.  Could not use  WiFi so unable  to give a  recommendation"
2.0,"Flight from SYD  to London return.  Great service on  time - nobody  got to the  toilet Had to  pay extra to  get a seat  to advance. The  excellent food - all 3 meals  consist of paneer , both journeys."
1.0,"Compared to LHR  the Seats were  in the new  with only 30 % both in  Standard and Economy.  New seats are  quite uncomfortable and  their is very  limited room to  eat or work  unless the passenger  up front reclines  his seat. The  BA cabin looks  very small with  the new seats  and I would  NOT recommend anyone  looking to work  and fly with  BA now. The  crew was not  in a good  mood and when  asked you could  hear passengers telling  someone to turn  your phone off  with no crew  came to find  out what was  went on they  are more concerned  with their own . I hasten  too add that  it is the  poor cabin crew  at the thunderbird , who are  vastly inferior to the well paid , BA short  flights can now  be classified as  the Low Cost  and now they  have lost all  hope of customer  loyalty & customer  satisfaction"
1.0,"LGW to SZG. Absolutely useless for a scheduled service  that would not  recommend to anyone. Booked flights to Salzburg for travel in September way back in April  but chose the  cheapest flight as most convenient even though more expensive.  Fortunately we arranged an overnight stop in Gatwick as we live in  far North of England as otherwise don't know what  I would have  thought when our flight was cancelled  after notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. We were  put on the  4 am flight  that meant being at Gatwick for 5am. This is a much cheaper flight but no  automatic refund is available its take it or leave it with BA. Our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this  and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday.  Having taken the trouble to complain to BA I  am amazed it took 8 days to send a  completely unsatisfactory short response which ended with ""we hope you fly with  BA again to  regain your confidence  with our service"". BA need to learn that scheduled service means just that and plans  were made around the timings that  can just be altered with no notice. I would not trust or travel with them again."
1.0,Reviewed 4/10/14 YYZ-LHR B787 G-ZBJE. If you want to  see what Ryanair long haul will  be like sit in E on  this BA 787. Appalling legroom seat width and non  flat IFE. Gold  seat holder flying  about 200 trips a year. Absolutely horrendous experience good luck to anyone taking the 12hr+ trip to Chengdu  try it! New plane with the  smallest seats ever.  Some passengers tried  and stand the entire trip to  reduce the discomfort!  Unless you are anything more than a medium build and have a bum and hips  we will have a very uncomfortable flight. I am  no one to moan but this  means the end  to me BA!
10.0,Very comfortable return  trip to Hannover  Golf Club Europe.  Airbus A319 appeared to be new  but food for  this short flight  tasted very good :
2.0,We took British  to London to  JFK Tired airplane.  First business class.  Pretty basic service.  No wifi. Nobody checking to see  whether you were  taking in something to drink. Basic  English food. Very  expensive
8.0,"BA16 SYD-LHR 4 Sept Brand new , great VDU and excellent music  playing quality with own headphones. Supplied headphones did not  interfere Warm attentive stewards. Low salt  but very tasty. Always served first  but would have liked standard English breakfast - not low salt. Seat though standard economy , soft. BA9 LHR-Bangkok 18 Sept  Flight 777. Stewardesses  professional and human in their approach. VDU not that brilliant. Food also quite satisfying. Bags on both occasions arrived promptly. Well  done BA."
10.0,"320 / LAS-LHR-NCL.  Airbus A320. Comfortable  seat for only  a 1hr flight.  They did a  good job serving a full flight  with such a  limited space of  people Overhead bins  are full and  was a bit  of finding space.  Many passengers had  a very small  bin overhead and  also under seats  and refused to  put them down  but did seem  to have more  space than allowed.  Set off on  arrival and arrived  late but this  time no stand  still for 15mins.  Same on A380.  paid to get  two economy seats  in the upper  cabin together and  was worth the  cost as no  seat next to  us no moving  no loo breaks ). Aircraft excellent  service great (games ), good moving  chairs etc also  flight crew superb  Food was nice  the meal very  good and the  chocolate lollies were  in great touch  but did think  that extra drinks service would have  been good. We  sat close to  the galley so  easy enough to  sit and ask  the drinks which  we did two/three . Seat was  ok but equal  compared to the  older A320. Extra  space beside seat  very useful. The  back rest doesn't  go all the  way up which  were a bit  of a pain. Take off delayed  with a fault  with the airbridge  but arrived on  schedule - takes  little while to  drop off due  a number of  seats LAS-LHR on a B747. Older  flight and compared  against the brand  name A380 it showed Again paid  for get two  seats together which  were worth it.  Flight ok but  Not as comfortable  as previous flights  Cabin was ok , was ok  but my PTV  went off centre  and had to  sit sideways. Overall  had an ok  flight Crew were  great and didn't  give away all  bags which normally  happened on late  flights with other  flights My only  complaint was the  leg rest didn't  line up and  when the seat  on front of  me reclined I  cant get out.  Started on a  plane Super quick , not 100%  perfect but crew  all worked quickly  and get everyone  drinks and snacks.  Was 15min early  and took a  bit for bags  to come off  of NCL."
1.0,Traveled to Rome  on British Airways.  By the way  that everything went . A day  of our departure  we were told  about the flight  is overbooked and asked politely to  change to a  later flight. We  were told that  they would pay  back the taxi (the flight was earlier and no  other transport was available.) as well as for the  room that we were missing at  a hotel. We  wanted to change  because we sympathized with BA representative  who had a  good job of asking people to  switch to a different flight and  that we wanted  only support British  Airways Big mistake. Apparently everything we  were told by their representative was  total lie and  no refund for  our taxi fare  is given to us. So much for doing BA 's favor they  are not a  nice company they once were.
7.0,BA26 22/6/2014. During my trip to the UK I feel very pleased that I chose BA. The A380  was superb. The  John Thales inflight  flight was more than excellent. There were 1250 hours of On Demand to choose from. Although the food  was quite limited I really liked the entertainment and the staff service. First class service in economy class!
1.0,Flying from IST  to LHR on  July 29. In  fact an abomination  for a business  class flight lasting  almost 4 hours.  It started with a dirty dingy cramped lounge with  very limited and  terrible food and  drinks selection and  not very far  before the boarding  area I have  seen the Star  Lounge lounge at  JFK Airport and  it is light ed ahead of  this BA lounge.  Our plane was  an ancient B767. The business class  seats had little  elbow room or  seats were packed  in hard and  quite uncomfortable. It  took 1 hour  for any drink  or food service  would start and  passengers were served  only champagne and  a small bag  with stale nuts. This was followed  with a hot  meal which was totally different from  that described in  any menu which  has been handed  down and this  became apparent only  after the food service began. There  were only two choices nothing vegetarian.  Flight crew were  very disinterested and  bored The entertainment  experience consisted of  the several old screens suspended from  the ceiling and showing the movie  Titanic which doubtless  had a big  success with the  6 year olds  among the audience.  At the end  of the flight  passengers were given  our cards to  speed up our  way through customs.  Unfortunately only 3  in the 6  customs booths were  full and we  end up effectively  on the slow-track .. To add  salt to injury  this business class  ticket cost $200  higher than that  from its competitor  American Airlines and  bore little resemblance  with the business  flight service and  amenities described on  this BA website.  Click on British  Express for this !
6.0,"On the new  Boeing Business Class from PHI to  BA The aircraft  looked impressive. It  is quiet and comfortable. The lower altitude cabin and  the higher humidity  were not noticeable in flight but  their lack of  turbulence was noticeable.  Cabin was very good. The business  section was 2/3 empty. The cabin  amenities were very  good The negatives  were the seating  and entertainment system.  Despite the large  size the rear facing seats were  of poor design.  Their feeling of  flying was uncomfortable. I guess the  new seat they  were in makes  this all worth  going to the  airline The amount  and choices in  all the video , and the  seats left a lot to be  seen Return was  not a 777. The seating and entertainment were the  negatives This and  the A380 use  always be my  first airplane. However  this 787 has become favorite airplane . I think  it is the  only time I  will fly BA  business class until they change their  plans"
4.0,From Heathrow -  we did not really see the BA hospitality. The  service was poor  and the seat very uncomfortable. This experience makes me very frustrated the only good thing  being the low price.
3.0,"On to YVR.  October 29 2014.  Having been a loyal BA passenger for years but  after three recent  departures that's not  seem to be  a case any  longer How BA  had the audacity to screen 'BA ' Very British  film on their  flights is beyond  belief While the  film chronicles the  relatively high standards  for rigorous staff  education and training  the reality is  quite different. The  seating on BA85  prior to YVR  is atrocious -  a chicken sitting  with a dubious brown 'sauce'. The  food was unsmiling , and inattentive.  BA used to have a good  film selection. Not  anymore Very unimaginative selection of films TV and audio . I've recently  been on Qantas  or Air Canada 's long haul  - both carriers  vastly superior to BA. Air Canada has significantly improved  safety standards."
1.0,"London - LHR.  what a miserable  flight this was. This return ticket  was £950 for  my total of  around 140 mins  flight time. I  check in online  as there was  severe delays on  board as there  was following a  delayed call back  to the UK  for equipment change  between an A319  from an A320.  But I checked  in online eventually and made my  way through security.  They asked an  attendant post -  flight to where  the Club /  First class lounge  went and I  was told it  will land side , between ""this  terminal and the  next terminal"". I  do not believe ! Surely a  more prompt online  before checking in  online could have  shown me this.  We left on  a a reasonable  late lunch and  a Gin and  Coke later we  sat stacked over the East End  in 25 minutes  and landed ""ahead  on schedule"". A  horrible experience from  a so called  "" favorite airline""."
7.0,"Flew from LGW to PFO and back recently. Plane was old tatty , but at least we got  about 34"" of legroom which the  budget planes no  doubt have. Flights were on time . ways food was reasonably good  the cabin staff were charming (specially on the outboard ). I was surprised to find BA no longer has a Club  Zone at Paphos and even more  so to find  that there was  no comfortable lounge  area that BA 's Europe passengers were unable to ! We were  given vouchers as compensation and thought  I would at least get a glass of wine and a sandwich - but no. The vouchers were  at such low value they could only be redeemed  on things like  the local beer crisps and chewing  tobacco Even though  the flights were quite good I feel that BA are treating their Club Europe passengers with contempt by denying them any  special access or  any compensation -  simply by refitting their aircraft to  allow passengers less seat width and  less same legroom as economy. Why  sacrifice a premium  price for a  less premium product?"
8.0,Economy from LAX to CPT via  BA Airbus 380 on first leg 747 on second. Both flights completely full. Airbus quiet  cabin on upper deck with a window seat. Room underseat very limited due to two entertainment boxes but storage by window  was compensation. For  this new plane  it isn't very  big - rather  cramped and I prefer the old-style head rest on  the 747s. Great entertainment screen. 747  seat v comfortable and softer but  seat is showing its age and  stiffness after a 380 flight and the seat back  is smaller than many phones these . Staff on  board v helpful  & pleasant - more functional on  first CPT leg. Special meal not provided on last  legs of CPT  leg - otherwise  tasty and edible. Boarding easy at LAX more chaotic with less waiting  room space at Heathrow - they really didn't plan  any waiting areas  right at Heathrow - just too  chaotic and poor layout. And transferring through from section  B to section a and then back to section b at Heathrow is a real pain and the shuttle was very full too so  I avoid if possible. Otherwise flights  in time at both destinations despite  running late. Heathrow  was the main drawback when using BA and transferring - what a shame that they didn't make it  bigger when planning the new terminal.  BA was a joy to use in comparison -  super smooth and  staff extremely pleasant  - helpful despite having a poor  design
3.0,"BA 084. YVR  - LHR on  Feb 28 2014.  Economy economy. Much  unlike previous experiences  while in this  flight on BA.  Staff were indifferent  or inattentive. The meals were deplorable!  This being a  full cabin there  is only one  meal choice left  mid way through : dinner service  - a very  heavy and overly  large pasta dish  followed by an  incredibly heavy piece  of dry chocolate . Hardly suitable food for a  long flight. Breakfast  is worse -  an equally heavy  english muffin and / or coffee.  So poor! A  number of seats  inside this cabin  had metal boxes  - rendering the  few additional leg room useless. IFE  was below what  BA used to  have in terms  on quality and  amount of programming.  All very unpleasant , and definitely  well worth the  additional cost."
7.0,LHR to Amman Jordan Airbus 321. Outward flight delayed  2 hours due  an unloading a  bag and technical  problems on the  ground Flight completely  being upgraded to  Clubs World. Cabin  staff there excellent  & attentive. Seat  size was OK  - not special.  Food was good.  A very small  space next to  a pilot door . Club World 's Terminal 1  on its last  stop but check in was quick.  The trip was  in Economy-what a  difference
9.0,LHR-FCO. Flew out Club Europe courtesy of a reduced  flight by BA. We thoroughly enjoyed  the experience. The Lounge in the  lounge was more  spacious than the  main T5 terminal. As it was an early flight  the food was  Belgian pastries and  the bacon baguettes which were excellent. Nice way to start a journey.  The flight was  comfortable Very attentive  staff on the B767. My colleagues  have recently flown easyjet and hadn't flown Club before and were very  happy about the experience. The return was economy on  a new A320.  Even with the new style seats  it again was a good experience.
10.0,"Flew BA055 LHR to JNB on  my new A380. What an absolute pleasure that was. Had seat 50H which was at  least on top deck. The cabin was nicely laid out I have to say I like the BA ""cocoons"" I know a lot of people do not  but gave me plenty of privacy. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive with high  class food and excellent champagnes and wines. I would fly this plane again over any other. What was also amazing was a toilet that was not a rabbit hutch. Flew Back on BA056 3 weeks later.  Changed seat only to find that the seat function did not work New plane and breaking already! Not a major problem as stewards moved the seat manually for me. The quality of the food and beverages  were up to  a same high standard as when I flew out.  The choices were excellent and the quality of the new screens way above those on the older 747's and 777's. I  had to get good sleep on both legs at least 7 hours."
7.0,Flight to Amman Jordan Airbus 321. Outward flight delayed 2 hours due  an unloading a bag and technical  difficulties on the ground. Flight completely full upgraded to  club World. Cabin crew there excellent  and attentive. Seat  service was OK  if not special. Food was good.  One very small  bathroom next to  my pilot door . Club World . Terminal 1  had its last  day but check in was quick.  The trip was  in Economy-what a  ride
9.0,LHR-FCO. Flew out Club Europe courtesy  on a reduced fare by BA.  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The  mood in the satellite was more relaxed than the  main T5 terminal. As it was  the early flight the food was  breakfast pastries and  double bacon baguettes  and were excellent. Nice way to start a journey.  Nice flight was  comfortable Very attentive staff on the  flight My colleagues had recently flown easyjet and hadn't flown Club before  and were very complimentary about the experience. The return was economy on a new A320. Impressed with the  club style seats and again was a good experience.

10.0,"Gatwick-Colombo via Maldives , return 22/09  New World. 777-200 3 class flight  was good as usual inflight meal OK. I really would be happier with a selection  on starters and  the main course.  All worked really  good as there  was a few  more passengers! Full London-Male-London just a  handful of us continuing to Colombo , surprised BA  are stopping the Colombo service from 28 March 2015."
10.0,London Aviv to Glasgow via Heathrow. Club World on ex BMI A321 so a different seat to the usual BA Club World product. Overall an excellent flight  with service all round. The crew in Club World were a real credit to BA  who could not do enough for you. Catering was excellent the seat was very comfortable in all positions and the airport experience at all ends was quick  and easy. Overall an excellent premium product made even  extra special by  our cabin crew.
9.0,"JFK to LHR - Despite the image the BA  marketing show conveyed The Galleries Lounges  at JKF is the worst run of all the BA Lounges I have visited. I have had more polite service at Macdonalds than at the desk in the Galleries. There was nothing business class or tranquil about the space. The spa was a fully booked with no appointments for two hours and ""the sorry we can't be  of service today"" was more than  enough especially given the £6K ticket price and the message was delivered with such insincerity. How can BA get it so right offering 1st Class service in London Miami Boston Seattle Hong Kong and Sydney (to name a few) and offer budget airline service with a mediocre selection of sandwiches in JFK. Boarding was a mess. They were boarding a Qantas flight at the adjacent gate and all the passengers got mixed up. We asked a BA member of ground staff  how to queue and she said she did not know and it  was nothing to do with her!  Premium and Business class passengers were directed down a cul-de-sac marked fast track which came to a dead end in a sea of passengers and eventually all the premium passengers joined the line behind the economy passengers and boarded last. We ask ""why"" as the lady gave us  all our boarding cards and she said ""nothing to do with me"". Upstairs on the 747 in Club was excellent professional attentive staff good food and wine good entertainment BA at its best the only flaw was no menu  and because of  our mistake at JFK no surprise. Heathrow ground services were smooth and our bags arrived in no time at all. I will fly BA Clubworld again but not to JKF I will use Virgin who offer  the ground services at JFK which match the price of the ticket and they value their customer more."
9.0,"Flight to London : Delayed take-off  in Rome largely because the plane  was held on  its runway for nearly 30 mins.  Aircraft clean and  very good condition. Staff attentive and professional. Seats adequate  despite short journey  but legroom is not generous. Food , drink welcome , the food  expensive and unnecessary  is relatively short , BA could  save money by  switching to beverages."
1.0,In Germany. You really wonder sometimes with BA. I paid £940 return and what a joke. (Last year  I flew Stuttgart and Berlin in Club for about££600 and was very happy). Firstly the flight ran from T1 at LHR. T5 Club lounge is rather good. On first sight the T1 lounge looked OK. I arrived at 15.03 and was told hot food was not available after 3pm. With a bit of grovelling I managed to get a plate of Singapore Chicken curry from the waitress. The whole  dining area consisted of a few miserable sandwich's peanuts and a miserable looking soup. Drinks ok. Flight was an A319 which left about 40 minutes late. Couldn't be bothered to eat the Prawn salad - which actually looked ok. FA's were fine.  That summary a real big BA con. Flight was one hour and  at £450+ per hour it costs more than a 7 hour flight . First to JFK. A miserable experience.
7.0,"On to Alicante  Airport on 8th  the early flight.  It was disappointed  because due to  the changing the  flight the seat in the exit  row that I  requested and paid  for for was  still available and  someone had failed  too inform me.  A seat allocated  on the Boeing  was quite cramped  to my frame  and I was  not that comfortable.  I had tried  and get this changed before the  change on line  but all I  got was a  note to phone  me after the  change There must  have been other  people affected in  that change. That  day the flight  left on time , the proffered  the croissant and  snacks were fine.  Everyone attentive and  attentive The return  on 22nd was  the 16.35 departure  time again was  fine and my  seat choice was  as I had requested. The snack was fine and  the small bottle  Of Pinotage was  just enough. Due  some turbulence about  which we had  been kept informed  by frequent announcements  on the first  flight and captain  the ride was  little bit bumpy  every half an  hour or so.  To think that  BA needs to  kill some of  their old dinosaurs and invest in  new planes like Easyjet and Ryanair  seems to be  something to do.  But by booking  online I got  the great price  on luggage allowance  for a snack  that I can't  complain I also  got the ability  too carry on  a laptop as  well as a  small bag avoiding  all of the  usual horror stories  associated with the  old airlines. I  do like to  fly the flag""  and shall continue to do so  but a bit  more investment in new planes would  seem nice."
8.0,"London on Sep 18 both legs on an Airbus 320 in Club Europe (Business Class) both legs on time or almost on time with an excellent crew (as most times with BA). Transfer procedures in LHR Terminal 3 were  quick and friendly even the extra security checks required for all transfers at LHR (even Intra-EU) were hassle free and easy.  The scheduled layover was a rather long 3 hours. BAs Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 was also comfortable with excellent drink selection and quite good food selection. I fly the VIE-LIS route regularly  so surprisingly transferring at LHR is superior to most alternatives on the  same route (especially to the more common alternatives FRA , and even AMS and BRU) with the possible exception of ZRH so taking BA  to LHR is a really good  option if the direct TP flight  is not an option for whatever reason. The only negative I have to say that both flights featured the new BA slim seats which are really a huge step back in comfort compared to the old seating. Seats in Club Europe are economy seats with limited seat pitch and the middle seat left empty. Its just like flying with Star Alliance with their  new Recaro slim seats. Catering on the VIE-LHR was afternoon tea which  rivals BAs weakest  of Europe service with bland sandwiches  but acceptable scones. Even their Chicken Tikka sandwiches in economy are better but they have  great bar service  including brilliant attentive FA’s so I believe BA is still one of best options to fly within Europe. Catering on the second leg was a good prawn salad (or a  pasta dish). However my luggage did  not make it to LIS that day which was an unwelcome and unexpected surprise after the long layover in Heathrow. But the issue was handled well fast and friendly by Groundforce the company who does the luggage handling for BA in LIS . I received my luggage without any further hassles the next morning. Not a perfect  service due BA’s  problems seating the delayed luggage and the VIE-LHR catering but still pretty good service. As a side note VIE airport is getting worse and  worse Long lines  at security with only two of the available four lines open. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE  but was overcrowded with basically not a seat available  or sit down and limited food service. But at least BA uses the old terminal which is still far superior to the new skylink terminal used by  Stars Alliance which really is a  question piece how not to design <mask> new terminal."
2.0,"2 recent flights LHR to SFO (12 hrs) - 7th Sept then San Diego to LHR (9 hrs) 21st Sept BA 272. Club World cabin. Wife and I have flown business class on - Singapore Air New Zealand Emirates Air Malaysia and Virgin on 20 occasions to New Zealand by various  airlines so we  were familiar with the service provided at this level by other airlines. BA in our opinion doesn't come close. Briefly: - being charged £284 extra to reserve seats how do  they get away with it? Personally we felt uncomfortable with the back-to-front seat layout too enclosed and awkward to get out of (we were in the inner cell) and I would imagine irritating for the outside  cabin as well to have people clambering over their legs. Details - ""hot towels"" threadbare  sheets of cloth that were stone cold in under ten seconds and then only one and nothing for morning wake-up cheap , menus lukewarm tea and coffee thrust over the barrier in mugs , sudden rattle as the screen was lowered and a basket of bread rolls thrust under your nose having to reach out sideways to receive meals embarrassment  Not disturbing the outside passenger trays passed over them minute napkins (expect paper sheets anytime  the cabin crew just doing their job walking up  or down the aisles at great speeds so as  they avoid being  asked for something cold soggy croissants which are an insult to croissants , don't get me started about the bacon roll! We were offered a drink before dinner and had to ask for a top-up one glass of wine with dinner (dry tough steak) and a refill after we had finished eating no after  that drinks were offered. Lights out-see you in the morning! I could go on but suffice to say we are so disappointed that our  own airline could be so far behind the others."
5.0,Flight LHR-NCL 18/09/2014. As is the  case flight departed late. Cabin crew  was passive aggressive. Going through security at T5 prior to boarding was a more customer  oriented experience. Landed with the customary jolt at NCL.  Is there an alternative? Of course not! Not an experience to make  you want to  consider BA my long haul carrier of choice. And an experience which is repeated frequently.
7.0,We flew on the A380 from  London to Jo'burg return economy class.  We thought the  service was excellent.  The crew were  extremely helpful and the meals were good. We flew in the bottom level one way  and the upper level on the return - I liked the upper level better. There  are convenient storage units by the window seats. Keep  to mind the  cargo compartments are  still upstairs though. Would definitely fly  with them again.
1.0,"So our outbound flight to Orlando was delayed a good 2 hours , not sure  why I expected  the service from  before coming home. Over a day before our return flight was due  their was already a delay posted  for our flight  of a whole  4 hours. The  following morning we wake to find  that flight now  cancelled at the  beginning of the next day at  around 12 in  that evening! We  scheduled our flight to leave Saturday so we would  return home on Sunday and be  prepared to go  in to work  on the Monday. But thanks to  the reliability of British Airways not only had we  paid for two  days now immensely  ridiculously overpriced flights  but will be  making money from not being able  to attend our  own Absolutely disgusting show from BA  we honestly wouldn't even chance a  return flight with  BA for fear  of having to cancel numerous plans due to the  incompetence of a shoddily run business! I won't be recommending BA in  general I will  just encourage everyone I meet to  shun their awful  service at all costs!"
8.0,Stay in Economy. Very relaxed and  easy check in  at T5. A  VERY attentive and  helpful cabin crew  served wine dinner  and the same  English breakfast as  10 years ago.  Always clean and  spacious interior on 777. Punctual and  that goes without  saying that the flight crew are  great and you  feel safe. Will definitely seek to  fly again.
7.0,Sent to PHL on 787 online  checking in worked well T5 first  Class lounge very nice good choice of drinks available food could be better but nothing to complain about. Priority boarding worked well too. Service always very good  ( every month to the US). Did not eat anything because I wanted only to sleep. Had seat  3 (middle seat  on the end of the first club world cabin) which gives you a lot of private space. Entertainment system good but  a better selection necessary. Overall I  only recommend BA however on most of the Asian airlines you have  better seats.
9.0,BHD-LHR. I flew  direct from Belfast George Best Airport  to London the flight was very good and on  time and uneventful.  My crew was excellent and the aircraft was a  Airbus A319. The  weather was ok.
9.0,Flight in Club Europe (on Avios). Easy check-in and security. BA lounge reasonable - good selection of drinks  - slightly stale looking but tasty ! Bus out to plane. Nice welcome in Club  European cabin on brand new A320.  Overall comfortable albeit less legroom than . Food excellent served by very attentive cabin crew. Good updates from pilot. Very good flight overall.
8.0,"In between LHR  at JFK and  my return leg  via IAD to  JFK and onward  at KUL on  Sunday I must say BA has  delivered excellent product ! The crew  seem extremely friendly  and are attentive.  Customers are kept  busy the entire flight with juice  or water being served consistently. The only setback is  that their B747  has seen better  weather and is  a dire need  for a refurbishment.  Service was good but the IFE  should be improved , with enhanced audio and video selection. I will  definitely fly with  BA again. To  all crew keep up the good work."
2.0,"From Heathrow -  on return. Have always been loyal to BA but no longer. T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not  very pleasant. Bags not tagged priority.  Flight Track not . Service on  arrival to Madrid was exceptionally good and old style BA. Return bags  Not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with  no attempt at service beyond handing ! Very disappointing , and unacceptable.  did not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated . Eventually seats  selected when called  off centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. Waste of time and energy.  Unfortunately everything suggested as part of the Club Europe package didn't happen. Club Europe used to be so distinctive and worth and I always felt it was worth the premium price. To be honest I have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which I will now be using for my regular flights to and from  Spain"
8.0,"Flew LHR-BUD 11  September BA866 and return 15 Sep  Flight 869 Club : Early morning  arrival from T3 , breakfast in lounge. Usual assortment  on cereals and  fruit etc but  small selection of  fast food (although  my bacon roll  was delicious). As  was usually the  captain had to  ask for champagne  and staff happy  to oblige and  they brought it to our table.  Plenty of staff  happy and the  entire lounge appeared  to be kept  nice and clean.  had to board  for a bus  but there was no preference given  to business passengers.  Easy to get  on the bus  early and got to seat without  a problem. Plane had been refitted  with the new . Beautiful cabin and the seats  are lovely but  where is the  extra leg room . Club. Big  room It feels  slightly claustrophobic and  sometimes the person  in front puts  the seat back. Not as nice  as place to  eat compared to  our old club , aesthetics notwithstanding.  Breakfast crew plenty  of champagne and  a surprisingly good  buffet breakfast of  roast mushrooms bacon , sausage with  banana bread. Coffee still poor however.  The IFE apart  from progress maps  and information on  big screen from  at BUD airport  was disaster. No  sign at all  to clear immigration  but had to  wait almost an  hr for bags  and priority tags didn't seem to  be any difference.  No aircon in  baggage collection and  queues with people  asking for bags.  Very uncomfortable and  cramped On return  to lounge BA 866 at BUD  was small with very limited selection  on food and  drinks but all  seemed acceptable. A  brief delay was  seen at check  point and gate  check but all  over all no  real problem. Priority  tag worked well. Same plane configuration  for return. Excellent  atmosphere up front  and return too  and plenty of  food and chat.  Tax free with the booze and . Food was again a surprise  and I had  chicken with a tandoori sauce and  rice with cauliflower.  Really tasty. BA can be hit  or miss but I thoroughly enjoyed  my flights. A  very soft product if they can  meet the standard but the new  build out is  another disappointment."
5.0,Used BA for a return trip to Denver and  am very disappointed. Plane was old  with tired cabin  never did the  repairs required and  cabin was basic.  Also flown Emirates the previous month and BA cannot hold a candle  against them from the warm towels wide seats great entertainment and shiny  new planes. Wont t looking to  fly BA again.
2.0,Miami Florida (MCO)  at London Gatwick  Airport Wed Aug  5 return Sun  Sept 7. We  paid over 150  pounds more for our seats and didn't even get a choice of  what we wanted  in our meal.  in addition the inflight entertainment didn't  exist on our  return trip.
5.0,I have flown LHR-BKK many times with EVA Emirates Oman and Qatar. Unfortunately this time I chose my National carrier. Disappointed is not the word. To start with the seating  layout is absurd. All the others manage 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. BA manages 6 abreast in  a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. When the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. Food - ok  this was a selection on the  flight However at service time I was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. On every Qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. None of  this with BA. Once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. Shabby is not the word. After a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. With no sign of a priority immigration pass being given I asked the steward for one. He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. Stupidly I believed him. Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes. I  return to the UK next week and for the first time ever I am dreading the experience. Never ever will I fly my national carrier again. Disgraceful. It's any Middle  Eastern airline again for me. Qatar  was my preferred choice.
9.0,"LBA-LHR. Checked in  time and boarding  is on my  seat so no  passengers to encounter . Fast track  was average track and the lounge  very busy with  people going to the sunnier climes  so paid for access. Food selection : Hot food  thanks to a self-toasted teacake. Gate near the lounge and quick boarding.  Tickets were in  D and E  but the friendly  lady said 01F  were free so we had the  next row to  board Early departure , swift climb.  Handling was excellent. The Purser addressed us by name  giving us (several)  directions and a choice of snacks , nuts or  fruit (twice) on  the short flight."
1.0,"If there is  any alernative I will never fly  there again. I  use to travel  now and it  is wonderful now it is like  the ""old"" airline.  We flew from  Sydney to London  last summer on  Boeing 747 the  leg room was nt the best  the plane looked tired and I was not impressed. I am disabled  so it is difficult for me  for travel anyway.  As we went  down to Heathrow  I asked for  assistance to get to my gate  as I was  sat in a  line with other  poor people waiting  for our flights.  No one told us that they  do not send you down until your flight is  cancelled due to  illness In that  case we could 've gone and  eaten a meal.  My flight back  to Seattle was  also a B777. The aisles were  cramped and the  seats very narrow.  My am only  disabled but my  knees touched the  seats in front  of me. It  was very difficult  on the people  in the window  and middle seats  could get over me I had  not get up  high into the  air for them  or get out.  Being disabled to  get up and  it is hard  enough in such  a small space  you manoeuvre ones ! When people  in front reclined  it was awful.  the food that  they served was absolutely rubbish. What  happened to the good BA service of a few  years ago. No  more BA for  now if I can help it."
1.0,"Flying British Airways  flight LHR to  the CDG was excellent. I was travelling with an  adult The staff at LHR were  very helpful and  friendly and went out of their way to help me. However it was a very  sad story on  our way back. Everyone in Paris CDG was so  friendly BA made me check-in my  bags which meant I had to  carry a 14month  old boy (15kg) to the gate.  It made my  flight impossible. I pleaded with the  lady at check-in. There was no  problem boarding with  me I will be taking the Eurostar never flying , especially not to Paris."
7.0,"Fly from Jo'burg  - LAX via Heathrow. Both flights  on A380 and  both full. Comfortable  and on time , great service  on the planes.  Only problem is  with Heathrow. At  present excellent arrangements  when boarding the flight - at  an insufficient space  is just chaotic.  Surely Jo'burg can  do it right , BA can get it right at its premium  hub - Heathrow?  Unfortunately when arriving  at Heathrow the  gate to section  1 - where  we landed -  were closed so  we were unable  to transfer direct  from the gates.  So we had  only take the transit to section , go through  the long lines  for security there , then go  directly to section ! No one  told BA or  staff at the  airport gates to  disembark and when  approached by BA  customer service staff  they were uninterested , as usual  supporting BAA rather  not taking responsibility.  Same as the  situation in the  capital and at  both airports is  generally very good."
9.0,LHR-HKG on the  Norwegian A380 in  premium economy and  it was a  great trip staff  were friendly and the food was  really good for a gluten free  flight The only  thing that I  think they could improve on which  it has is  the dedicated check in and boarding  of there flights other than that it was an  enjoyable trip.
10.0,I recently travelled with a friend  through St Lucia  and have to  admit that BA  have once again surpassed my expectations.  The travelling companion and I had  booked World Traveller  Pass and we  was delighted to  have upgraded to Club Class. The cabin crew were  friendly and attentive without being intrusive. We were also upgraded on our  flights and once again the high standards set on the initial journey were matched.
10.0,- Seats booked  in Club World  flight window - so reasonable priced. Check in at  BA very easy  and through the  security track in about 5 mins.  All on time  - short wait before take off.  Dinner on the  DC leg superb  service without being  served food as  not palatable and  another great trip.  Air Seattle -  DC Lounge at  BA is simply  to small with  limited seating however  when on plane staff were again  great although they  seemed little rushed  as compared with the outbound leg  which may simply  be because the  WC cabin was  very full. That  and the high  standards were maintained  and a credit  to the team in the CW cabin. Overall another  great experience when  flying with BA.
9.0,LHR-EDI Used Avios to make short break to Edinburgh. Unlike transatlantic flights  the were plenty of seats on  standby even at short notice and we managed to get onto the flights we wanted.  Both flights were on time (more or less) and both were on new A320 aircraft - bright and airy interiors with plenty of storage space for luggage.  One drink and small bag of nuts while welcome is nothing to get excited about and seems more of a gimmick  now days to distance BA from  the budget airline ! Service levels  both on the plane and on the ground were  excellent throughout and I really enjoyed this domestic service.
1.0,Flew VIE to LHR Club Europe fantastic crew looking after the Club  EU cabin the only let down is the new revamped Club Europe Cabin. I really do not believe  what BA is saying that this  is what their European Passengers want! The seat pitch has now been reduced from 34 inches to 30 inches which used to be the  British Airlines seat pitch years ago. If the passenger in front reclines their seat it is impossible to work on your laptop as there is no room. I really am not able to justify paying the Club Europe Fare for an economy class seat which is the most uncomfortable seat I have ever say in. A number of passengers were not impressed with the new cabin and all felt badly let down by BA. British  Airlines used to  run a class above the rest now they are just an average low cost carrier but still charge the high fares BA really need to think seriously about the Club Europe layout they have added more seats so it is all about money & not about what their passengers really want.
1.0,Third and last  year flying with  Virgin upgraded the  6 of us  into Premium Economy  at £199 each  for 4 of  us a complete  load of money.  Have done this  on Virgin on occasions for long haul flights and its so worth the money and not as expensive.  But terrible crew  and staff not  enough no drinks  and only when  taking out food.  None of us  didnt eat the  meal it was  so bad. On  our 9 hour  journey we were  warned Don't waste  any money upgrading I wish I had read reviews before I left.
1.0,"Fly SYD-SIN and had a reasonably comfortable trip. Problem  being I didn't see much of  any staff in  the economy and they were not very smiley either  pleasant looking. Service definitely down none of the goodies you used to get like snacks , plenty of water. Everyone rather  dull I thought and not helpful. Not my favourite to fly. The  food and seat belt are for  animals not real people."
7.0,"Flying on 9  flights on Boeing  777 aircraft. No queue at check-in , welcoming polite and efficient agent. Priority tag applied to suitcase. Lounge experience at Barajas Terminal 4 was generally positive. Plenty of places to  drink and relax;  good selection of food and drinks with sandwiches some hot food ice cream fruit and a full bar.  The boarding line worked well for business/status passengers. My  biggest gripes are: old aircraft fairly surly crew and a consistent inability  of monitor hand  baggage (I saw  some cases that were larger than the bag I checked in being forced into the overhead lockers). I was in seat  5 which as an exit row seat had plenty of leg room. Full bar service and a chicken tikka flatbread (and vegetarian equivalent) offered.  Parking at Terminal 5B. Bags arrived with minimal (less than 5 minute wait). Overall a decent experience - I will continue to fly with  BA provided seats are available at a good price."
2.0,"Delta LHR-EWR in  Frankfurt Clean aircraft , moderate dysfunction  in armrest foot stool and video screen. We find  BA seating configuration  extremely uncomfortable and will avoid BA when possible. One  passenger spent this flight chatting w.  due to the blockage of aisle  the detriment of  us Dinner was  very horrid (beef)  except for salad and cheese. Late  takeoff and 40  min late arrival , no explanations given."
10.0,Flew London City to Malaga return  31 August and 8th September respectively. Both flights on  board on the wonderful little Embraer  is such a  small plane to  fit in only  4 seats either side of aisle loads of leg room and large  meals Full meal  served in both  planes with cooked  food on the  first flight out and good choice of rice or noodle salads on return lunchtime flight  which is a huge improvement on  those awful sandwiches  they used to  get Return flight made even better by superb approach  from London down  to Thames on  a beautiful sunny  day - would  pay good money  in that part !! Full marks  for everything except had to score  points for 'Inflight ' as there isn't any on this short flight and wouldn't really  use it.
7.0,Travelled YYZ-LHR-ARN and return in mid August. Check in at Pearson was a bit delayed  ( one counter open 2-3 hrs before departure although it is advised that passengers arrive that early). Premium economy cabin inside the Boeing 787 (Dreamliner) is very pleasant and the flight from Toronto to London was very comfortable. Transfer at LHR T5 takes time is something I learned on this trip. 1hr connection is for sure pushing it and you're likely to miss your onward connection with anything less than 1.5 hrs transfer time. We missed our connection  at ARN (our connection was only 1hr) because of the long line ups at the transfer centre. The fact that you go through security again in LHR  takes some time as well. On my way back to Toronto check in at Stockholm's Arlanda Airport was  fast and very smooth. The flight to LHR went fine and I had to spend almost an hour lining up at transfer centre going through security. This is the part of the transfer that for sure takes time. After a train ride to the C gates and a fairly smooth boarding I was onboard the flight to Toronto. I had been upgraded to Business class which was pleasant. Service onboard was professional and courteous. Landing in Toronto was a bit delayed due delayed take off from Heathrow. My overall w BA was good. However transfer in LHR is probably one of the more lengthier ones in Europe I think. I preferred the short transfer at KEF on my last trip to Sweden a few months ago.
1.0,The BA 215 LHR-BOS in economy on an ageing  737 Flight was  20 minutes late taking off. Seat  was uncomfortable and cramped.Meal served was  mostly slop. IFE had glitches but worked eventually. Overhead  seat didn't work. The larger people become and they  travel the less space BA seems to give anyone. The plus point  is the politeness  / professionalism of the cabin staff.
8.0,"8 - IST.  Super efficient as  well no queues  for check in  and security. Proceeded  to the lounge , we relaxed and watched planes take off with glass of champagne.  Service on time , crew friendly , was excellent , of course more champagne! The  only thing that BA need to  address (which I  believe they are).  is to retire  the old aircraft.  Their overall product  is excellent but  I think the  BA crew are let down by  these ageing planes.  ( not personal  thank you etc)."
1.0,Just came back  yesterday morning on a flight from Dubai - BA106.  I was not  happy The cabin crew were just not friendly or  welcoming The plane  was very old and so were the crew tired  or old. It 's like they 've just got the bad bunch a hostesses to manage this flight. BA was so particular before what's happened? The cabin was very hot  and several times  my wife asked about it and  I was just . The food  was very quickly  sold out many  more times people  were missed. I  had to ask  about water a  couple of times. There was no  air warmth. It  is really like  sitting on a  first class air lines. I'd love to fly BA  or support them but this is  disappointing I would not recommended this . Next time  you are flying eremites. Pay the extra. BTW I  think a number  that other people have complained about  BA crew on  this site too  it seems consistently  rude
7.0,Flew Heathrow to Lyon return. Late  arrivals on the  flight out but made up all  but 10 mins  off the time. Catering hardly worth  any effort as comprised unappetising looking sandwich and one  beer (not even  tea or coffee on the outbound).  Very good and check in very good especially at  midday
5.0,"Overall Excellent outbound ! Tasty food  and wine very  nice cabin crew  and the entertainment  system isn't up  too much in  favor of choice.  Same story on  our way back . Stand-offish cabin crew and no  more champagne. Rose  translates as ""we 've been fully "". Not a  good thing but  indicative of how  badly shod BA  must sometimes be  those days. The  bed is comfortable . I slept  half the way back rather than try their food  & drink."
1.0,"London to Budapest  in Club World-now  please don't even mention the fact that my luggage hasn't arrived but the price for club world is a huge rip off! You can sit in the  old ""slimline"" type  a seat-which is thinner than the previous ones and some genius obviously thought that if they put in thinner seats why not squeeze in another 2 extra rows which means that the leg space is less  that half as it was in  the old days - so exactly like in economy . So you  pay 300 dollars more for 3 stale finger sandwich and a scone - what a bargain! Shame on you BA for  the lousy service.  I never fly  to them again."
8.0,I flew Premium Economy on BA  to Boston to  Dubai then London  and Johannesburg. The  beds were comfortable and the leg room was ample enough even for an over 6  foot passenger. The  flight attendants were  extremely attentive. Having  flown Air France  Premium economy in  January 2013 I must say that the BA Premium Economy is much  nicer than that  in the French  airline It was  certainly worth the  extra money.
4.0,That was the first long-haul flight I'd taken for 20 years and  had had high  expectations that our London-Cape Town flight would be far  more comfortable and pleasant than the  various carriers we've used for European  trips Boy was I wrong -  seats were squeezed in so tightly  is was almost impossible to get  out without injuring the poor person  in the aisle  seat and when  the person in front reclined her seat my daughter could hardly move - we had to ask a flight attendant to  make the person put their seat upright so that we could eat  separate meals. Even worse - I actually paid extra  and choose our  flight in advance thinking that a window and centre seat wouldn't be  too bad. Come on British Airways ! I know that at the moment they are  our only airline offering a direct LHR-Cape Town service  but they can do better than that.
9.0,"Economy class on 28 Aug from London (LHR) to New York (JFK).  Seat was in  row 5 which I love as I can sit Gatwick - Orlando  and Gatwick. Club  seats both ways.  - Worth the money every penny  worth it. Crew  for the outbound sector were fairly young and were  a little rude  acting like everything was a chore.  When you asked for something they  all got on the cart you  would have it.  Friendly enough but  were really interested  about the passengers.  The inbound not  so disrespectful but they were older and much nicer.  There was too  little bother. If  we hadn't got  in there and  asked they got  it right away  from you. Lie-flat beds comfortable enough . baggage allowance . 3 bags per passenger is  good for the shopping. Food and  drinks are good however I do think the food on Thomson Airways  at premium is  cheaper than BA 's world. In  term of scheduled  seats British Airways are ten times  bigger than Virgin  and so many  flights and would fly with BA , no questions ..."
1.0,I'm regularly flying  Hong Kong-London-Port of  London these days.  London to London is via Cathay  - business class  which is excellent.  If I then  had to swap to BA for London to Trinidad  to 'Club World'  – a euphemism  of 'slum in  blue sky'. Cathay  Pacific business class seats - 4 across the width  of the aircraft. BA Club Slum - 8 across. If you're on a night flight  it means tripping  up people or  getting tripped over. Decor is abysmal  food is average to poor. Seat  and personal space  selection is lousy  - but there's  too much space  too work with.  Food choice is  limited and the  small screen is tiny and reminiscent  to old analogue 625 lines TVs  in the 80s. The overall impression  is a dreary  living space with minimal storage crummy  above average food and indifferent service. Don't do it! Fly with someone else - anyone else!
6.0,Travelled LHR to Montreal 21st August  2013 and Montreal to LHR 1st September 2014. Aircraft  service was a  7 with 4 classes. This sector  does not normally offer a First  Class so business class passengers were  dispersed throughout the First and Club  Class cabins. All  flights were on time and the  flight crew were  friendly especially on the outward leg. Check in and baggage reclaim were smooth and efficient.  Passenger lounges at  cabin 5 are  very tired and were rather dirty when we used them. Food choice was limited although I did enjoy the hot soup.  Technology in BA is dated and even BA's new  Economy Class seat is rather disappointing  as compared to  some business class  premium carries such  a Emirates or . Food is  way below par both in terms of quality and  price I know BA is struggling  to make ends  met but ultimately it has to  understand that people paying for premium  services expect a certain experience and the seat and food make up  a major element of that experience. I guess there is little competition  from BA on the north Atlantic routes but it helps to explain why their share  in routes to the Far East  and Australia are diminishing.
5.0,Booked a British Airways holiday so that's flight and hotel from London City Airport to Florence Peretola Airport. Either it came  directly from the BA Rep. or my husband asked about an upgrade to Business Class and was told  it would be an extra £300 for the return trip. As it was for a significant birthday he thought why not. Reasons why no-one should bother with this upgrade for  this particular flight. 1) No separate BA lounge at either London City  or Peretola Airports. 2) Faster boarding? Entirely pointless when  you all have to get onto a bus to take you to the aeroplane at Florence. 3) Bigger  cabin and more  leg room? They are small planes so the same throughout. 4) Luggage  arrives first? No point when it takes over an hour to get through customs at Florence. 5) Better meal? Yes choice of meat or fish. Very nice but worth £75 each? The BA Rep should have told us about the lack of facilities and suggest  a hotel upgrade instead. It was a perfectly pleasant flight the holiday was great but we paid an extra £300 for no reason whatsoever.
1.0,What will they . I flew BA to Dubai  last Friday in business. Let me sum it up. Boring food surly crew dirty plane  very expensive. Can the product get any more unimaginative.  My inflight entertainment  was out of touch with modern media the screen so poor I couldn't see the movie and gave up. The sandwiches that you get when you land are so awful that I think any frequent flyer  is awfully fed  up with them the crew make you feel that  they are in  their way and the plane is (again) horribly dirty.  Food was spilt  on all the wipeable areas around  my seat. In business you expect  that It is just not an enjoyable or fun experience by any means and they never upgrade you or take care of their frequent flyers. When I can I chose  a different airline.
2.0,"I flew BA  flights to Grenada , first time  flying BA and  Virgin due to  me having been dedicated Virgin customers.  Finally upgraded to ""Premium Economy"" and  upgraded from the  only leg room  available for hubby , no odds  against me at  all No benefit , total waste  of money at almost double cost  of upgrading with Virgin! Service was not great and  drink was awful , ""welcome on "" drink in  the Economy was  orange juice in  a plastic carton.  BA offers orange juice or champagne  in a glass. No idea what  food was on offer as no menu provided and  only a disgruntled ""chicken or beef""  response when asked ? Old and  cramped plane very  old TVs. First  & last time  holiday with BA  but will change  point of holiday in future to  take Virgin flight.  Sadly this over-priced  airline didn't even  compare with Virgin's  premium service. I  very strongly recommend  you waste your  savings or better still go with Virgin."
1.0,I flew indirect  between Orlando and  London - although the Miami/Orlando Orlando/Dallas  and Dallas/London flights were with American Airlines (BA partners).  A BA flight  home was an  okay plane -  cabin staff were great and food  good but the  light entertainment was poor. Your own  entertainment but no  entertainment over the  flights which all ran at different times. Having only flown Virgin and  Delta long haul BA rated way  worse in all ! But that was nothing compared to the 737-300 we flew on with American Airlines  - Dallas to London (BA 1531).  You understand they  were upgrading their fleet and I can see why  having flown on  the old plane we were unfortunate  enough to fly on. The first  10 mins the  aircraft stank like  the toilet to  that extent that the level of complaints and people standing in protest  during take off. The inflight entertainment was a joke - a poor quality shared screen  with 30 others two films and  no choice. The crew were the unfriendliest I have ever encountered -  zero meet and greet or goodbyes.  You thought booking through BA would ensure some level of quality and that they would  offer a certain level of quality  with their partners but unfortunately not.  The worst flight  ever (we are  a family of five) and I  will not be flying BA again.
9.0,LHR-PHL on a  new Dreamliner seat 3K. I recommend  the 3K 3A 7A and 7K as you get aisle access and no other passengers have to climb  on your feet when they leave their seat. The seat does feel a little claustrophobic compared to the  lower deck of the 747 but it's very comfortable. The service was  always provided by an all male crew. The food quality has improved and so has the menu choices. The entertainment system is excellent as it's the Thales version on the 787 so the  seats are bigger and the picture quality is better. The aircraft is also very quiet and the windows are a gimmick as you dim the windows rather than using the  power blind.
4.0,"Travelled with BA  via Rome to  Italy Staff at Rome were wonderful what a contrast to Heathrow. Entirely through my own  bag I left my passport on  a plane. When I asked for assistance three members of staff at the ""Helpdesk"" did anything but help. In itself this  may not seem  unusual having got  myself into this  mess but when they did finally deign to speak to me they told me the plane had left. I pointed out that the plane  stood still outside  our terminal building. Their response was  simply ignore me. I finally found one very polite , well informed , kind person  that did help. He was a  passport collector!"
10.0,"Great return. Very  good check-in at  JFK let down  and slow fast track (but that's  the airports fault).  In gate lounge quiet nice refreshments-I  still think the  best games consoles  have worked in  the entire time T5 has been open. Short walk  through boarding full  flight left slightly early landed well  out of schedule.  All excellent worked  out throughout. Decent  food as well , Entertainment out  of new system  and older system  is not as  good and screen  not in best  condition Return flight  all comments pretty  positive except my  home video system  didnt work on  the back so  I just let  them sit in  case Keep it up BA."
7.0,"BKK-LHR-EDI-LHR-BKK Outbound flight up to standard but not above  & beyond but this is standard  on BA which cannot compare with the top tier airlines. Return flights similar. Faults lay in ground services at EDI and T5 in LHR the latter overcrowded and rather scruffy. Return flight had no magazines (""they  forget to load"")  and individual bottled  bottles (""they forgot  TO load""). Have a need to return to UK  but will try an alternative (which is a night flight). Why did BA stop night flights last autumn?"
2.0,LGW-MCO-LGW 11-25th August Economy Class. Got to the gate lounge to be told our seats  has been reallocated to another seat this was the reason why - it was because there was a big family party that didn't want to separate - considering I paid a lot of money for my family to sit all together. Got  back to the  airport thinking it would be the same as Virgin Atlantic but no it wasn't it was an old plane tatty one as well. Food and drinks were limited on the whole 9 hour  journey no snacks on board. The food was limited and when we got ours the people in front decide to recline there chairs in front so within that we have told hold our dinners luckily we  didnt get burnt. Well sorry BA next time I am flying with .
10.0,I return 19th/26th . Economy 2  adults 2 children.  Good experience from Check In to  landing in Faro . As a  frequent traveller on  the route have  not got used  using the ex  standard airbuses on  this route the seating is perfectly  comfortable despite the  low seat pitch  and have never  encountered any problems  from requesting more  that one drink  on the flight.  The crew were  excellent in both  flights and were  extremely service orientated  right start to  start Only one  major issue and  that is the  only one toilet  in the rear  of the whole  aircraft cabin!
3.0," I have flown twice with BA  Airlines in business class (to and  from Delhi) and  we have to  confess it has  gone absolutely poor!  Me and a  dozen colleagues flew  down to New  Zealand for a  business trip. BA  is the pioneers of aircraft's after  everything they did  on The Concorde.  The word in  aviation is ""were""  and basically turned  to a no  good airline. Allow  myself to explain:  a blue worn  and padded fabric  covered with stains  worn out grey plastic panels with  tiny grains of  sand and dirt  cut into and  out TFT which had the same  film quality as  Scotch tape! The  plane looks like  something was directly  taken out of  the 1980 film . You still  have the odd  bump on the  aisle when economy  customers are boarding  your plane with  no luggage as  there is no  leg space! Staff  are fine but  for business class  every customer should  expect a wow factor - and there was none.  A plastic translucent  screen that divides the seats had  become battered from  being shifted up  & down when  cabin crew serve  them food and  beverages The toilets  are exactly the  opposite as economy  but in Business  class they stick  a plastic flower  into a glass.  Their food was  good but again  no special. Normally  its the little  touches that make  big differences but  with BA they 're a total  make over. For  a flight that  runs everyday from  London to Delhi BA should be  doing more. The decor of the  cabin matched the  seats I got . BA dull. I won't be  travelling long haul  on them again.  Only advice -  use BA and  if you book  other flights have  your look online  for what other  carriers can offer ."
9.0,"Fly from London  to Doha on  BA newly refurbished  BA Smooth ride  into airport and  friendly staff on  hand to help. Boarding was on time but there was a slight  storm which put  it back by  about an hour and delayed take off. Captain was  excellent at keeping us informed. Cabin Crew friendly enough but seemed tired  with their service and no smile. Food was average , not anything  to write home  but I felt  I had to eat quickly as  the flight attendant  was waiting for  me to finish my last bite with a stern look! Inflight entertainment was excellent and  keep me entertained throughout the six  and you have got an array  on movies TV  Shows and Music to choose from.  We were really comfy and I  had a good kip. Overall an enjoyable experience and I would definitely  use BA again."
3.0,Welcome to LHR:  Boeing 777 (Economy).  We just returned from a family holiday in the USA and flew  to Economy. The flight was slightly delayed but most  said this delay  is made up during the journey.  People were pleasant and the IFE was fine. However the food was  terrible Main meal  with a choice of Chicken Curry and Rice or a Veggie Pasta. Breakfast before landing  is a cold  meal consisting of  1 Croissant bag of Cranberries and  some Granola Bar. What has happened  between the 2 meat choices? (Veggies choose veggie option  on advance) and a cooked breakfast? BA have a  UK flag on the tail but do not serve any British food. I'm a Silver  Label Club member and food on BA has been  horrendous over the last couple of years. I've made several complaints.
7.0,"From LHR to Muscat return in Club World on a 777-200 (G-ZZZA). Loyal BA customers  who have flown Club World many  see BA long haul fleet starting to show it's age cabins looking  that bit old and some of the equipment not  working as it  should On our  flight my TV  could not stay  in position and  was falling back into it's default position (and therefore  not viewable). Had to stuff some coffer cup protectors  under the pivot  plate to keep it in place. This is not the type of quality you expect when you are paying several thousand for your flights.  Maintenance and service  are good as  well BA need to make sure , they inspect and make sure that everything works in the Clud cabin every trip!  When you paying  the sort of money a club  world first ticket costs you expect  everything to be perfect. Agee with  some comments about  the World layout it is starting  to annoy me  bending over someone's legs to get out to use  their toilet! Generally  I think BA is a good  looking product but haven't tried Emirates Qatar etc. yet!"
6.0,Economy class on 28 Aug from London (LHR) to New York (JFK). Boarding was in Terminal 5 which I love as I can sit for some time in Caffe Nero  for a coffee and watch airplanes  take off or land. I choose BA just because  of their Terminal . Boarding went quite smoothly and the flight was full. It took about 40 minutes till we actually took off after  whatever time we were supposed to. The seat I had wasn't comfortable the cushion was moving and the seat wasn't firm. The inflight entertainment  had a limited choices of movies which was disappointing and the screens  seemed small and sometimes were not working. Flight attendants were all women who were polite and smiling they  did their best to make it a pleasurable flight. Toilets were clean. The headphones were broken and I had to ask for new ones. We landed on time. It took 15 minutes till the plane could park and then another 30 minutes to get off because as the captain informed us there was a long line at immigration and we  will have to wait for them to give us the go ahead. Inside Terminal 7 there was a  long line it  takes 2.5 hours to finally reach  immigration officer. This was by far the most annoying  and tiring experience I have had. To land at 10.45pm and get out at 2am is just too much. I will now choose an airline that lands in a terminal which can handle large numbers of passengers more effectively.
6.0,"BA15 LHR to SIN B777-300ER First Class: nice a (four months old) but a few signs of wear already. The seat (2K) was reasonably private and reasonably quiet. Useful wardrobe with enough space  to put various items and shoes but the seat has almost no other storage space. Things have to be left loose in the foot-well area. Footrest doubles as a buddy seat although his would be rather cramped I'd imagine. Seat itself fine and comfortable. Good enough to get reasonable sleep on a 12hr journey.  The lighting and temperature perfect. View of outside restricted by the angle of the seat - just when it is interesting (t/off and landing) you are strapped in and cannot see all the fun outside - the child in me I guess! Food and service excellent. The toilets , wow - a flimsy concertina door poor water supply into small bowl so not really good for brushing teeth. Middle-eastern airlines are so much better - BA really has to re-think. Overall BA First Class is equivalent to  Boeing Business class. Cabin crew very attentive - if only they had a better product to work with."
1.0,"Travelled as a family of four to the Maldives. Despite numerous requests  from weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. The plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. This seems to be an issue on BA routes with little competition it was  very similar story when we flew  business to Mauritius. On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience  showed many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are  paid this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment  that keep them occupied. They don't  have the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old  son who normally  ate everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed  to be a  system to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut  down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so  busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. On the return trip service  went a little  worse and well below standards you should expect. Food was equivalently poor. This is the second BA business class trip I've taken to the Maldives and each time I have been disappointed given the cost. I've also travelled economy on Emirates to Male which was actually better and business on Emirates which was fantastic. I know BA have monopoly on the direct route from Gatwick to Male but I will be going  into Dubai on Emirates in future."
10.0,380 and ORD-LHR.  The crew on  the flights. The new aircraft are  excellent although I  prefer the 777-300ER  to the A380 as the journey  is more comfortable  having more legroom at the back  than the 777.  I really have upped their game and would happily  work with them again in the future.
8.0,I flew from Singapore to Heathrow on a B747 which is certainly an ageing aircraft that showed its age. I think this is one  the BA's main let-downs. The inflight  cinema was slightly  disappointing There wasn't a single movie that I fancied but then I  think everyone has  their tastes. I did listen to some music though. The service on board was generally  excellent at least on the side  on the aircraft I was on.  A stewardess who served was very  nice and attentive.  My food was good although I got a sense that something was missing from the meal overall. It wasn't highly appealing. I also find  these seats comfortable they are softer  than those on Singapore Airlines. I slept very well and I'm not usually one to sleep particularly well on flights. BA can certainly improve  on some aspects but overall I have found them a pleasure to  fly with.
9.0,Fri 20 Aug  2018 TO BRI.  I checked in  early so only  needed to drop  bag and clear security. Wrong what  an chaotic system  they were running.  Those who checked  in online had  to wait in a very long  line to simply  have their bags  scanned and sent  in their way  via a member of BA staff. If this is  the case then  just get all  these counters working and clear the  queues quickly. Pity  those poor people who squeezed their  tickets to the  security check in  and bag tagged  checked bags only  to be told  to join the  security line. I can not understand  if the system  are supposed to  be more efficient.  We then had  the situation of  the staff dragging  people out of  their line as  some were going  to miss their  bags Even the  very nice BA  crew member who did our bag tags could not  explain what went  on Flight was  late on boarding  as to flight  coming in late.  Any issue with  staff or the  people on board all very helpful.  We have a  bag and wrap  which was very  glad Captain kept  us informed of  the delay and  plane landed 30  minutes late and he did apologise  again for late  flight Please Gatwick  can sort out check in.
8.0,Flight Checked in  about 10.00am for  a 13.10 departure.  check in was  good Then proceeded  into Fast Track which was not ! The lounge  was quite busy  and the staff  were very helpful.  No on time  meals before take off were offered ! We were  at the new  terminal so the  bathroom was nice  but clean. I  stayed in 1F.  I converted into  the flat bed  that was good. About 20 mins  into the flight  our drinks run  me through. When  seated we asked  us what we  are having for  lunch I choose  The Salmon for  breakfast which was  good For mains  I choose the chicken option which  tasted good but  my veg was  very hard. Finally  we choose the ice cream for  lunch Landed on  time and got  the bags quickly.
3.0,I flew from London to Sydney Club World /  Business Class. Having done similar OZ flights recently with Qatar Airlines the experience was like  visiting the Premium  or Third Division  flight clubs. Everything  with BA was  very shabby and second rate -  so sad. Numerous  perks from the Business Lounge the  check out of the cabin the comfort of the seats privacy food  service - all  first rate. And for about £2  each extra flight . Why? I  will seriously consider flying to Sydney  from Perth next time - longer  term an experience where you arrive feeling caressed not bundled along. Really  bothers me to say this - a very poor way to present  your country's airline.
4.0,Friday 15th August  2017 In my mind that when  we bought the  cheapest tickets it  will be a  better flight experience  based on their  credentials as a  4 star airline.  That turned out  it be totally  opposite I used  to travel with  many airlines it  appears that my flight experience with  them from Changi  airport to Heathrow was the worst  of so many . Not worth  money spent at . Firstly the seat space was really small (I  cannot imagine those  that are bigger  than I am  but I am  of medium size ). Secondly the  amount of food  service was not  great in comparison  to other airlines.  We only served  food twice for  my 12 hour  short haul journey.  While the service  I considered moderate  and it seemed  to no one  complained about the  food in economy  class (no one  wanted to top  off the toilet .) Lastly the  home entertainment was  really back dated.  My movies selection  may have been  30 years old.  Micro earphones and  LCD screens. All  In all an  average customer.
7.0,"Back to Gatwick. This flight seems to be late on a regular basis. Three times  one hour late , once two hours late this summer of the  four times I was involved. Seems the summer schedule is very optimistic Check-in at Bari 's hopeless always  late and 'bag drop' seems to be used by travellers with ticketing problems. Boarding is poor regularly left  you wait in  the hot air bridge between the gate and the plane. None of this done by BA staff but they are doing BA's reputation no good seemingly using the level of service expected with the low cost carriers that also go to London. Onboard though is always good despite the age of the planes. Fair choice of drinks and a good sandwich nice crew. My flight ended with a 50 minute wait for luggage. A lot for BA to address here."
4.0,Off to Cancun  to club world  championship in July.  A plane which  we think BA  ran out of ? Food -  I can't understand how they can  make it so ? We flew  an upperclass to  Barcelona but had  better use BA this year due  to date's will  not use BA 's Cabin crew  - too bad  it could be  worse Save your  money or go  to Virgin.
10.0,"Flight BA458/463 out  of A319 G-EUOE and return on B763 G-BZHB excellent flights both ways. The cabin service was very good , I got the seating as requested nice refurbished  cabin on the  return journey. Definitely  good choice of  seats"
9.0,"Delta B777-200ER BA0108  - 18 First  Class Transferred from  the Emirates flight  at DXB. BA  Premium Galleries Lounge  and staff member . Boarding reasonable  with an on-time departure. Cabin crew  friendly and definitely  living up to  their ""To Fly.  To Serve"" BA . Food tasty  but well presented  although not quite  First Class and  this was evident.  BA New First  Class is comfortable though the footrest  was poorly designed  as a storage  area for small ish items is . IFE monitor controls and selection  are good but  this screen could  have more adjustable  to reach. Lovely  interior ambience including  soft textures mood  curtains and window blinds. Toilets cramped  and stocked with  their cheapest liquid  soap and toilet paper. Overall an  excellent flight but as a longstanding  but very loyal BA customer (Gold ), I ask  if they seriously  consider improving their  experience in an  extremely competitive market.  Had a little  help at LHR , remote stand disembarking and bus  transfer to T5."
7.0,We flew from Gatwick to Rome  and back on holiday and was  pleasantly surprised by  their standard of  hospitality and service.  The salad on  my outward flight  was exceptional and  a steward on  the return leg  (= a near-full cabin) was anticipating  other passengers might  order BA food  like me. I've flown First a few times in the past few  weeks and the  service was so  bad I thought  we should pay compensation as well as refunding the  original ticket. In  Rome it is usually OK. The  only letdown this  year was the  security at Gatwick.  It was like  a Ryanair holding pen.
1.0,Friday 28th July flew from Edinburgh  for Gatwick. Flight  was delayed 3  times as it  has been hit  in lightening on  this flight this  I accepted but what happened afterwards means I will never use them  again 1) Information or details of  anything was happening had to bedraggled out of them. 2) At no  stage was any  help offered. 3)  This flight was  also delayed to  encourage people to  go back onto this flight when they choose to be transferred to a later flight  rather than wait  to see what  is happening this lead to a further delay of 1 hour. 4) No breakfast or snack was served for health and safety reasons. 5)  As they stated  we would be well hydrated during the flight only one drink service  were provided this  consisted of 4 fluid oz cup  cold water between  1 and 2.30pm. 6 They then  offered to leave our luggage at  customs while we travelled to Gatwick.  6 After giving  them the run around for an  hour and a  bit they then  tried to tell  passengers they could not track our  luggage 8) It then took them  2 days to  collect them and send them from  London to Gatwick. Would I use again or recommend  again never in  the month of  September
7.0,"We flew from Munich to Boston  via Heathrow T5  in August 2014):  Munich to Heathrow , flight out of Munich at  midnight The flight  looked good leaving on time but  due to flight  crew arriving from  London the night , so we  could not get breakfast served on  economy class. From  the T5 to Boston as the  food was nice , the business seat was OK  and special in  compared to other  flights like Iberia , which is much nicer. The cabin crew was nice and friendly  which was nice as I have  had to have  a salad instead  of hot meal.  We managed to  have a good  conversation all the  way to Boston after the meal."
8.0,Flight Club World.  Had 400 GBP  flights from Prem  in a day . T5 lounge  very positive -  good selection of  food which was  properly labelled. Had a treatment -  facial massage and  cabin staff were  very attentive. Dreamliner  is a great way to fly - although delayed half an hour  way ahead of time. Felt relaxed  being addressed by name throughout and  cabin crew was  friendly and yes . Two hot  food services and  a multi course  lunch was served  without fuss. Not  worried about the  checked bag- although it is more  comfortable to carry . Entertainment options are excellent. Baggage  sorted for me  on carousel. Good flight for BA.
5.0,"Day 56 JNB-LHR , August 2014 Business class A380  upper deck. The flight did not  live up to  expectations Too many seats makes business  level cabin look  too narrow seats  on each row  and in opposite  direction no problem  about this but this impedes free  access for some of the seats specially the ones  at the middle  and window side also not much  room for storage  of personal items like specs etc.  The window blinds  for this section  or upper deck were kept lowered  for the entire  2 hr flight  with no cue  of any outside  light whatsoever until we landed at  Newark and parked  on the stand , like sitting  on a light proof box with artificial illumination. I  suppose you need  not keep the  curtains open for  approach and take off? The 747 business class is  less comfortable than A380."
1.0,"We paid £2500  to upgrade to world traveller plus  after we got  a departure lounge , were upgraded  to business class  BA was brilliant , air hostess  was a point  in letting us  know plus other  things that we had a free  seat On the  whole journey in  world traveller plus  a happy table broken and air  stewards very sarcastic  or very bad  air stewards seemed  unsure if they were doing you  no favour. Paid  a lot of  cash to fly  in Maldives have no choice to  ask BA to go direct stewards , or female  and to remember  that we are  just paying a lot of money  on a service."
3.0,"I flew London  and Beijing in  the World on  BA on Aug . The cabin  is a disgrace. I sat in  a upper deck  in 62A and  what worried me  was the filthy , the metallic looking tape on  the emergency exit  doors and the foam strip that was hanging down. In addition the  toilets and lockers  were filthy inside.  Prices and service  were excellent but  I will vote  for my wallet and boycott BA  From now on  when possible."
6.0,"Flight Club Europe. Travelled with hand baggage only given the well publicised  issue with Swissport  the handling at  JFK Outbound flight  this was BA  at its best.  On time departure (a rarity it seems at LGW for BA) A320  in fair condition , additional leg room in Club  Europe and two  extra flight attendants.  Flight return (22/7/2014)  had a different . Probably my  favourite BA flight !! Delayed departure  at TFS though  only about 10 minutes late in arrival at LGW.  Two additional leg room on this  trip in Club  Europe Lazy cabin crew who did the bare minimum with limited grace. And screaming infants  out of control toddlers and ignorant  teenagers in the  Club Europe cabin  is not the airline's fault but  it could have  and should have  been more to  handle the situation. One example -  two teenagers in  seat 1 immediately  pushed their seats into the faces  of the couple  in front of  them after take . The cabin crew didn't even  let the teenagers  to their seats  for the meal ! All credit  goes the couple  on front of us though. They had the manners  NOT to recline  the seats into  the faces. The  extra premium to  fly Club Europe  was just not  cutting it when  these people's children  are not controlled and the promised  passengers 'personal space'  was not provided.  Below are an average of both flights: outbound top  five across the board (bar entertainment  that was none)  - I would have preferred to  see zero."
7.0,18 August 2014  London to Orlando flight details and departure went well. However when the  food was served on the flight  it was limited  either chicken or  pork which was  fine until they ran out and then could only offer the veggie option which was  vegetarian which my Father in Law doesn't eat so he ended up with 2 bread s as his . This was served within the  second hour of our over 8 hour flight and  about 7 hours later we were served a snack  but only had one option coronation chicken (chicken again!) which only 2 in our party of 6 liked. Again my Father in Law had nothing as he was 1 of the 4. Pretty  amazing show British Airways as we travelled with Virgin to Mexico in  July this year  first class and they offered a menu with three  options for lunch/dinner  and enough for everyone! Again when the snack was served option were given and enough  for all. Virgin also provided a very good entertainment system with up to date films TV and games which was something  we need on a long journey again BA was  not able to provide. BA your  products are definitely  giving more value  than our money! I wouldn't not  use BA again as I don't like to limit  our choices however  i would definitely  continue to fly Virgin in future. In my opinion all flights should have enough food  for all of their passengers and look at what  you are offering as coronation chicken didn't go down well with a large number of passengers what's happened  too good old ham or cheese?
2.0,We flew the  airplane from LAX-LHR-JNB-LHR-LAX in August 2014 in business class. This plane was  made by someone who never flew it. The seats are so close together with no room on the window side to get out when  the seats are flat. A person has to put up the foot rest for a  seat to stand and then step over the person next to them to get out into the aisle. In addition the person on the window seat gets  only the food handed to them in front of the face of the person on the aisle. They have put so many people in  each row that the seats are very narrow. There is virtually no place ( a small drawer at the seat) for personal items to be used during  a flight without getting out of the seat to get something from the overhead.
8.0,My journey was  between BOM to  Dubai (I had  another connecting flight  from LHR to MIA surprisingly enough the transit at  all wasn't all  to bad). Aircraft : Got a  big upgrade from World Traveler to  International Traveler Plus.  Every seat was  spacious and spacious service was professional  and the food  very nice especially the English breakfast that was served  prior to landing.  Only only drawback  were the absence of overhead air  conditioning which at times made it  seem little stuffy and the in-flight  menu which lacked the variety of Emirates for example.  Was a pleasant  flight Wouldn't mind  going with BA  flights at all.
3.0,Sad to say BA missed a big opportunity when  the new 787 and A380 entered ! Same old sub standard business class seating as on the retired 747s. Compared to  other airlines the BA premium service is poor and I don't know how they keep a 4 star ! The cabin crew were excellent though I will concede. Food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was  coated in grease (laughingly referred to as jus) which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to  create a disgusting . The 787 was good and BA have improved their IFE system  the screens are small and have to be stowed for take off and landing unlike  those in economy and premium. Pay more get less.
10.0,"We flew from LHR to Luxembourg  in an afternoon flight we enjoyed  very delicious afternoon tea and champagne because it was my husbands birthday. Flight attendants very  friendly and jolly  and felt very much as if we were having a really nice  little celebration up  in the sky!  Tickets received very quickly on both flights. We travelled  back in economy , it was really good with  drinks and a  salad or crisps. Only problem was that there was no place for  the aircraft to  load up when  it got in  due to bad weather. We were off as quickly as they could so it wasn't  so bad!"
4.0,I was on BA 835 from Dublin to LHR  on 25th July 2014 which left Dublin at 13.05 and my travel  arrangements were such that I had sufficient time to connect with my  passengers from LHR to Hong Kong.  Upon leaving Dublin the pilot opined that it was  another good day  for fly! On reaching LHR we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to  have diverted to Gatwick and were running out of fuel. In summary we sat on the tarmac at  BA for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for LHR and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. On reaching LHR BA staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real  consideration for those passengers on connecting flights. I was lucky as I managed to get on my flight to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific but with only  minutes to spare after a dash to terminal 3. Whilst I understand the volatility of the weather the real point of my review is  how BA appears  too have abandoned the basics of customer service and this is clearly reflected in BA's absence in the top 10 airline ratings. Could do a lot better!
9.0,Flight BA 937 Dusseldorf to London  on 13th March . BA 932  Berlin to Dusseldorf  on 15th March.  All flights served  on Airbus A319.  Plane was in  very good shape  the pitch 34 inch and the  tail 17 inch.  Service in DUS I owned Lounge) is quite nice but nothing special  outside of BA  747 LHR T5  looked very good  and a lot of space even it was very  full at this time but anyway  we know it  from other times when it was  not empty. No check-in because of  the luggage only.  flight 937 was delayed for about  an hour due  of foggy weather  over London so the very nice  staff start to  offer Drinks to  reduce the waiting  while on ground.  Food served after  breakfast a choice  between a cold  salad with assorted  vegetables and meat  on bread/rolls or  the warm cheese  with ham croissant  and salad. Drinks  including Champagne were  served twice. More  drinks for that  relatively short flight.  Wait for BA  flights (bought liquids)  and T5 was  really quick also friendly staff. BA  Lounge as I wrote was busy but worth it to reduce waiting  time Very nice  flight attendants drinks  ordered 3 times  and Dinner with mixed salad. No  TV Inflight Entertainment  as on most  BA Flights) small  screens with flight information.
8.0,Heathrow to Newark  on 787. Flight  very pleasant and  efficient Left Heathrow 1 hour late  but arrived on  time Seat was  great and food  were ok. Service was excellent but had to walk  back in the  rain to catch a bus to  get us to  the plane. Would recommend BA due  to service and Heathrow T5.
8.0,Sunday Aug 8th LHR-HKK. Club World. Upper deck. Overall  very good flight. The service was a bit robotic. Pre- departure drinks offered. Main and breakfast served. For the main course I opted for the healthy /  light meal which was tasty and just what I  needed as I was trying to avoid a heavy  meal before bed. I was surprised  at the limited wine selection: Two whites and two reds. I had a NZ Sauv Blanc which was tasty but 'connoisseurs' may have felt restricted by choice. The staff were overall very pleasant and happy to help when asked but just weren't pro-active. Passengers (myself included) were having to ask for things that should have been attended to without request. They seemed 5  minutes too slow for drink rounds meal service etc. This is a small complaint however as I managed a solid 7  nights of sleep and the overall  sleep was good. The entertainment system on the A380 is much improved and is as good as any I have flown VSSG etc. The window seat is certainly more private and feels much more spacious with the storage compartments under the windows and I would recommend these - especially over middle ! All in all a solid  first class but still lagging behind the likes of CX or SG primarily because of  weight and seat layout. There is a 'Britishness' to the product which still makes me smile.
1.0,"June 25th 2014. My wife and daughter boarded in Boston. The door  was closed and we were ready to depart for  home Then a  water cart hit the airplane. We deplaned and that  is understandable. After an hour we  got told the plane would not depart and there was no room on any other planes for days.  Contact your friends - make your own arrangements!"" was the only customer relations help offered by British Airways. The BA help on the ground said there were no hotels on vouchers. I really  really really thought British Airways was the standard of air travel. If you have any alternative do not book British Airways.  Sounds great as  long as everything 's going as planned. If anything goes wrong they  are a confused people who have no idea how to help you."
10.0,Flew Sydney - Singapore - London return. Thoroughly enjoyed both flights good  & good service. Would definitely use  January 2015 for  the flight to Oslo. Thank you  British Airways.
9.0,Boston - Houston - LHR. Two of us travelled using Avios and Amex companion voucher. Excellent cabin crew on both sectors  with good selection of wine and  food pretty decent particularly outbound. The staff in Houston even found and  repaired my iPod which I had  put on the aircraft on the outbound sector.
3.0,Flight LHR-YYZ BA97 on 9 July returning BA96 28July. Check-in at LHR an absolute breeze including security which took only 5 minutes. Galleries Lounge at the south end of T5 awful with poor food dirty furniture and smelly toilets. Outbound aircraft was G-BNLG surely one of the most ancient 747s in existence judging by the state of the interior at least in the main cabin. On boarding all the window shades were down (10.20 departure) and stayed down for the entire flight including take-off  or landing most peculiar. The head cabin service person said it was  because keep the  light out - I have questioned if this is a new BA policy for daytime flights. Departed and arrived a few minute late no issue. Food and  service very average as usual nowhere near the standards of international Business Class elsewhere. Immigration and baggage delivery in YYZ very swift. For the return again the  visa formalities were quick and painless ; the lounge  at Pearson is ok but nothing special. Aircraft this time was G-BGYC the upper deck was in reasonable condition although as always with BA's Club World seating  their is little stowage space and the whole backwards/forwards concept is something I personally dislike. Food almost non-existent on this 2310 departure and most people slept: this would be understandable if a proper  meal was on offer. Unfortunately it was no better than going to McDonalds with some unripe fruit and a sort of egg and bacon muffin - just awful. Also the person in the window seat did have something to eat and drink and every time the crew member came with his orders he would lower the partition to pass them through with all the disturbance that creates. Is this service policy poor seat design or  bad crew? Flight  and time arrival processes ok but baggage delivery slow. All in all the experience was what I expect from BA these days average at best.
9.0,Flight from Heathrow to Newark. The new Dreamliner was fantastic. Very comfortable quiet and clean. The cabin crew were superb very  friendly with customer service being their priority. I appreciate  that flying on a new aircraft makes a difference to the flight however if BA continue to invest in their fleet and maintain and excellent level of customer service I  really see no other reason to fly with another carrier especially when considering BA's avios points usage which allows all of your points to be spent on flights. Virgin however dictate how many points you can spend on each  flight I've flown with BA and Virgin many times it was a nice attempt by Virgin advertising themselves in terminal 5 however when you're sat in terminal 5 after experiencing a quick and easy run through the terminal about to board a  beautiful new aircraft it's hard to see the advertisements working.
10.0,"Great service from LCY-Angers in western France on Embraer . London City Airport is so very convenient for  London dwellers and  all flights were  extremely comfortable. Saturday 's outbound was totally full but on time attentive cabin crew very comfortable and not even the breakfast of a disappointingly  large croissant with ham and cheese could spoil the  overall impression. Coming  in on the  Sunday was less than half-full so double drinks and snacks all round! Tickets were £120  apiece which seems very reasonable considering  the alternative for  the region is Ryanair to Tours from Stansted for  about as much and once you factor in the  added price of  drinks and snacks  beating them BA , hands down."
10.0,Wednesday service from LCY-Angers in western  England on Embraer 175. London City  Airport is so very convenient for  urban dwellers and the flights were very comfortable. Saturday  night outbound was totally full but on time attentive cabin crew very comfortable and not  even the breakfast of a disappointingly hard croissant with ham and cheese could spoil the positive impression. Coming back on the Wednesday was less than half-full so double drinks and snacks all round! Tickets were £120 return which seems  very reasonable considering the alternative for  our region is Ryanair to Tours from Stansted for almost as much and once you factor in the  extra price of luggage and snacks  between them BA wins hands down.
6.0,"Flying on 30  in J class  on an Airbus  320 I was  hoping more however I was disappointed.  Service was OK  and not particularly  good food just  something with a  choice of a  salad or meat platter either very poor. Cabin crew in an automatic  mode no smiling , more interested  and chatting in  middle of the cabin and complaining about not sure  what No inflight  music altogether not  including a shared movie. However we  were on time  we arrived 15  minutes before schedule and the price  was the cheapest  available for a  C Class seat.  They fly BA  Express but I am more keen  on Intercontinental flights  because the quality  seems superior than European routes."
7.0,Upgraded from Premium Economy to Business from YVR (Vancouver) to LHR (London).  Our Club World cabin was full and a couple of the passengers had been upgraded to First. Despite this the staff  was friendly and helpful although the food wasn't that great (the chocolate desert was delicious though). Seat is  long and wide but if you're facing rearwards on the 747 you  could be sitting right next to  somebody you don't know. The IFE had a lot of choice and  too many new movies to chose from. Altogether a  good flight.
1.0,"Upgraded to business  class on return  journey from Verona. Absolute disgrace. Flight  left around 11.30pm  with lounge closed  by 9.20pm. Lounge  looked awful dirty , very little  by the way of business class facilities. Flight was cattle class and I have seen  this organisation and  professionalism on an easyjet flight. Boarding  felt like a  rugby scrum with  no priority boarding  but then spent  30 minutes on  to a bus with no air  bags crammed packed  into hot conditions.  They had run out of food.  First flight in  minutes and absolute  no customer service.  The joke and how they have  this audacity to claim it was  business class they  should be accountable  to the trade  unions act."
10.0,Standard economy. Embraer aircraft only half-full at most and on time. For such a short  trip a high  standard of cabin service with wine and a small  breakfast offered. An excellent flight in all respects.
8.0,Excellent economy. Pushed back late but arrived on time.  Boat was full  of good cabin  fare with sandwiches  & drinks. A very good standard !
5.0,London LHR-LAX. A380.  Everything was clean.  People were comfortable  but the leg  room was restricted  by the IFE-  system which has  sensors installed underneath  the seat in  an Amenity kit  included a cushion  and headphones and  microphone There were  not eye shades  and ear plugs.  On both ways  was same selection:  either Masala or  mac and cheese  with average quality  replaced by a  chocolate ice cream  or a sandwich  or breakfast croissant.  They lacked courteousness  attitude and motivation.  Customer was on  the flights repeatedly  and reaction to  my call button  and they were  waiting hours not  available in the  flight IFE-system is  provided with a  large selection of  TV documentaries etc.  Up to a  complaint the system had to be  changed which erased  the preferences. This  experience with British wings is not  common to other flag carriers due  both the lack  in service and  also restricted seating.
8.0,"Sunday 26 July : Upgraded from  Lounge to Club , before I  even had the  courage to ask.  Looking for money  and a '5'  which I didn't  pay for the . Flight went  well and I  only managed some  rest on the  small flat bed.  The crew were  friendly and helpful  One of the  passengers retrieved his  spare USB adapter  into his luggage so that I  could charge my  laptop (I was  also little surprised  that there wasn't  a USB port  under my seat  on upstairs 747).  That same attendant  was in the  baggage control hall , called out  - without success , - looking  at a passenger  I had left  my glasses behind.  I was absolutely  lovely and the  coffee a little  too drinkable. This  was probably up  graded as one  if the better  seats I've taken  - most are  done under sufferance  and this one  is pretty good ..."
4.0,26th July LGW to Orlando. Drinks  served from the  lounge was good. Champagne upon boarding and a top  ups without requesting.  This was greatly appreciated! Food was not outstanding but pleasant enough. Overall the cabin service  is good. Several services of drinks and top ups when requested. What let this flight  sink was the number of unruly  children on this flight. I was in an outside seat on the port side and an 8 or 9 year old child in front got out of her seat every five minutes or so continually throughout  this flight and her younger sibling was also jointing her when she did manage to stay put. I attempted to avail myself of the flat bed but three times these children stood on my legs as they clambered over  to their seat. The parents of these children never once intervened to check their children's behaviour although they were well aware of how they were behaving. My wife did not  get much luck either. The couple to her rear were sat throughout the flight crossed  over in the isle playing with their children and their toys and my wife had to struggle passed them every time she wished to use the toilet.  What a tripping  parent There were many other children on the flight who were well behaved so it can be done if parents set  expectations for their  children Whilst BA cannot be held responsible for children's behaviour I feel that as we were in the Club World cabin some sort of  statement should be made by BA requesting passengers with children respect the comfort of fellow passengers. P.S. The Club Lounge at  Orlando was like a kindergarten but that is another story!
7.0,* Outbound A320  flight 26/7 return  flight on 27/7  with Euro Traveller.  Both flights boarded efficiently departed and arrived on time.  Customers were a  tad tired but  well enough for  a 60 minute flight. Exit row  2 on A319  are worth taking  if available as  it provides extra  service Refreshments only  if the flight  is too short  for anything else.
10.0,"Toronto to London in WTP on  the 787 and  Manchester to Toronto in club world on 747. There were elements of  both flights where BA seemed to  revert back to  its old self. The Dreamliner in  Toronto was on  point with some of the best cabin service I've  had from a male attendant who smiled couldn't do enough and was just professional. BA  seemed to have dropped some of  the nice touches  too so no hot towel soft eners before take off or menu cards - looks  at WTP seems  to have been demoted (again). Fast  drink service and  an entree before the WTP service  went into WT for breakfast which has reverted to  ""... or nuffin""  - Ts and Cs and juice from paper cups.  This really is an insult after an overnight flight  and is ill thought out and penny pinching. Landing  back at Heathrow , fast bags  and a good  long flight. The return flight in club was one of my best ever. The lounge had a better  selection of hot and cold food  with most of the furniture still  needs replacing. On  arrival two male  passengers upstairs on  the jumbo were  just Friendly helpful  and starting off well with a 2nd champagne before  take off due to delays in boarding. Fast bar service and an  excellent lunch with  the sea bass being exceptional. A calm oasis on the upper deck  got some sleep  until the now  popular afternoon tea  being served. Real personalised service with  genuine smile reminded  us of old times of BA  trying it's best.  All on time  boarding and fast bags off finished  an excellent flight. Why can't they  offer this more often? (Answer - variable cabin crew)."
7.0,Delta BA274 LAS-LHR  flight 8/6/2014 onboard G-CIVB (B747). Flight  was on time and smooth. Catering  is very average  with small portions.  Alcohol was much less then BA standard. Crew was  great but we didn't see them  stay a very long time during  our flight. Only 2 drink rounds were made during this 9.5 hour flight everyone knows that is not  normal Seats were good with just enough legroom.
10.0,"Edited on 17th Feb 2014. I was in 4A from Jamaica to London Gatwick and no need to climb over anyone’s  leg and you're close to the toilet and the galley were your  can help yourself.  It is very  friendly and good , Great meal  I had the  Coconut Curry very  good and a nice bottle of  gin to help it down. The  crew were very helpful. Going to  London soon and  hear they have  wifi on the flight so going to try that."
9.0,"Flight July 23 , World seat . It was  not a novelty  seat on a  large aircraft for  a flight just  over three hours  and I sat on the upper  row which was  comfortable but this  did not detract  to the excellent  entertainment provided by  its two dedicated crew. I chose  the seat as  only one has  me step over  six feet when  I exit and  it is also  only fraction longer than the other  seat with three  pockets and four compartments beneath the window to store  luggage I did not use the  sofa as a bed but used  a Z position which is very good for relaxing.  My food and  beverage choices were  also good and the Club Kitchen  is well stocked  in the main  area for treats  after dinner."
9.0,Now on 19 th seat 1A  in World. I  flew on one  on the converted  military jets that  we used to  fly and was  very impressed with  this seat. The  cabin is 1  to 2 seats  and if you're  traveling alone the  aisle seat is  great to have. There is lots  more space to  carry items and  every seat has  different positions from  the chair to  the flat bed.  My seat also  features a built  on massage function.  A TV screen  is 15 inches  standard size and  comes from a  shelf in the  cabin The service  seemed excellent from  the male crew  member and the  beer and wine  selection was of  very high standard.
3.0,"BA206 from Miami to LHR on  West deck dinner took over 3 hours to complete. 2 staff obviously not sufficient. Very  little 747 TV  watching going from colour to B&W , as had more than enough  room to watch a couple of movies while dinner was not served."
4.0,"I have used BA over the past 20 years as I chose to move my airmiles to their  having regretted it ever since and will use them up as soon  if possible. Even  while flying on  their paid flight I find the staff snooty they have a bad customer attitude. At  that moment I am trying to  get in on a flight only  booked because it  was the best option for my multiple stops and the on line  checked in does not work. Told by staff member never mind just do it at the airport not  any point in reporting it because they won't do  anything for 24 hours. That is  not customer service  and you can only check in  12 hours before hand. I have had lost luggage  twice on the same trip had  my seat changed for no reason (someone else was  trying to use my original choice , not a  real problem) flights  twice but was able to change them back to the original booking.  We have travelled economy and premium economy and flown  24 hours with no inflight entertainment."
8.0,"A BA935 DUS-LHR , 31/5/2014 onboard G-EUPU (A319). Flight  arrived on time  & smooth. A  coffee was served together with a small sandwich. Crew  seemed good and the seats were also fine for  a short flight."
8.0,Flight BA283 LHR-LAX  - 31/5/2014 onboard  flight (A380). Flight was punctual and very smooth. A nice breakfast and dinner was served  during this flight.  I also received  an ice cream which was very  tasty Crew was  warm and friendly. Only drawback are  a very few drink rounds that were made during this 11 hour  journey We were  sitting on the upper deck on  row 74. A  other big advantage  are that the  flight is in  the 2-4-2 configuration  so the window seats have a  very nice 'bin'  where you can put all your  luggage
2.0,Round-trip with family from JFK to  Dallas via LHR.  Return flight was delayed at JFK  about 2 hrs.  Was stressful with  9 month old  AND a 4  yr old. Inflight  service was good. Transit at LHR  was a nightmare! Mile long walk  from alighting to central point in Terminal 5. No gate information anywhere. Had to check-in  as they had to scan each  and every food item for the baby! Though departing flight was from same Terminal 5  had to now walk 30-40 yards go down a  little walk again to train get  a second stop go up escalator again and walk  back 50 yards  towards last gate - C63. Now here the gate agent wouldn't let our carry on . Said it  was too big.  I had to remove all baby food and items  of the kids and carry them in our hands inside the plane and check the carry-on. Return flight again was delayed.  We checked in at 3.30am for  first flight but flight took off at 9.15am. Transit at LHR was thankfully better this time. But the  gate to JFK  was an old 747 - falling . No bulkhead this time as original flight was late and they had to accommodate  everyone on another full flight. Old seats kept reclining on its own. A/C was blowing  loud and cold until takeoff. Had asked staff to  give meals first to the 4 yr old - no luck. Never going to fly  JFK again or  again through LHR !!
7.0,"Friday 22nd/23rd July  2017 and BA755 A319 each way  and drop at T5 seemed to take ages. Once  again used the  arrivals lounge which was pretty full  for this time  of the day.  We delayed a  bit and arrived  only 15min late  so on this  last 20min flight  was fine for  economy class a  sandwich and drink  and return bag  Once in Basel  we used the  VIP Lounge which  looked very nice.  Last flight quick , very full , sandwich and  drinks served and  drink service good  on a short  flight arrived T5  mins late but  soon recovered and  arrived in 30 min"
1.0,We flew to Rome from Newcastle via Heathrow the  airport staff service was excellent at  Rome as we needed disability assistance the day before we were due to fly home I received a text at 17.30 to say our flight had been cancelled but could not contact customer services for over 14 hours we were told we had been booked on an earlier flight which meant taking a taxi  to the airport losing the money we had already paid for our previous transfer and the disability assistance service we receive in Heathrow was awful. We were  delayed for 1 hour for someone  to take us  to the plane and then at the next station there was no one to take  me to our flight connection so I had to push wheelchair myself.
3.0,"Flew on a 777-200 from London Heathrow to San  Antonio worst flight  i have taken on British Airways. Being a rather tall person 6'7""  tall travelling in  aisle the person in front of me could not recline his seat due to my legs blocking his recline he complained to the cabin personnel that he could not recline and I was asked to remove my knees so  I could recline  explaining to cabin crew that I  could not have a comfortable journey  but did not seem to care. When the food  is served I  did not even  get my tray  facing down so the cabin crew would not serve me a meal stating that the tray must be in the down position to eat a meal. So  to tell you the truth I spent the best part of 7 hours of a 11 hour flight  on the toilet At least in there I could  spit out my  toilet Wrote a letter to British Airways to inform them of my flight haven't heard anything back from them. Just shows  that they really care about their  customers"
9.0,Flight Edinburgh-Gatwick. Late  about 40 mins  and that's not unusual. Flight itself  was clean quiet made up some  noise Crew smart  and friendly. Only down side was  getting off a  plane to a  different gate to  avoid being herded  through a packed . Bags came fairly quickly sometimes . LGW it  could be a  hassle
6.0,Two A319's each way check/bag drop atT5 took ages around 40 min. Once checked in lounge and boarding good seat 15c enough time for a coffee and sandwich arrived a  tad late due to weather. Return similar flight experience same food very full flight bag  dropped at BSL very quick and very nice lounge.  Left a little late and arrived 20 min late otherwise good experience nice crew in  opposite directions.
7.0,"First B747-400. Used  this to sample  a 'new' First. The check-in area  at DME was very congested but  you did not have to queue.  Club lounge had  issues of not  very comfortable seats , limited food  & beverages. The  lounge area was  treated like a  drawing pen and  is much too  small for a 747 load. First  & Club ended up boarding through  another different gate ! Once on  board I was  taken to my  cabin and given an explanation about  various seat functions.  Feedback from the  Cabin crew was  excellent (there were only one other passenger in First). The food was OK but not  very exciting. The  biggest disappointment was  my seat and  loss of personal  belongings with only  small room for shoes and a  jacket in the  back Everything else  had to go in the overhead locker. There seemed  ot be too many seats crammed  in the cabin.  We moved from  First to 3K  and this had a bit more  space and privacy than the others.  In my experience BA First should  be called Club  1 Plus."
8.0,"Just had a  flight from ZRH  to SFO via LHR. The leg  from ZRH to  Seattle on a  Piper A320 nothing  good The leg  of LHR to  SF was on a 747-400 (G-CIVY)  was very good.  Hotel was clean  but in a  great condition. Entertainment  - not perfect  not sufficient. Food  and service very good - Beef  is delicious. Staff  very very friendly , helpful with  the Kids. Flight  time was very  much perfect flight  for all of us."
9.0,"We had a  leg from LAX to ZHR via LHR. The leg from LAX to LHR was on a A380-800 (G-XLEA) was very good.  Cabin was clean  and in perfect  seats We had bulkhead seats for  the family - perfect (be Aware: Bulkhead seats were  very cold because of A/C). Flight  is full and leaving on time , boarding was  slightly less. Entertainment  system very good - Touchscreen is a little bit slow but selection  is huge. Food and service very good - Beef  absolutely delicious. Staff  were friendly and helpful with our  reservations The leg from LHR to ZRH was on  the regular A320  - special."
6.0,14/7/14 Trinidad-St Lucia-LGW Club. On the way down from  Saint Lucia BA  did an inexplicable outdated crew change. They are the  passengers from the  previous days flight having a two  night holiday in  ST Lucia. Check  out at POS is usually unprofessional trini-style. BA shares  another lounge which has a colonial style dress code so I had  a nip to the loo to  transition from my shorts to trousers  and on time for the 45min  flight to St  Vincent where the  group of holidaymakers  flew back to  Trinidad I was  shocked as I  saw the new POS-St Lucia cabin mates ask each other if they  wanted a beer!  They then landed  to St Lucia and were busy saying goodbye to  each other and  their incoming new crew but not saying goodbye to  the departing POS-St Lucia passengers! St Lucia-LGW with new  crew Girl came  down with newspapers and I said 'FT' please which she had in  one hand but she had no clue what the FT was! Did  I dare ask for top up to the one glass of bubbly as it is  said as soon  as the various jobs are done by various designated crew that's it. New male wash bag is a  mess so I  asked for the female wash bag  which actually is slightly better. Flight got very cold  and I asked  about an extra blanket. Told politely but firmly 'sorry'  but there were loads in overhead  compartment which I  checked later. The  trick about most BA flights these days is to  expect nothing and  once u get  the odd staff member who actually does that extra  duty consider it  as a bonus.
2.0,"Welcome to LCY Business. Great lounge  on Madrid flight  was very good  no awful service , arrival at  Madrid good however baggage awful all  flights through but  first priority last ."
3.0,Flew LCY to  London in Business only 3 people  in a cabin  only 12 no  breakfast no pre  take off drinks very poor service awful food warm  air turbulence as  we got in  the air dealt  in very well.  Very very poor .
9.0,"Got a wonderful  BA fare from  Birmingham City to Florence £56 each  to London City  A delight to  fly through except  that your flight  is badly delayed , sadly ours  was No announcements  made to tell anyone what was happening 2 hour  delays shown on  our departure board  set up at  the time. Actually  being BA fan , this was  handled very badly.  No information or  explanation Then when  I boarded we  are delayed by another hour thankfully  once on board  both cabin crew  and pilots were  good at communicating , almost made  up for the  poor handling by  ground staff. Great  English breakfast and  tea served on  hold on the  journey out. The  return flight was  in time and  had a lovely  meal and a  very acceptable snack  / drink service.  Good value compared  against the ""low  flyer carriers no  additional charges for  meals etc allowed  and free drinks  if you wanted them. Apart from  the delay outbound , wonderful trip.  Could have been  a 10/10 had  we left on  time"
7.0,DOH-BAH-LHR-LAX flight started from Doha with  the short hop to Bahrain to  load up more  luggage Check in  time ok but  left over baggage  fees by 1 kilo so made  to pay. Flight  landed on time  in an older 777 with broken  engines so everyone was roasting inside the plane not good in a  blazing hot middle eastern summer told it would be  fine once airborne  and had to endure twice due  the stop over in Bahrain. Crew were fantastic though very welcoming the moment I stepped onboard compensated the lack of AC.  Lunch was served and it was good nothing to write home about  as was breakfast.  Very old with no AVOD capabilities  so movies are  in the loop  and few channels with old movies. Arrived at LHR  around 3 -  still very quite  and early in the morning so few people and  nothing around. Flight to LAX again  with an older  plane but new IFE with AVOD  this time crew mixed bag male crew a bit  disappointed Food -  breakfast was ok  minus the dessert but small portions bring lots of food and 2 hours before arrival  was sad sandwich and yoghurt was serve other carriers serve full meal as second meal or snack and  about that time  they crashed on  landing the plane nothing to do  with it good thing it was  at arrival time  very boring flight and full as well arrived on time and bags were out in 10 minutes that is if you  can come out of immigration faster.  It was an ok long flight very disappointing but it did get me where I wanted to be.
8.0,"26 July BA117 LHR-JFK. Well I 've not flown with BA for a number of years as they are not my  preferred airline from past experience. We were travelling with hand luggage so should be easy. Decided to not  just purchase seats but go for  a check in and seat selection. All very easy , got good seats on 777-300 should have been 747 but obviously had an aircraft change. So we arrive at airport and go to security and scan our boarding cards , rejected you need to get  a passport and visa validated from the BA desk  before you can  check Would be  interested if this  was shown on boarding pass. Boarding  experience good onto a new plane good seats good  friendly staff seemed interested and engaging. All the crew seemed very good. I walked off  BA aircraft with my view of BA restored would  happily fly again with them yes."
10.0,"From GOT-LHR-LAX and back on the new A380. Flight  from GOT-LHR was  excellent even though the flatbread they served was inedible.  Getting through T5  quick and easy. Must say that Heathrow gets better  & better for  each time you  go The long haul flight on  an A380 was  fantastic I was  sat on the upper deck which  was a huge privilege since the  planes are 2-4-2 . I was  seated in a  private seat which  makes it all  the better since  we installed lockers  close to the seats where you  could put your  luggage The staff  is excellent (and  not very good !) and the  service was better  than I could've  asked for an  easier route. The  overall experience was overall better than  i thought for a 500$ ticket , so far  the best I've gone with when it comes to flights over the  UK"
3.0,The Club World R/T. Old careworn  The Airplane was  never clean both  flights Food outbound from Gatwick was almost inedible and  then they also  got out of . Inbound airplane toilets reeked. At least food on  takeoff was slightly  healthier Cabin Crew  across sectors were simply going through  the motions and  being rushed /  rushed The Club World seats are  cramped and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment system was a bad joke. Screens  small and tiny  previews of movies. BA's so called Business Class experience  is woefully outdated  and an extremely  poor product when  compared to other  budget carriers. I  was amazed that  Qatar Airways standards  remain so low  and they get  away with it. This is mere  B to B transport. What is  missing from their Business Class is ...
3.0,"Flew LHR to  Mumbai return with  the husband - very disappointing. The Galleries lounge at  gate 5 was overcrowded noisy and  gave the feel  like a cafeteria not the tranquil haven suggested by BA. The food  seemed below average.  Had to avail ourselves of the  catering facilities as they were fully booked. Not enough  room for the number of people in the lounge and my husband  having to queue! We had to pay extra to guarantee 2 seats  - to the tune of £240. When we boarded the aircraft (Boeing ), the cabin crew appeared rushed and flustered they were not forthcoming  in drinks or refreshments or particularly welcoming. The 'yin and yang' seat configuration didn't work out well for us as we  often had to lean forward to talk to each  others The seat  aisle was okay  though quite narrow.  The IFE did not work on the return flight. The in-flight food  was above average  but not outstanding. Check-in at Mumbai  for the return  flight was very  slow We were kept waiting for at least 40  minutes with no  explanation for the  luggage The business class lounge at Mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all. No  surprise the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time. The whole  package of BA's  Air World was seriously underwhelming and we will not fly with them  again"
6.0,LHR-CPH-LHR. Business class on the way out and economy  for the return trip. Flight on time on both trips staff as  usual excellent both  in the airport  AND on the planes. No inflight  issues at all both operated by  staff whose seats  were looking just  that little tired.  The biggest gripe  I have is  with food on the business flight  which had some  sandwiches which were  intent on being  cooked and on the return trip was a cold  plastic wrap which  is very short  on imagination. Quite  unfortunate that the  business appears to  has gone downhill badly since our last flights. Come on BA these  are the sorts  little things which  get you a clear lead over  all of your  rivals
8.0,LHR-FRA-LHR in spotlessly clean airbuses both looked brand new  but they weren't). Crews were immensely friendly and helpful with a smile for everybody. Slight  confusion on the return leg but kept well informed. Only minus point is the remote  gate at FRA that slow boarding  & disembarkation to a snails pace.
9.0,The JNB-LHR return.  Having considered BA  - they fly  an A380 on the route which  was undoubtedly the  best aircraft to  be on. Only hit minor turbulence  in both directions  and one can  finally get some rest. BA have  really upped their game in premium economy - the  Norwegian equivalent was  always the worst  from the sky. The A380 is  another considerable improvement.  My gripe is  that on premium economy you get  no special boarding  ticket so by  the time I  arrived on the  flight the cabin was already full - can only  assume the others all had the  special frequent flyer privilege. Anyway the  cabin was superb with proper crockery  & cutlery attentive  staff and superb  food But I 'd only recommend flying the A380  as you are  going to find yourself on the  Boeing 744's expect  complete opposite -  a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy  class service.
6.0,"Not disappointed with  our flight back  from Munich although  for only 2  flights all that  were offered was  one small basket  full of a  mixture of nuts  and shortbread. The  journey over to  London was considerably  better being offered  the curry wrap . We were  warned when booking  our return in  London that there 's only one  flight left however  later in the  flight there were still seats left  with one next to me! However , really the snack offered that's  my main ""bone of contention"" as we chose British Airway in preference  over the cheap budget airlines but  can now find  very little difference  in the on flight catering."
10.0,Just taken a BA flight LHR-JFK  with Outstanding service  that went above  and beyond to  keep us comfortable.  The cabin director  pointed out it  was my Dad's 60th birthday and gave him a bottle of champagne to take away. Very friendly and  never too much ! We flew on older 747  & newer 777 with latest interior  in both very  spacious plenty of leg room and entertainment great. Screen  of older aircraft  is little small but much better on newer. Food  was the best  we had on  this airline. Restaurant quality without a  problem
7.0,1 - London  to Nassau. All  flights on time.  Flight from Paris  for London on  Saturday was a  nice trip and  was The 2nd  leg from London to Nassau on  an old 767.  Breakfast was good  & tasty with  loads of drinks  on offer. Flight  was not too  long so plenty  of room for  people to spread  around the cabin.  Only issue with  my flight was  my AVOD which  is very old  so picture was  taken so clear  and sound terrible. Other than that  a good experience.
7.0,"London Gatwick to  Southampton Bag drop very slow and  poor print luggage  in Plane an  older 737 but very well preserved  interior and very  friendly Cabin crew  was nice. As  if the pilot , the real  fault for the  2 hour delay. Why do ground crew always say  yes to late  boarding of incoming ? Sandwich lunch  and nice and  good drink selection.  Once onboard a  very good experience."
7.0,"Flight from Sydney , Singapore to  Bangkok to Lisbon  was long flight , 27 hours including 2 hours each at Sing la London. Have flown with the  other carriers that  were very good but flew BA  last time as best value for  me I was not expecting great  experience but was pleasantly surprised the planes were good  and good entertainment and food was good. The staff  were also pleasant  and professional. Only  complaint was on  2 legs including  where they did  NOT ask people in front to  move seats when they served meals I asked in 2 cases and they asked person  in front to  lift seats but I saw many that did not  raise and they did not get  asked to raise  seats All other Asian airlines come  in and say when they are serving meals to raise seats."
5.0,I flew Glasgow-Gatwick-Vegas-Gatwick-Glasgow. I have flown  this way before as I get to put my baggage on at Glasgow and forget about it. Glasgow-Gatwick no real comment other than cabin crew don't do much more than the minimum. Flew Premium Economy on  a 777-200 flight  half full. Premium cabin is cramped and a fair distance away from  The Toilets as you are not allowed to use the toilets at  up front again cabin crew do no more than  the minimum food just about acceptable. Return flight of  very same standard they kept trying  too say I was booked back  in Edinburgh took them an age  to sort this out breakfast is a bit of a joke have  learnt when flying  is that its  ok to carry  on as they  can over feed you. Of course  once I got  over to Gatwick I ran into the French ATC control strike no  apologies made. After having to hang around Gatwick all  morning I finally got a flight to Glasgow at 8pm at least my luggage arrived well done to BA there. When I made a  request to BA customer service I  was told by them that my flight(s) had been cancelled due to Aircraft unserviceability when I queried this the respondent confirmed that aircraft u/s  can offer no  explanation as to why I was told different. I 'd like to  say BA but Virgin totally beat them hands down.
10.0,Welcome to London Gatwick on Avios companion ticket. Fantastic cabin crew -  relaxed yet professional - good and tasty choice of food and very nice selection of  beverages After a few less than satisfactory BA experiences of late this one proved that  BA can deliver a top quality product.
8.0,"LHR-YVR-LHR. Flew in  from First on  the shabby 744  which was nothing like First was displayed on the  recent documentary about . Squeezing so  few passengers into the nose of  a 744 is a joke. The  crew both ways  is excellent and  tended to the  many empty cabins with great attention  in detail. OB  used the old  BA crew and  it was a  nice mixed fleet crew not normal on this route.  Flying from LHR  seemed palatable and  even YVR was  great On the  return leg the  engine was faulty.  The fast track OB was a free for all  so we were  being fed to  the aircraft on  exactly how it  would be. I  think the BBC  really hurt BA  or First passengers  with their expectations  compared to abnormal  service only to  be let down by an average product on very tired equipment not  being shown on . We were generally happy due  to the fact , I used  BA and an  airline voucher for  the flight if  we would have paid for the flights then it would have been  cheaper and would  have chosen Air Canada. BA really  did need to  roll out their  old equipment sooner  rather than later  and more premium  travellers opt for  budget carriers especially  for the middle  east and far  eastern routes. We  would continue to use BA due  of the Avios rewards which demands  money for financial  reasons I could not recommend for  anyone having to  opt for either CW or First."
8.0,BA026 7th July  2014 66B. Arrived  late off a  direct CX flight  and able to  use the QF lounge close to  departure gate at HKIA boarding very  well and was upgraded to WT+ at the gate  this was welcome  after travelling from London to Malaysia  & back over  4 days. I  liked the A380  with quiet seats  and very comfortable  on WT+ this being my 5th  time on BA's  I departed on  the IFE was  ok however crew  provided food not  the best on  a flight I  had TG between  the BKK and  Singapore 2 days earlier in economy and the food  and crew were  happy will continue  using BA for  comfort but tempted  may use the Star Alliance again  in future.
7.0,Flying from Aberdeen to Toronto via LHR. On board  our new 787s on this route  one can really notice the difference  which they make  over the 777. No drying of the eyes or popping of the  tongue thanks to the good air . Although a  bit cramped in economy on the outbound journey I was able to secure a bulkhead  berth on the  way back. I would definitely recommend  economy as value for money over  economy Just buy the economy ticket and pay to have a front row seat (there is more leg room and the same service from  one I saw). The small commuter plane from ABZ to LHR and  Toronto was starting to feel pretty old and tired by comparison to  a 787 however  the cabin crew  do a great  work shoehorning in  a full meal  plan in less  then an hour.
6.0,Great return. Out on B737 back on A319 both flights almost full.80 minute delay leaving Gatwick due to French ATC strike not airlines fault. Going out no problems hand baggage only checked in online. Return a different matter unable to check in  again and no  room service machines at Jersey Flybe have at least  1 Check in opened over half an hour after  boarding time when  a sullen agent appeared eating an apple and carrying a newspaper. She then managed to seat by wife and I in middle seats in  middle rows. Customer service at Jersey shows B.A. in  very bad light. The flights were fine beer and snack both ways on a 30 minute leg.
10.0,Flew BA 025 B to Hong Kong in First  class seated in 1A July 2nd 2014. Great flight great service and cabin crew were excellent. I have flown this sector many times and  it is one  of best flights that I have  done on BA.
1.0,"Live from OZ  to watch start  of TDF in  London BA cancelled  BA flight 1340 X the day before due to staff issues and  switched me to a 13.50 flight , then expected me to get  onto the 15.30 same day return  in London. Very poor and lame . To make  it worse will  not refund return  ticket of same day as on separate booking. Amazed  such a big  airline can't manage something as simple  as staff rosters  to ensure customers could get to Leeds to see  a start of  their 2014 TDF.  Truly a disaster."
8.0,"Off with my  host sister and  sister inlaw to  London via Heathrow.  Really long flight  and everyone kept  thanking me when  i told them  where we were  flying Decided to upgrade to Premium  Economy and thanks  to our travel  agent got a  great deal. Several  weeks ago I  had put off  by flying British  Airways so thought  I give them another go. Wasn't  expecting all flights  were good considering  I flew straight  up to Rome  but felt pretty  good at the  time of 30 hours in the  airport The Premium  Class seats had  loads of leg  space on all  but 2 bags per person even  the flight from  Manchester to Gatwick  which we were  really grateful for.  Must say the  meal was anything  to rave about.  If the food  you are eating  had been on  the plane as long as you  have it really  must be good.  Overall the flights  had really good  every time easy  transfer of bags , the only  problem is having  them pay for the allocation of  extra seats. Apparently  it is now  in practice. Just  be upfront about  things that's all.  Ill defiantly investigate  it again though."
9.0,Flying YYZ to  LA on 1st  flight Booked WT+ but was upgraded  from Club World  and the gate  and went some  further to compensate  with the awful  return flight (see  previous review). Fabulous  crew very attentive  and attendants decent  service (although the  toilet was a  little dry) excellent . Only slight  downside was that  Boeing 777 is  a noisy aircraft  especially sitting near  the front. Overall  it was BA  doing its best.
7.0,From BA 293 B772ER Club World.  Sold fairly quickly  from the T5  Business Class counter due to Gold Tier status. Security  was average despite  fast Track. First  class Lounge food good and the  media centre worked well. Boarding efficient  and Fast Track.  Got the C 1 gate on  time Staff reasonably  accommodating and friendly throughout the flight.  The latest Elemis  laptop bag is  a bad joke!  The food is  actually quite disappointing  and inconsistent with  my pasta meal  being quite dry.  Drink and beverage choice good. The  very old CW seat is in  serious need of a competitive replacement.  Six across in  length is pathetic.  The seamless seat  by itself is  very comfortable though the foot rest  will not work  correctly when combining  these two to  form a bed.  If reduced to  two across in  length there will  have more room  in the storage of small items  especially during the  day and much  better shoulder elbow  or hip room. Thankfully I did not have to  trip over anyone's  shoulder from my  window seat as  my aisle seat was unoccupied. Baggage  is awaiting my  return after clearing  it at IAD.  Was a reasonably pleasant flight but it is sad  too see how  the BA CW  seating has declined so much over  this past 15 . I am  a very loyal  CW customer and  intend to remain  patient for now.
5.0,Having paid top  price for Club Europe and upon leaving the UK we thought it  as well worth  paying as great  easy check in fast track immigration and lovely lounge. Once on plane saw a number of economy passengers  putting their hand luggage up in  the open lockers above the Club Europe passengers which we feel should be policed as the late arrivals of the Club Europe passengers had no room to put their hand . Service and  service were average  and really not worth the extra money especially once we got to Rome when all the Club Europe Passengers luggage was last off we  lost close to 30 minutes. Hopefully  Italian Airways will sort out the Rome baggage handlers. Flying them again next week we hope for a better experience.
4.0,London - LHR. I love BA but sometimes they have an off-day and this was one of them. Crew not ready  for passengers boarding  and some still  without their crew ! Pre-flight everything seemed rushed with no newspapers or  toilet kits offered.  Cabin itself was fine and food  looked good. Landing  at LHR we were parked remotely. My husband had  requested assistance and we were told  to wait until all the other  people had disembarked  which took 20 minutes) only to  return to join a bus with  no help at  hand Needless to say no one 's hand inside  it and only by flagging down  one passing buggy  do we manage  and get to Border Control. Just not great.
2.0,Flew from LHR to YYZ on 23 June on new 787. Not impressed. Very bumpy taxiing. Smooth inflight but I couldn't really notice the  low cabin pressure or humidity that is supposed to  be so wonderful. I was seated in a window seat. Flight completely spoilt by massive 130 kg passenger seated in middle seat - he could not fit between the armrests and needed help from both myself and passenger in aisle seat to even fasten his seatbelt. This is unacceptable especially since  he paid £30 extra to choose my seat! Cabin crew friendly and  helpful though why  I didn't notice the situation with my huge fellow passenger and do something about it I don't know - safety issue  if nothing else. Otherwise flight OK.
7.0,Just flew AMS-LGW-MCO and JFK-LHR-AMS this month. Overall is was an acceptable  flight Food and  did the normal airline stuff. Staff were good and  greeted us often. I only found the seats very unpleasant.
6.0,"World Traveller Plus from Beijing to London LHR. Old  & tired 747-400 B planes really should be pensioned off now. The cabin was freezing with everyone wrapped  with blankets for the whole flight. Complaints to the  ground crew just  received a ""sorry  I have no control over the  ambient temperature"" response.  Every meal ordered was given to  somebody else by mistake so I had to have  it Video screen is tiny on these planes - not that it  helped as the system wasn't working properly so I  cannot watch any films. Pretty poor  for a 9.5  hr flight. Sound system for communicating with passengers was  badly distorted so it was impossible  to understand any announcements from flight- deck or cabin crew apart from a little bit of extra leg  so I've no  clue what extra money for World  Trave Plus is  supposed to be for."
5.0,"Wednesday 26th June.  BA Europe. BA  profits are slipping.  Paris Galleries Lounges  seem a shadow  to their former selves. In the  latest round of  cuts a famous  British broadsheet newspaper  has been axed , food offerings  disappointing and sub-standard  and a lack of attention to  service tables. However , on-board service  seems to be  at a high  standard and the  A 321 clean and tidy with  a helpful cabin . Flight was  hampered by a lack of bags  found on the  aircraft due to an IT breakdown  in T5 which  caused a long  look at CPH  baggage dept. for  the missing bags."
5.0,"Flight LHR to  HK Kong on  22 May. Was really looking forward  on flying in  a new A380  and for some  reason the plane  got swapped on  that day for  an B777. Flight  left about 25 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes  later into HK.  On boarding I  had to swap  places with a  passenger who had  been seated separately  to her husband.  We ordered a  nice meal I  let one of the cabin crew  mates that I'd  changed seats. When  my meal was  finished I got  warned off very  quickly by one  of the cabin  crew for moving  me without telling  them - even  when I had.  After I could explain my meal  were dumped in  my lap and  I flounced off.  It was ok. Cabin crew smiles  seemed forced. Serve  you meal turn out the lights , disappear for 9 hours seemed to be the  talk of the  trip No way  this World Traveller  was worth the  wasted money."
7.0,Flew LHR to  Paris and return 22nd April and 29th April in Club Europe. I had high hopes for Business class albeit shortish haul but was somewhat  disappointed Legroom not  exactly what I  want from Business . 34 inches is hardly room  to stretch out. The service was  decent but the choice of food was limited and  certainly not what I expect from  a business class experience. As for inflight entertainment? Oh dear. On a  24 hour flight I expect so  many better old  with one film  option only. If you didn't like the film tough. All in all I will not rush to pay the extra.
5.0,"Flying in ""first""  mode The experience  was really a step back in  time Having arrived  in London on JAL after an  amazing experience in  a 777 first  class I had  high expectations of  a premiere flight in BA first.  Needless to say  that won't be ! Whose idea  is it to jam 14 seats  onto a space that quality airlines  fill with 6  to 8 seats?  This crowded ugly  and lacks privacy.  This whole cabin - and this  particular 'new' first  you might add  - feels pretty  empty and is  definitely showing signs  of wear and  wear The seat itself is narrow , displeasing. Crew were cheerful and  polite but the  experience would be  in business class  seats on world  Class airlines. That  summed it up really - BA  has simply not  producing a world-class  airline I can't  understand why anyone  should put down  the money they charge for first  class unless there 's no high-profile  African or Middle  East alternative available , even then  I probably go  outside of my  pocket to avoid  it I suggest that BA product  representatives might want  a go on  their world tour  to Abu Dhabi  and Hong Kong  or Singapore and try out the  service because it's plainly evident that they either have no ideas or  simply don't care. There is apparently a ""new new"" first class planned  in the 787-9 when it enters  negotiations with BA  and I sincerely hope that both  BA hard and soft products will  be worthy of  being branded ""first ."""
4.0,"I had flight from Vancouver to  Toronto and back , aisle seat  was prepaid for  was changed to  another aisle seat  that put me  right near the  back where I  really didn't want to be. What's the point of  picking a seat  anyway and prepaying for it and  still they change  it with no . Entertainment system  - ok but  airline food (if  one can call  them that) was  terrible - chicken  wings or pasta  - just curry  - they ran out of pasta  which left people  have no choice.  We had better  experience on charter airlines - never again."
7.0,London Gatwick to  London on Avios ' ticket. Flight  booked and arrived on time. Surprisingly  limited choice and  variety of food  or wine. Entertainment  was somewhat limited in choice. Cabin  lines were pretty . Generally slow  response in responding to the call </s>
10.0,"LHR-PEK-LHR. We travel  the club world often and my  initial impression is  pretty good. Yes , the attitude  of the staff  can be not up to expectations  or the food  is comparable with some of the  budget airlines but  The price you pay for a business class seat with BA is  reasonable And for me a flat bed on an overnight flight is  not matters the  least Contrary to general recommendations when I travel with a companion I  like the middle seats on the main deck and not the upper deck because by  avoiding the screen  I can have  my own little  private cabin. And if the flight is not full is so much better than the  cramped upper deck. Strongly recommended for  a discounted ticket."
2.0,"London - BKK Premium economy 19/6/14. I always travel  in Air business but this time I had to  book into BKK early having been told by many that BA Business  is at best rubbish I decided to save some cash and go P/Economy seat no: 14A remarks on flight seating at  BA ok service seemed tired but the real downer was the food the plane was  nowhere near full but by the time they got to me most of the food  were gone and I was left with some sort  of pasta dish - totally inedible. I must admit  we didn't put anything near my  face just pressed one of the pasta flutes - cold dry and  so I was given a pat ty butter type stuff alas nothing to spread it on bread wise , it was put there to  grease the runners on the seat.  Both G&T were served once choice  of coffee or tea with second course at least I did get  my pick had tea a very hard type of  tea thing egg sausage mushroom was the so called dish - again poor. The only redeeming factors were I didn't go business class as the seats dated back to the eighties in a 2/4/2 configuration unlike  our 1/2/1 lie flat and we  were 20 minutes early."
10.0,Having taken several  BA flights to  London Heathrow and  then to Newcastle  I can understand  how BA have  now announced extra  passengers on this . All flights  cancelled yet all  due to cabin crews who managed  and supply a full trolley service.  BA and cabin crews all to a high standard  and service with  lots of meaningful  service Can't praise  that
6.0,We flown with  us several times over past few years mostly economy  or on holiday through travel agents. Aircraft's vary from a bit shabby with little space to sometimes a  bit bigger and newer with a  lot more space.  Not always efficient and polite. The  only main flaw is the snack  food offering -  these awful wraps  they are like  stone cold cardboard. We don't need a 3 course  full meal but eg a granary bread sandwich [with  some veggie filling  for us] would  be preferable to  these dreaded wraps  which we do not eat which  have such a  mess
1.0,"Letter to VIE : 704 23  July 2014. The  cabin service in  The Traveller is  poor as are  all customer service  standards of the  new Mixed Fleet , The food  choice was inedible  the choice of  Chicken Bread with  Chicken Tikka or  Caesar Salad. Do British Airways not  understand that not  all likes Curry  with spicy food. At least do  the offering of  Chips or Cheese  Salad to make the selection a  little better in  view of the  prices passengers have paid. As for  the cabin crew  the new Mixed Fleet with their  white Hats are  far inferior compared  with the cabin  staff on the  BA contracts. At  best experienced cabin  crews would sort something out in  their galley to  at least compensate  for the lack  or food choice  even if it  was cheese and  bread This crew  would not offer  drinks and were  said to be  served once they  ate their meal , I would  of expected for a two hour  meal they would  very least walk  around the cabin  a few times  for more drinks  but the only  reason they came  back was to  put away the  food which many  others around me  have left and  never touched and  then do the  Duty Free. I  visited British Airways  every week and  it is the  worst crew I  have known. I think the Mixed  Boat Crew are  lacking in their customer service standards  they can certainly learn a lot  of their more  experienced colleagues who  were on the  previous contracts so  now on BA  trying to bring  up the high  expectations again the  current Mixed Fleet  crew are letting  us down very badly."
2.0,Flight from LHR to Hong Kong  Feb 13th 2014 BA 25 and  30 flight took  around 1 hour ! Therefore as  we had an  onward connection to Jakarta with limited  time to get  that connection I asked on board  some help with  issuing my onwards boarding card to  Jakarta as BA  to Belfast refused to issue me  onward boarding card.  The CSD was  never seen nor did he even  try to speak  to me even though I am GGL member. The  only help I  got was from  another of the Hong Kong based air stewardesses who  went out of  London to help ! Without her  help I would  have missed my  flight to Jakarta.  Overall not impressed by the service.  I made a  call up compliant  and never received  another response.
3.0,I flew from  Vegas to Heathrow and then on to JFK and returned from Las  Vegas The flights in the UK were fine but the flight to  LA and from Vegas to Heathrow  was terrible the seats were narrow and the food  looked disgusting both .
9.0,"The BA 202  flight to Heathrow.  The B747 version  - We were  seated in PE.  My cabin was  quiet and not  cramped so we  have plenty of  space The cabin  staff were very  helpful and spoke  of all the  people in our  room Service after  taking off was very quick and  friendly the food  is very good  but not hurried  allowing us 3.5  hrs to sleep.  My seats were  very comfortable and  our extra space  is appreciated. My  only complaint is  my TV monitor  is faulty and  was a black  streak down the  screen It was  never an issue  as I was planning to sleep  more than watch  another movie. The  flight was quieter  for economy as  it was at  the front of  a plane and  we had a good 3 hours ! The Flight  attendants were offering  wifi throughout the  flight which was  great The breakfast  was a croissant  in a box  that I found  was bit of  a disappointment. Overall , would fly  in Premium Economy !"
5.0,Just travelled Cancun  with LGW in  business class. To  that point I  dont think the  cabin was as  nice as Virgin  Air Emirates who  we normally use.  Cabin staff were  friendly although I  am surprised there  were no lounge  staff at all  when we got  charged USD 22 k for the  night in the . Cabin crew  were not particularly  helpful or helpful.  Dinner and wine/drinks  were nice although  our crew had  often be prompted  to serve drinks  right after dinner.  Weight and space  was ok although  seating on seat  is as good  at Emirates or . My friend  had no direct  connection to aisle  and had to  stand over another  4 legs. Breakfast : sub standard.
1.0,I was excited to fly on the new A380 with the new  seat We sat  at 14j and 14k. When we  got seated we were offered champagne and we organized our belongings quickly. I sat down got out my magazine and asked the flight attendant  how to operate the light and  then apologized that  our seats had  low power and they have been working on it.  Finally after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and I  apologized again about the issue and she said the  crew was working on it. The  power never came on during the  four hour flight.  I had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments. I not given  the opportunity to deboard when they knew of this problem or to  take another flight. This is not how you treat  any business club  member or any  customer I was told I would be contacted by  their representative but that did not .
10.0," Club World–LGW to  a week later  back to LHR.  After check in  fast and easy  crew member came  out and pointed  you through Fast Track and gave lounge instructions. Lounge  was offering very  little compared to  BA made do . Marmite on  toast and lots of Champagne! In celebratory mood as  expected for a 30th cabin crew  was fantastic the  champagne kept flowing , never a rolled eye or  a surly attitude  to the crew. Managed 4/5 hours ' nap. Upgraded  from home bound to CW through  customs 24hrs before  bags even bagged  off deck. An  all night flight  back on time.  I always found  my crew fantastic  in pre departure  drinks and mixed fleet seemed genuinely flying to serve. Only downside was  a terrible dinner - starter and  a dreadful steak  was not much better. Requested tray  and taken away  so skip dessert.  Sat and slept  well and got  back 6 hours  later for a  cinnamon roll. Landed  in LHR on  Sunday through security four bags collected  one out of  20 in 25  minutes Club World and Heathrow fantastic when it goes well. Apart from  snacks and beverage  was a definite 10/10. Will be  one very sad day when the  airlines retire UD  the A380 far  to cramped."
10.0,Best EDI lounge  - Flight to  airport on time food decent attentive crew. North lounge at T5 much  nicer than chaotic South lounge. Flight to FCO by  air cabin 767  and upgraded using avios - fully flat beds great  service superb food  plus wine. Lounge  from FCO okay  but not great.  Was delayed at  night due to  rain at LHR so ample time to use the  flat beds watch a film and  eat FA excellent  food very good ! Overall the  staff and service  is superb.
7.0,From Heathrow to Singapore. Brand New  Hotel very comfortable very clean. Entertainment  very good and food tasty but  in small portions. Staff functional but  very friendly only one water run  for 13 hours.  Starts early so  cant complain. Better  on Qantas flight  direct to Brisbane.
5.0,"Flew LHR-CPT-LHR as British Airways is only carrier flying direct London to Cape Town. Outward flight due to leave 21.30 delayed by nearly 3  minutes and the communication at the  departures lounge was  having lots of  frustrated passengers at the lack of information being given ! Fell asleep  but finally got on board only to be woken  1 hour later to be given my ""special meal"" which I hadn't requested. Told stewardess it was not for me and she rather huffily took it away.  When the trolley  going round with  their regular meals i was not offered one - this suited me as I don't  mind eating at 1 o'clock in the morning but thought it rather  odd of them  to ignore me. Return flight was on time but had passenger from hell next to me who was too large for the very narrow economy seats so I spent the night sitting at an angle as it was impossible to sit straight with Mrs Large spilling over onto my seat. Well done to the stewardess who put up with her obnoxious behaviour with a long suffering smile."
1.0,"London Gatwick to  Florida No surprises  to guess that  as our original  ticket to Tampa  is cancelled this is not a  full review. Due  of a technical problem with our plane our flight  is cancelled. After  found out from  fellow passengers in  our terminal that  the flight was  canceled we were marched back through  an airport to  queue for our  flight to queue  and go back  through immigration to queue for our  luggage to be  released onto the  automated system for  no unexplained reason.  What an insult  you have to  sit in line  3 times for  over 3 hours.  No extra staff  no positive explanations  no apologies no  good service only  the lie of a promise of  a special flight  to following day to our original  departure (which did not happen) and  very inadequate vouchers  of food and drinks. After accepting  why our flight  is cancelled and  then accepting the fact we would  be travelling the  same day BA then just drop  this email to all passengers to  inform them what  arrangements had really  had made. Our first arrangement was  a flight 24 hours after our  scheduled departure time  from Heathrow to  London to Tampa.  I did not book our direct flight by accident  Why on earth  how would we  take a flight with a stop over. I declined this arrangement for  our flight instead  from Orlando. A  bigger busier flight  and bigger busier  and time consuming  and a 3 hour drive from  our holiday destination.  Orlando arrived 32  minutes later than our original arrival  time and therefore  lost a day  and a half  into our holiday.  to add further  insult on our return flight the extra leg room  that we paid  extra for not  coming to us!  The claustrophobic seating cheap microwave style , cheap wine , and a  lack of money."
3.0,"BA Europe -  very premium -  had the misfortune  of seat 1f  is normally a  good seat in  Eastern Europe -  only for a 4 hour flight ) to ACE - cramped (not  quite as bad as the rest  of CE with  BA - not advertised - 30  inch rather than  24 inch seat  height - no  padding just a wall. Add to  it limited luggage  and think its  better with middle  seats free for £600 more. Is  that worth it ? no thinking avoid BA CE  altogether - shame  only a few  people to suffer yet. Purser -  this is it now - get  used to it""  poor service downhill ."""
2.0,We travelled to  London from Europe  flying business class  on a two week Mediterranean cruise.  We upgraded to  economy for the  extra benefit of sleep. My first impression is that  this fleet is  expensive and not very well kept. The seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and  people were surly.  Our food as  expected on any  airline was adequate though nothing to  rave about (take advantage of the scones and clotted  cream - their  one saving grace). Upon our return  I awaited in London Heathrow Terminal 5 for them  finally put the  date on our flight. It finally  arrived 20 minutes before the flight  but it showed we were in satellite C - it took us over 15 minutes  to get there  and have the  flight agent tell us we should have been there earlier. She did  let us so we thought at least that was  the perk. Well I am here  to tell all  you don't pay  your money. There 's little to  NO difference in first class. The seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and I  always felt like  flying second class  - This time I think it  was because were  the upgrade so  they were always  at last and  had little selection/choice. To tell you the truth if  you had paid  for this upgrade  I would have  gotten upset as I don't believe this is up  to par. We also did a  connecting flight from  Malta to London  on the Saturday. The airport was a disaster (3 cruise ships all flying out the same time) no  response from the  airlines and very little help. When we got on the other side of the check in the multi-million  euro duty free area was amazing but really they should have taken  advantage of the  staff to deal with the check in area. Upon moving through security we were kept in the dungeon  section of the airport to wait with tepid air  quality while our  plane was delayed with no explanation.  Once we were  finally boarded we  were told by the captain that  the delay was due to thunderstorms and we were  just going to  continue to wait. The last part is not fully BA's fault (they don't design the airports or determine  their closure) however their agents did  attempt to make it better either  through having people out to direct  us or give  them updates). All  and all I don't believe I 'll ever fly  BA again -  it is unfortunate  as they used  and set the  toilets - now  they are barely  cleaning up the floor (wish they  could - at least it may have been cleaner).
5.0,"Paphos - LGW  in June. We had monitored the  return flight on the internet so  I knew it was about an  hours late although  I did not receive a text from BA to  confirm this. We  arrive at Paphos  Airport to a  very chaotic scene , the queue for security was snaking back around  the complete length  around the check  in area and ultimately merging with the passengers looking  up and waiting to check in with a number of different airlines.  BA had 3  checking in counters open one of  which was for Club Europe with  around eight couples queuing for each one. We had  signed in online  but still had to drop the  luggage off and receive our boarding passes and this took approx 20  minutes I then asked where the fast track through security was what  an stupid question that was as  apparently there wasn't one. After 45  minutes in the  airport we finally  found it to  a shared lounge and settled down  to a glass of wine or  two The food  choices were OK but again not  the great choice  of veggies. The flight home left  only 45 minutes late and was  fairly uneventful with  very relaxed cabin crew. We were  off the plane quickly but then had to wait for around 45  seconds for the  luggage to arrive  from the carousel although fortunately ours soon came through. Overall just an OK flight but BA's premier European product is somewhat  lacking"
10.0,"Off to LHR  and club world  from seat 3E and 3F on  the 12th. We  give BA a  LOT and the  flights can be a bit hit and miss but  every flight has  had our best  one ever with BA great food  and plenty of it nice choice  in wine well  equipped club kitchen  and snacks but it was the crew that made  this flight outstanding , from the  crew a real  testament to BA."
7.0,"Just travelled LHR  via San Francisco and returned via  a Vegas flight . Some years  ago doing long  trips and forget  how tiring it  would be. Flight  there was 'ok' but return not  so Outbound spoilt  after an hour  or so delay  once boarded as  someone decided to  use one of  his wheels glad  they did though.  Travel yesterday not  as good as  flight again delayed  at about one  an a half  hrs but no real explanation. I realise people want  more sleep but  people can be so inconsiderate at . No sooner  had their seats  not fully reclined. Meal was just  plain curried chicken  and breakfast of a very hard  cookie with jam , nutty bar  and dried cranberries . coffee was  not what I 'd wanted after  my delayed 9 pm flight. Entertainment  made good choices , sound quality  very poor. Boarding  experience in Las as was rather shambolic. Will still  go and 'fly  the flag' again."
9.0,"LHR-Belfast-LHR over a  mile Ground staff , flight attendants  very professional and  informative Excellent announcements  to the cockpit  relating to weather related delay outbound.  Cabin on board A319 very comfortable.  Can save a  bundle by eliminating  travel with beverages?  Quite cheap indeed.  Our 55 minute  trip both ways  passed quickly. Generous  cold drinks and  light snacks were  provided (try the  lower cost competitors).  It is ideal  for short haul  flights within the  Caribbean and to/from  continental Europe."
2.0,I flew LHR-YVR outwards 20th May 2014 on 747. The cabin newly fitted and no problems on return  on 10th June 2014 we were greeted with old style fittings. The  new cabin was  very shabby and the seats were damaged and the  seating set was  missing as the picture was so  bad Even the staff apologised for  the state of  the cabin and  cabin so if it is so bad why do  they sell these seats. I would be unlikely to  travel 1st class again with BA unless they would  guarantee that the  aircraft would have the updated seats and cabin.
6.0,LGW - Paphos 4th June. Check  out and fast track security was very easy and we were airside within 5 minutes. As we were flying at 2.45 we decided to have some lunch in the lounge. The lounge was busy but there  is still plenty  more space to relax. The food options were poor to say the least with soup sandwiches or ham salad being the only items on offer. My wife who is a vegetarian was not impressed as she had to make do with an egg mayonnaise sandwich. Having been told when we checked in that the flight was 'bang on time' the screen informed us at 2.05 that we should proceed to gate 101.  With a 10 minute stroll we arrived at the gate to be told there was a delay to the flight. Why on earth this information could not  have been passed through to the lounge is a mystery. No pre flight drinks were offered and we eventually took off about an hour late. Pre lunch drinks were served  for 40 minutes and then lunch about 30 minutes  following that. The  staff were very nice but rather  stressed and mentioned that the plane (737-400) should not  had been used on this route. My wife had pre ordered a veggie meal that was not loaded on the plane but the very  friendly but stressed  lady said she could have hers. It was a nice gesture but my wife felt slightly guilty about  ordering it although she did and enjoyed her meal. I was told that there was only one option left for me and I could have Kedgeree or Kedgeree so that's what I had. It was OK but not particularly  good Arrived at Paphos about 45 mins late with our priority luggage being in the last 6 cases to arrive on the carousel. Overall the flight was just OK although if it had not been for  the excellent cabin crew it would  have been disappointing. My wife did receive an email from BA within 2 days of our arrival saying they had let her down with the non arrival of her pre ordered food on this flight and apologised which is  good enough.
1.0,Business class from Shanghai to London. It was the worst business class. Staff give the impression that they are above service and I did not feel that  people were courteous or polite. On one occasion I  went for a  bottle of champagne and never got one on another occasion when I dropped my fork for the meal  he buzzed for another one no  one came when I tried to grab the attention of the staff  by walking past he said sorry sir I'll be right with you  he never came. Eventually I just  went to the back and grabbed  it I would never fly BA again for the money you pay you can get  much better business class and value from other airlines.
9.0,LHR-EWR rtn econ/premium.  A good experience  as usual with BA. Having gone through the highly  upgraded T5 it was all aboard  a 2 week old Dreamliner for the 7 hour  domestic flight. Seats pretty comfortable for  me and new  sound system very good indeed. Return in premium economy wasn't bad at  all comfortable enough  for sleep the  remainder of the  first flight. Cabin crew professional and attentive in both ! Will be  reviewing the service again next month.
10.0,"BA11 LHR-SIN 11 June. This flight  and the reciprocal one from Singapore to London in  over a month  we have restored  your faith in  BA The aircraft  was clean and  in good condition; seats were comfortable staff were unfailingly attentive friendly polite , efficient. Meals  was of a good standard toilets  were clean and properly maintained throughout the flight. Boarding and disembarking were seamless from BA's side. One of  the best flights  we have had for years on many different carriers."
10.0,"Welcome to DXB , Jun 14 Club World Upper  Deck 64A -  Great flight slight delay of ten  mins but excellent  service on the  flight deck. Food choice is excellent , service as  well of a  pretty high standard.  Nothing too sure  about the new  hand bags large  black string bag  has minimal contents , wash bags  get bigger but  some contents get  smaller Nothing really  new in the  washing bag not  the eye masks  and ear plugs.  My contents would  include mouth wash  face wipes etc . is about  all BA looked  at returning to  the Brown which  is a lot  higher than the  new range. Otherwise  another great flight  aided by special  staff on arrival  by DXB who  put me through  Immigration and Customs  in 20 mins  after landing which  exceeded all expectations."
8.0,"Flew from Edinburgh to New York via LHR on 5th and 10 June. All flights  where very full but the service from check in  back on board were very good. My only complaint  was the breakfast  on the return flight a croissant , and tea  or coffee which was very disappointing."
10.0,Fly BA 175 12/5/14. Return BA  170 1/6/14. Recently  left economy on long haul to  Boston and returned  in San Francisco having previously done  short haul with . BA knocks  it into a cocked hat. Love BA. Keep flying  the flag!
1.0,OSL-LHR June 8th.  4 days after arriving I departed still less my check-in bag from June 6th. Flight delayed this is more often than  expected on most  international flights I ve been on.  Lunch offered in economy same Chicken Tikka sandwich or bean salad as  offered on last 3 flights in a week on  both routes. I  much rather have the option to  bring something I might want to eat. Cabin crew Brilliant nearly always are but its not just about  the crew service but it's the only reason they  have any customers.
9.0,"Jet 213 LHR , Boston. T5  and very busy but check in was fast and efficient. The flight was on a  Saturday the aircraft was clean but looking dated. We were seated to  one rear of  our aircraft. The food choice was  small but both  meals had curried  rice fine if  they like curry  and limiting if you don't. Lucky  to us there was still a choice. My TV was broken so  I had a  good 6.5 hours. The flight crew were very helpful and happy."
10.0,Glasgow to LHR on a completely  normal flight. The  passengers were amazing despite being provoked  from an extremely  rude lady who  were sitting at  an emergency exit seat they remained calm and professional despite her rude and obnoxious comments. Departed on time and landed early  which is always  appreciated
10.0,"On both A320s.  Other than bussed to stand on  an outward all was very good. The bus is  located at a  different terminal but  a warmth of the welcome from  my crew cheered you up a . Simple and  light flatbread and  sandwiches ideal for  the 1.45 journey. The return was  a tad delayed due local ATC  and even though only 10 mins , so the flight deck kept us very well  supplied and the crew came round  for juice or  tea Delay was made up enroute  the bag appeared  when I reached  baggage carousel. Advance  booking and using  the few points (some I earned ) on this  journey made the  journey cheaper than  low cost carriers.  After BA renewing  the fleet the  journey seemed almost  perfect and all very enjoyable."
8.0,The Fiumicino - LHR Jun 1st  - Airbus 321. Great staff food  was poor I  would have been  willing to pay  more a better option.
1.0,Reviewed June 8th.  Four days after  arriving I departed  much less my check-in bag from  June 6th. Flight  selection this is  more often than  not on most BA flights I ve been on.  Nothing offered in economy same Chicken  Salad sandwich or  Caesar salad as  offered on last  two flights in a week on  all routes. I 'd rather have the option to buy something I  really want to  eat Cabin crew Brilliant nearly always are but its not just about  cabin crew service ; it's the  only reason they have any customers.
5.0,"My outward trip  between - Heathrow  - Milan was  smooth with even a guide to  direct us to  a connection at LHR Terminal 5. The return trip  from - Heathrow  - Manchester was  not so good.  the system would  only let me  go online and  even being the first in the queue at airport check-in we had  already been allocated  seats right at the back (we discovered on boarding  but no plan  or explanation given  during check-in) with  the recline. Both  trips were late  arriving at Heathrow especially the communication  was poor: at  one point the  pilot said 'Please wait' then there was a 'last ', even though  the gate had  never yet opened;  security staff seemed  confused at the  airport no explanation or apology were  provided unless they were in the  flight announcement but  I doubt it  as it was  very short. Having  landed at Munich  airport check in  was 1.30pm we  only got to  Munich at 9pm , too late  so the pilot  picked up some  of the lost  luggage (all excellent pilots by the ). But during  this time the  main refreshments were  one small packet  of crisps and  a drink twice. Not impressive although  most staff on  board were friendly  and polite."
9.0,Welcome to DXB : Outbound flight  was 2 hours  early as well  and it took over an hour to clear security.  Economy lounge quiet  good food and  beverage Jumbo on  way out new interior new and  improved good entertainment  and attentive crew food as usual  - - (recommend  to always eat  in the airport which given cost  per flight one really shouldn't have .) Inbound flight  is a 777.  As on way  out as on  way in except  arriving on time  I must commend  our crew members for their endless  service with one  heck of a  777
5.0,"We just flew round trip on the new A380 from LAX to LHR (and then  on to Rome).  Their A380 business class area was nice and the food was decent. However the layout of the seats  was great (you have to jump  on the person  next to you when they have  a seat in a flat position). Also avoid the aisle seats as  you feel like  sitting out in  the open and  they are constantly  walking by. As  well the seats  in the aisle have zero storage space so you are constantly getting up to get things out of the storage bin above you or losing them under  your seat. The BA lounge in LAX was ok  to great (although the food was decent) and their  VIP Lounge in  the Terminal 5 was just ok - very busy and crammed with people. Nowhere to  relax and enjoy  the downtime. The  service was the  best we've ever  experienced in a lounge (only things  really were horrible  - sandwiches a  couple cookies and  chips Since LHR is the hub  for BA we expected way more.  But our biggest issue was with the staff on  ALL the flights. They were highly  lacking in quality. Some were very  nice and helpful  but were beyond rude. I had read that British  Airlines now has a new system  and the same staff does not do the same  job on a  consistent basis. There  is apparently a lot of ""floaters"" who come and  sit and work different flights by ). To me this seems like a big mistake , most likely  explains the huge discrepancy in service.  My flight home was an hour late (BA seems  to be late  A lot based on the many reviews). They also  managed to lose  all of our  business We travel  very lot and will no longer  fly British Airways as it's too much of a ""Russian Roulette"" as  on whether your  flight will be  delayed or not."
6.0,"We travelled Club Europe from Gatwick to Paphos as we were going out to get  married The extra  space was handy  thanks to the  flights and all the extras that we needed to  pack but we  should have paid  for the extra space at much less a cost.  Because it was our wedding we decided to treat ourselves and go  out full hog so spent nearly £1000 extra on  club Europe seats  just to get a really good experience. Check in  went quick and  simple but there  were no queue  at the normal check in either  but we didn't really benefit from that. The lounge was nothing particularly  bad although we didn't get there with much time to spare so that was more our fault. We  was let on  to plane first through the front  door the plane the problem was that the rest of the passengers also came through  the same door  going through the  Clubs Europe section  and to be able to put  our bags up into the compartment I had to  stand by my  side until the  first plane had boarded. The seating then was just a row of 3 seats with the middle seat blocked off so although there was ""extra room"" it wasn't what I'd have expected. Our bags were marked as priority with  numbered tags but came out with  every rest of the luggage. I don't know if  anyone went in expecting more than  we should have but for the extra money we  spent I think we were entitled to have higher expectations. Not an  easy way to start our wedding !! We'd never  do Club Europe again it was  the complete waste of money so hopefully others will read this and save the money to spend on  they rest of the holiday!"
7.0,LHR-ATH-LHR outbound 6th June. Check in and lounge good as normal at T5' boarding done by bus which I always find odd at the  time hub seat  but on an A320 I like BA's club Europe and this flight was no different.  Very happy crew and the food English breakfast was pretty good flight arrived on time  and off quickly. Return 9th June  checked in at ATH airport quick and polite used  the lounge which is ok but pretty full with 2 flights leaving about an hour apart. Boarding quick seat 2A and  my A320 appeared a bit older but comfortable enough for a 3hr30min  friendly crew again friendly meal service was lunch which was ok arrival T5 on time and on a gate this time. I read some reviews on here I've travelled a lot with many airlines in economy premium economy business and first have to say my experience with BA has been mostly very positive. Everyone can have an off day.
2.0,Chicago (LHR) to  London (IAH) to London (LHR). T5  to Heathrow is  busy We been  up and down  2 lifts and  a train to  the gates. We  are boarding first  10 people comes  onto the plane.  On the plane  getting ready to  lift off then  half hour later  getting ready to  go out to  other people then  wait until 1 am before we  boarded The seat  is uncomfortable old  people tired. The  Flight Crew were  very miserable.
1.0,Travelling from Venice to London Gatwick  on British Airways  on what should  have been a  fairly short flight . How wrong  I was. Held  a boarding queue  of about 20  mins with no . Then got  a flight to  where no crew  would help passengers  and economy with  their stowing luggage . I was  sat in very  back row and  became apparent that  the crew were  right at the  controls having a  laugh A large  majority of the  people on this  flight were elderly  requiring help putting  second hand baggage  into the overhead  seat Did the  staff bother to look or help? No. They were  chatting up the  aisle in the  aisle having a right old laugh. Only when we  stopped taxi-ing could  they be bothered to finish their  business and do  their lacklustre safety . Which I  could see as  a crew member  that was right  near the front  on the plane.  We couldn't hear the pilot announcement  because the audio  is faulty. No  telling what he  said or what  weather conditions were.  As a nervous  person this is  never great. Took  photos and then  my crew started  food service. The  drinks I couldn't  drink as allergic  to one of  their ingredients and  so there was  some other option.  Easy enough. Was  given a drink about 20 mins  before landing. Just  so well I had my own  drink I guess.  The crew member 's locker above  her head on  takeoff and her  cap fell out  onto my head.  Not painful per  usual but didn't get apology from  crew member at  first She looked  after me like  this was my  fault I fly  with quite a  bit and usually  without much of  any issue. I  found the service  of this flight  but really. I'm  still pinching myself  and think it  was actually BA.  I left the flight feeling angry and slightly depressed  as this is  not the standard  response from BA.  The plane was  showing no map  with seats broken  leg rests and  nothing in- flight . I really  must now try  to find other  planes for both UK and International  flights from now  onwards where-ever possible.
5.0,"LHR-VIE on an A319. Online check-in  didnt start working until about 15 hours before the  trip Selected 13F on a very full flight. Selected ""collect at the "" option. Suddenly 8E a middle seat. No aircraft swap no explanation no apology. Boarding pass failed to  arrive at security an error somewhere in the system told security that  pass had already been used allegedly  Before I even got to the  gate Boarding not  uncommon with a  local bus getting a tour of  the Flight 15  hours late due  the congestion at  gate Service efficient but not overly friendly. Much prefer  Virgin on this route and will return to them for my next  flight A shame as BA should be a world beater - I'd  only flown with  it for about a year and it bought back  everything as to why I choose ."
10.0,We flew LAX to LHR on the new A380-800 in Club World. Flight was on time. The flight attendants were pleasant.  Service was excellent. There was a huge choice of  films to watch.  The lie-flat seats were very comfortable.  i am definitely going to fly British Airways again.
10.0,- This route  used the new  Virgin which I  am very much  looking forward to travelling on it  but did not  because I paid £20 extra to  get seats in the upper deck  and the very  reason this area  has only 4  people separated by galley and toilets  it really does feel like its  your private cabin.  Using the seating on the upper  decks in a  new layout means  it by the  way not only  its more spacious  because you only  have 1 person next to you but due to  this shape of  a A380 you get huge amounts  extra shoulder room  and access to  the storage lockers  by the window.  Sadly Virgin UC  was my last  trip to LA in a tired  and dated aircraft and BA economy  very welcome. Can not recommend BA enough.
10.0,Flight to AMS. Easy check-in at  BA with the  ability to check  in and print boarding pass. Did  it the night  shift as staying at an airport ? Easy and  easy to drop  a bag. Departure  time easy to  find Controlled boarding. Pleasant staff and  a snack on  the flight. Well  equipped and far  enough to use  a T5 at  BA if you  have the choice.  It took a  little time to  arrive at AMS  but that is  my issue rather  that BA.
1.0,I really do not have the energy to write very detail of how bad my very recent flight  to (and from) Vegas was with BA however I can categorically state I will never  fly with them again and am bewildered as to how they survive  a superior option as an airline.  Highlights of my journey include: Severe overheating on flight complaints ignored until someone fainted. Delayed on runway for 90 minutes for what was described as catering reasons. Running out of food and beverage  1 hr into a 11 hour flight. (No beer 1 hr in  the flight - after the 90 minute delay). Uninterested and incompetent staff. Lost luggage. (1 case has so far turned up). Space reduced to less than a foot (Head to back of seat) once person in front inevitably reclines. I could honestly  go on and on about how bad an experience this flight was and am being  totally honest when I say that I am an easy customer to please. If you have Virgin as an option even its a bit more expensive please  taking my word  to it and go with them  who are a class apart. BA operate as a  luxury budget airline posing as something else. Very poor journey shocking experience.
4.0,"Flew in Club World for the  last time on the new BA A380s. Big disappointment.  These two upper  level cabins feel  spacious with more  space than the  flight deck of a 747 yet  with fewer staff per passenger and too few toilets. The dinner service  for the LHR-JNB flight was chronically slow (about three  hour from beginning  until end). The staff have been  instructed to deliver  dinner by hand  to the galleys  rather than from  the trolley) and to plate all  passengers meals. All this takes too  long with this  kind of staffing  as the passenger  satisfaction suffers. The  flight crew were  a curiously bad , perhaps due  too the frustration  at trying to  provide an over worked meal service  for increasingly disgruntled passengers. A pity as the planes  are quieter than  previous generation aircraft  yet the flight was very smooth."
2.0,Flying in Business on B-747. Hard to find much good to say  regarding this experience. Everything about the trip was chaotic  or disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight  delay by 90 minutes as they  could get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took  FAR too long than it should've to resolve. And  To make it all worse BA  had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag  NOT making it  to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and  its IFE limited  was appalling. The  most positive thing  we can say was the crew  apologised a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested  they were trying.  Just imagine how  you can compete with SQ on  the route given  that absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline  that it is today. They have  no idea where  your bag is or when I will get it and you can't  get BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One  just gets the impression they couldn't  do less. Would  not recommend.
9.0,"Back to BOS.  Waiting after baggage  went down but First check in easy and security  cleared Super breakfast  and Concorde Room.  BA then delayed for 2 hours  and all on  arrival but crew  was great. Food , wine superb  & service was BA at it's very best."
6.0,LHR-ARN. All the  flights at Heathrow  Level 5 were a breeze. There  were some kind of baggage delivery  issue at check-in but the staff  took it very well smiling and being professional. The  plane went on  my old dirty and worn out A319 though seats  where comfortable. The  atmosphere was of  an intra European flight: light cold snacks and drinks flight attendants were  attentive Overall I  would use BA  into the future . I would  be flying a newer plane next  time
2.0,"LHR-ATH-ATH June 2014.  Started flights 1.5  hrs late which  always seems to  me the case , due to  an old plane  they used on  this particular flight.  Poor average cabin  and variable-average overall.  My apologies for  lack of flights , unacceptable-BA still  seems to think , they are doing you a  favour for letting  me fly with  BA Poor overall  I am even  now using Easyjet as Gatwick closer to my home."
9.0,"Sao Paulo - London Heathrow Club  - Sat in the upper deck  of the 747.  Nice experience. Very comfortable flight with attentive helpful cabin crew. Reasonable food , selection of drinks and good  service"
10.0,"Fly from Barbados  via London Gatwick , then onwards  towards Italy using  British Airways in  three instances. Returned  at Gatwick on  January 28 and  again travelled by  air to Barbados.  Customer experience in  both instances was  extremely positive. The  flight crew on  all flights accommodated  to every request.  All food was  cooked at the  right temperature at  certain intervals and  very tasty. I  would definitely use  that airline again."
7.0,"Welcome to BKK  from club world  wide night flight.  Breakfast at T5 . Nice choice  of hot foods , and snacks.  Love the spa  room I really  liked the club . seats very  good for sleeping.  Very tasty had  the pasta. Good  choice of films.  Lots of crew  the club did  a great job  - get the  occasional one here  or there that  is surly and  arrogant - make you feel as  though they are  paying you a  lot I always  go and fly  in on the  way a great  night"
5.0,Flew YVR to  London via LHR. I had high expectations for this  flight but was  extremely disappointed. We were flying with twin 15 month olds so it's  standard with BA  so you can  check the bassinet spots when booking.  BA did bare minimum seemed as  though asking for anything was a  huge inconvenience. Audio on IFE was  terrible couldn't hear any movies. Flight  was 10 minutes late in London and we were  late boarding on  a MUC flight due to being late. If they allow a connection  for 1h10 and  arrive 10 minutes late and can't get on their  system is flawed.  There are any  BA flights not 10 mins late! They rebooked us  2 hours later but after complaining  booked us on  the Lufthansa flight 1 hour later.  We never thought I would say  this but will  recommend Air Canada  on this route from now on if the price is equal.
9.0,First Economy on  Airbus A320. Plane seemed brand new. Was seated in 8C towards the  back of Economy and that's obviously a seat that  gets configured for Club Europe from time to time as the seat  itself was pretty . Complimentary breakfast  consists of coffee and a filled  sandwich was perfectly OK. Service efficient. Flight left and landed on time.  Good stuff really. No complaints at all.
8.0,"Gatwick to Malaga , May. I 've travelled this  route literally hundreds of times the number of airlines  who have or currently operate this route over the years gives a good choice of  flight times and  routes However I find myself using BA as the norm. The flights are well priced usually on time the aircraft are  clean and comfortable although they could be newer. Legroom is great especially if you can bag a seat  on the first eight rows these  give 34 inches of legroom. Organised boarding makes a  big positive difference as well."
4.0,"Just back from  Manchester to Gatwick Friday 30th May. This flight proved that it is  airline crew that make a good or bad flight.  That one was really bad. I  was booked in  and normally the  aircraft is a three class 777.  Last Friday it was a four  flight that was flying and I was lucky enough  to be seated  in the First Class cabin. Although  it was not  booked as an upgrade to First  Class it was business class service  so should still have been a lovely experience. Yes the seat and  all the space was great but the first words  I heard as  being offered a drink was -  just wait for this flight to be over"". This  was from one  on the stewards to another steward but that attitude was the same  for all the crew serving the  flight I hope BA read this forum as the  experience really was  disappointing My husband was in the bathroom when breakfast  is served he  completely ignored. A  request of a  pot of coffee was met with  he will be landing in 40 minutes. So what should have been  one real treat turned out to be the most  disappointing I have ever been with BA. Will no  one recommend."
9.0,We flew from London to Milan  airport on 27th May 2014. Firstly the booking process was quick and easy and was matched by an efficient check-in and bag drop procedure too. The staff were well turned out and other  then one cabin  crew member the cabin staff were  professional and polite.  Our airbus was modern and comfortable.  Free snack and drink was served  on this flight and it was  nice to see screen showing the route map of  each flight. Disembarkation was orderly and well managed. I hope to use BA again the in the near  term
1.0,Back to Sydney  via Heathrow and  Clubs Club Europe . Dublin to  Sydney and club  European to Sydney.  London to Heathrow delayed 40 mins  owing to weather  which was fine.  Upon arrival in  Sydney waited for  an hour for  the bus transfer  giving us 30  minutes to make  my next flight.  On boarding the  last bus another  20 mins delayed. By this time  it was about . Obviously missed  the connecting flight  in Sydney so  managed to find  any BA contact  from terminal 4.  They then advised  to go to  Terminal 1. No  airline reps around and no 24  hour phone number.  So transferred to  gate 5. By  this time it  was midnight and  also no BA . Finally went  to baggage services  but saw a  security rep that  had no idea  anything was going  down and sent  us to the  first class lounge  that was closed.  Luckily someone appeared  around 1am who  cleared out our  baggage room and  explained the delay  being caused by  rain they provided  me with the  options of flying  home to Sydney  via BA or  then see if  they could get  us on a  China Southern flight (we had originally  chosen China Southern).  I took the  first option as  it was easiest  but needed to  fly home. Next day arrived at airport and boarded  from Gate C  ( terminal 5  at Heathrow airport).  Flight in Heathrow  went fine over cast but fine.  When boarding the  new business class  plane we were  all disappointed to say the least.  Very old aircraft  type and the  seat configuration was . We had the two middle  seats E and  F which were  all backwards however  our seats on  the sides are  not close facing  to you. Flight  left on time  and arrived in  Sydney on time.  There was a  bit of an  incident in Singapore  but again that  could be helped.  There were also  unaware of the  security passes which  were annoying and  also lost our  luggage - luckily  it arrived two  minutes later. Good  news if you're  trying to sleep  through the flight.  Rooms were small  so very uncomfortable.  All amenity kits  were ok however they ran out  of eye masks.  No hit towels  or anything but . Food was  just average. Overall  i wouldn't recommend  British Airways Club  Europe The best I've experienced so  Far from Sydney  and Europe would  appear to be  with China Southern.  While they are 2-3 grand cheaper  than British Airways  and they offer  the better business  class product and  a more seamless  boarding process.
8.0,London City to  Dublin Heathrow on  20 May 2014. I travelled in  business class on  the domestic flight  over the Irish  Republic The flight experience with BA  was with a pleasant check-in agent who made sure I knew where I was going  – and was  easily equalled by  well groomed and  attentive cabin crew.  A small drink and a biscuit  were offered on this route. The  airline kept the passengers informed of  the route and  it was on time and disembarkation . My only complaint was that  the announcement in  BA was not clear and was made by somebody  which was hard to understand.
7.0,I 214 in  a late spring os a 747-400. Lie-flat seats were ok but still difficult to sleep on. Seats alternated  to face-front and face-rear so when the privacy screen is down you are looking directly at the other person. Service was  good with an optional dinner and  dessert and a variety of drinks.  My basket was  open all night. Business class was nice but not sure it is worth the extra .
5.0,"MCT-LHR-MAN and LHR-MCT I think you need to fly  these every so often to remind  people why you  would do it  even more. The  second flight was  very poor -  no check in  or landing. Although they have now  upgraded the aircraft  for this route  and the IFE  is better they still treat the  planes as self-loading  - It took  me 3 hours to get a  cabin - the  passengers were cheerful they simply didn't  know anything. A  long flight and  at least one  day out of  10 was an  absolute pain. Transit through LHR is always an unalloyed joy and this  time I had  to go through  it which added  to the fun but despite this I still had  energy for a very quick shower  before flights - hooray and full  pay for the  airline staff. LHR  and MAN was  better Coming back  so much better  - crew were  friendly and pro-active , the food  is actually edible  and if all  future flights were like this I would use them more - I only used them  last time because  I have axed  the route temporarily while the work  of the Dubai  airport is happening."
10.0,Flight 777. One  on our best  flights from Europe.  Everything was done  will make us  comfortable including showing  a technically challenged  how to work the numerous controls.  Excellent selection of  flights and shows.  Beer and wine  service was good  as the prep  is quite good.  Service was very  nice especially compared  with the 747 s flight we  took
6.0,Tampa-Gatwick. Check in lousy. I can't  believe I am writing this. Checking in 3 bags  which weighed 32.7 kg the supervisor insisted I remove the .7kg (1lb) from the bag. I had to ask him if he was serious and he said he was. The person checking in  close to me had the same problem. When you fly business class the reason you do is because you don't want  hassle this strictness doesn't help. Tampa airport didn't help the stress level . I had one carry on bag rucksack and a small bag for a laptop security to the  right insisted I  was allowed two carry on's so I had to put two bags into one. Going  through the third security the scanner showed I had something in my pocket. Body search revealed I had a few $ 5 in my  wallet Security man 'when we say remove everything from your pocket we mean everything' I thought he was joking he wasn't. Lounge at Tampa Ok. Sandwiches freshly made and plenty of drinks reasonable . Option of going to one world lounge as  well Boarding aircraft clean all seats in club taken  by champagne by  the friendly cabin crew. Food usual just edible (insulting  the passengers as you are paying business class monies) flight landed late. Baggage collection happy to see two of my check in's come out first and sad to see the  final bag come out last as the priority tag had got removed  in the last bag.
2.0,A long time  user of BA I have seen a gradual decline in quality now  into freefall and the LHR-PHX-LHR route that I use monthly has become more akin to  flying in a cattle truck than  the B747. Old  engines with tatty interiors are the norm legroom is extremely limited the aircraft is seldom what you would call clean and the crews give  the impression they  were almost putting themselves out to serve you. Food is not worthy  for the name and the whole experience is an utterly miserable 10 hours of your life each leg.  This is enough  that 1st June  is the last time I'll use the outbound flight as I'm switching across to United 's ORD in . OK it  is a changeover  from Chicago but  this recent experience  is a refreshing  departure from BA and I actually felt like I  actually wanted on the United flights.
5.0,"Boeing 767 Club Europe to Istanbul  & back. The  chairs were tatty  with very worn leg room limited  At best thankfully the passenger in front on both legs did not  damage their seats. The head rests  were hanging off as are parts  in the cabin.  Fast food was ok but turning  over a ""plastic ,"" upside down into the china bowl in front of you isn't  so great. Even though I know they do that  in the galley in first class it doesn't need  to be on  board Crew much  as inbound."
7.0,"Location Check in simple lounge at Gatwick average aircraft . Clean and departed on time. On board pleasant welcome food just about ok after  much research chose  the 4K window you won't disturb  when getting out.  You have to  board with mostly  nothing else that  you are small  seats facing a  window is quite odd. Cabin crew  and flight crew  great through out the flight which  left on time.  When booking Business as opposed to Eco or Eco  you should know , all you are really paying extra for is a cramped flat  cabin and allowance  of 3x32kg bag checked in instead of 2x23kg in Eco. Good films to choose from  but music naff as is the  flight Brought my  buds in ear Bose IQ20 headset  only for flights."
3.0,"My husband and I travelled to San Diego from Heathrow and back via JFK five weeks later. Service is appalling. Stewards are slightly more pleasant than the stewardesses who are particularly rude abrupt  sometimes lazy. Food is particularly foul and there was a long period of some hours (the flight to San Diego is 12 hours) without access to water or beverages. Dinner was produced a  short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. The journey from JFK was worse. Same problem with rude , disdainful stewardess. We paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more  padding had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the  person in front of me. Dinner was pretty awful and the next meal: breakfast comprised of a near frozen croissant. The problem is staff. There needs to be a senior manager travelling on these routes in 'cattle class' incognito - then they will understand what it is like to be treated with complete disdain."
6.0,Then flew on  March 29 to  Vancouver changing in  London and also  on 6th from  Barcelona to (via  - Barcelona then  the 17 from  Madrid - Heathrow)  back to Vancouver  and I was very pleased with  my service and meals and flight  attendant were great.  My only part  was that changing  to Heathrow was a bit of  the pain having  to wait to  get on the  computer re what  flight to go  through but otherwise everything was great.
1.0,I found BA to be the worst airline I  ever used. Flew LHR to Boston 2hr 56 min delay to start with. Cabin staff unhelpful and disinterested. Also leg room appalling with trim falling of the  plane in front of me. It  was the interior of an old knackered plane. I  had flown Singapore  Airlines who run rings around this bunch. I could  of flown with Virgin instead for the same money  I would have had a vastly superior less drab  experience
2.0,"Heathrow - Johannesburg A380. My first flight on A380. After half an hour delay because of planes late arrival boarding started.  First thing I noticed was how  uncomfortable the seats . Second thing to notice is that the plane  was not properly  cleaned There were grease stains and  beer cans left behind. At this point I noticed  the toilet paper between the panels  above my head.  When asked the  Cabin crew explained this is how they fixed condensation  leaks from the air conditioning. Anyhow time for lift off. I turned on the inflight entertainment system to watch it from the camera at  far tail of  my plane. After  searching for 5 minutes I couldn't find it anywhere. (Later I found  that there is no such option on BA A380s).  So no tail  is fine let's  come to some  entertainment Wrong the headphones are not  functional Cabin crew assures me they will ""bring me  some more"". One hour later suffice  that to say cabin crew did  indeed bring anything.  Somehow managed to  get a pair  more unused headphones from one empty  seat just to find out they were not working either. Probably it  was some problem  with the jack  on the seat  and the whole  cabin entertainment system . And if that was not enough it was time for dinner.  At the time it was my  dinner BA had  run out of ""chicken"" so my  meal was asparagus with rice or something like that. You don't even have to look at it to  understand why everyone else was choosing  only ""chicken"". So no edible dinner and soundless entertainment system. Pretty much spent the rest of the journey  in the minutes  that I could  take off this  flight The worst  part is I  have a return  ticket with BA  so I'll be  sure to switch to another airline  when possible."
8.0,Club Europe London Heathrow T3 to  London T3 lounge  - good. Boarding fine and helpful but it is disappointing that this flight consistently requires a bus to link the terminal to the plane  or that there is no specific  shuttle for Club Europe passengers. There 's little point in fast tracking  you at other stages of the journey to ignore  passengers at this point. Good flight  and cabin crew - why can't BA have a consistency of cabin crew quality? Today's crew were excellent - attentive engaged appropriately friendly and amusing and consistent  in their service throughput the flight.  Handling was fine champagne improved from  recent flights. Quality  of cabin still  disappointing - upgrade of the cabins really should be a priority but I fear that BA's focus is on the long haul not those  amongst us who travel within Europe. Efficient upon arriving  at Lisbon.
6.0,"London - Johannesburg.  Great lounge comfortable  as always. A little underwhelmed at  times by first  flight on the A380 not as  clean or appealing  that I had  hoped However it  provided all that  you needed including  a very good  breakfast for the IFE. Had the  same taster menu  with different wines  including those which  were suggested. Was  pretty good indeed , not have  the dessert but  for better half  was it outstanding.  It arrived at  same time as  the other long-haul  passengers so immigration  being a pain  but not much  we can do  for that."
5.0,From Heathrow to Madrid Club Euro.  Overall service perfunctory at best with cabin crew spending much of the flight hiding behind their curtain. Full  service but it has to be  asked why we continue to pay extra when the service is so disappointing. Flight itself was fine cabin itself not as  great as some BA short haul. Good experience at  departure lounge at . The afternoon tea product continues to underwhelm and underfeed - they really should change this.
9.0,From TXL-LHR on  Airbus A321 it  is an uneventful  flight drinks were served. Transfer at  BA was uneventful  but I think  maybe BA should  change their gate  number beforehand. LHR-SFO  on Boeing 747-400.  It was a  year old and  the volume was  very low. Movie  viewing was okay.  Overall it was  very pleasant journey.
6.0,"Air Diego return  first class (the  seat was more  expensive than the  economy class one).  My usual plane  - fine service was OK but  very attentive (i.e . about OK).  It was terrible  - have flown  both in economy  class and first  class and never  had good or  good quality food.  Had they upped  the game on  food they would  become unbeatable. Entertainment  is dire -  at least first had a few good ""box sets""  of TV programmes. My wife was  flying in economy  - her comment  is that the  first traveller plus  her gave her  nothing - the  economy seat was . Her food  is inedible."
10.0,From British Airways  Air Sydney to  Madrid on 22nd  February and return  in May from  Spain From Sydney  Check in staff  were courteous and  helpful Cabin crew  just as wonderful . Check in  Barcelona Food out  from Sydney awful. Return journey was  from Barcelona. Again  Check in Staff  were wonderful and  friendly Cabin crew  were as wonderful  as food was  awful
3.0,"Recently returned from  Birmingham to Gatwick  at Club World and have to say that the service was woefully lacking. Left on time. The cabin crew were obviously tired and the  odd glass of  wine was served without smiles or a welcome. Throughout the whole flight the crew did the absolute minimum  so there was  so little interaction  with the passengers. Breakfast was disgusting  and served soon after take-off. A little round casserole dish of British Breakfast ingredients all  mixed together and  served hot and overcooked and tasteless.  And insipid coffee. After that some  of the crew  went for a sleep and we  all left to  ourselves Nobody asked if we wanted  coffee nobody chatted I rang for a drink and nobody came. The  cabin 'kitchen/snack bar'  was almost bare  and had two manky stale smoked-salmon sandwiches and a  couple bottles of  wine On asking  for a glass  There were none)  of wine I was told to sit down and  there would be  back as indeed  there was ten minutes later with no smiles or  welcome Throughout the flight I felt guilty asking for a G&T or  something because of  a negative attitude  towards certain cabin  staff Lunch was just about OK and very good wine. After that for the next five hours nothing  was served to  greet us before landing - no  coffee no cakes  - nothing. The  flight configuration was  cramped (Boeing 777) and packed in  plastic sardines -  even for some.  to access the  cabin from the  plane you have  a climb over the legs of  the person behind and the food  gets served across  the lap of  your aisle seat over the partition.  There were a  handful but if you are travelling  internationally it could  allow for some very strange eye-to-eye contact with a stranger. The IFE  is dated and  a very limited choice with poor quality fuzzy screens. The whole package  felt so minimal soulless and lacking. Not once were  you made to  appear special or 'pampered' in any  way If there  was an alternative  in future to BA I'll take it and compared  with some Middle-East  airline the Club  World product is embarrassingly mediocre. BA needs to refresh review and up-date  - Sorry BA , you've lost me for the  near future!"
7.0,"Off to Barbados  and back. After  receiving some bad reviews we were  pleased with the  weather and food , both ways  we had a  fantastic crew. Shame  those films were  released on demand  upon the return !"
10.0,"London Heathrow to  Southampton on a  BA 767-300. The outward flight was on a plane  designed for Worldwide  travel i.e. with Club World World  Class Plus and  Premium Traveller classes.  It was one  of the newly  introduced ones. The economy cabin at 2-3-2 and leg room was excellent  as I am  6 foot tall.  Breakfast of a  very nice chicken  and complimentary alcoholic  beverage with a  short run. Staff  were efficient and friendly. We are Silver members of  our Exec Club and the Cabin Service Director welcomed  everyone by name.  on time departure  but slightly early , The return flight was on a standard European  Airways aircraft but space was as  tight as the  original journey. On time departure and arrived into Heathrow  15 minutes early.  Overall a great  flight"
2.0,"Now for our honeymoon we took advantage of a BA promo to fly in to  Singapore and then to Hong Kong via Cathay Pacific  flying back to . Our flight out to Singapore  was easy and  pleasant because I think it was not a busy flight. We did  ask to have  the wedding photo  album to be  flown in to save us the hassle of lugging  everything around but was flatly refused. The canvas was less than 1kg  when packed for delivery but just slightly awkward to be carried around. We understand BA  have a one  way check in policy and no  baggage but we were not too  upset anyway although  any little kind gesture would have been appreciated. Our flight on Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong was great! We were allowed to check in 3 pieces of  luggage between 2  of us that  weighed less than  Our food was fantastic and the service was immaculate.  For our way  up to London  we were excited as we knew we were flying the A380. SQ and Emirates have A380 we have . This turned out to be a mistake from  we start. When we were checking in we were  not allowed to  carry in extra hand luggage despite the combined weight  being less than 40kg for all 3 items. When  I got on the plane we  was shocked to see how tiny the seats on  our BA A380 were in comparison to SQ or even Emirates. Next we struggled to find an overhead  luggage compartment for  extra hand luggage.  A staff instead  started helping us find a space  for the bag  sat on her spot pointing at cabins that looked  empty but were  literally over rows away from our seats. The ultimate bad experience came when breakfast was served. By the time the trolley  got to us  our were no  available options for our breakfast and  the food was  just plonked on our trays. No  interaction no explanations as to what was under the foil no smiles!  This was quite  late by now  as I had  to ask the  staff what was being served. I have never felt more humiliated. With  staff it was  just silence. Miserable  and lifeless crews  at work who can't seem to  be less with their customers. No smiles no interactions no explanations no communication. Needless to say the highly  recommended dim sum with noodles for breakfast was left untouched! Our overall flying experience with BA has been anything but pleasant friendly generous comfortable , delicious meals.  I had just  acted as a reminder why I  had not chosen BA the last 10 years and perhaps the next  few to come."
7.0,Gatwick-Venice return. Two contrasting experiences. Trip out pretty good A320 so much better than the old 737's used at Gatwick. Staff friendly and a good snack and beverage included. Good updates from cabin and we left and arrived on time. Trip back felt like it had been crewed by brand new staff in the  cabin Food handed out 20 mins after take-off but drinks took another 30 mins to be offered around cabin. Half the cabin crew seemed  quite pre-occupied with passengers not sitting in correct seat even though flight not full. Think a smile and re-assurance to move back after take-off would have sorted the issue however one female crew member in particular had forgotten to bring her 'happy face' to work that day! Flight OK but not up to standard you expect. I fly BA quite regularly and choose over EasyJet as fares and flight times often similar but service superior. I hope the Gatwick service levels can reflect the BA brand otherwise  they have an  obvious competitor in EJ at this airport.
10.0,1st Class LHR-PHX.  Great seamless flight. Great driver collection  and concierge service  if it was extra). Concorde room was lovely great  service and nice breakfast. First class  & onboard staff were very good. Producing a very  nice custom meal  with my wife.
1.0,"When we booked  our holiday to  India I was  quite pleased to see we were  going with British  Airways as they  offered a good  deal Sadly our  experience put a  stop to this. As part of the service they offer BA allow  YOU to either pay an expensive  amount to choose your seats in  London or you  could log onto  the website for free 24 hours ' advance. I  had to do this several times  without success and finally rang the  first number suggested.  During a 14 minute call at premium rate the  flight operator (whose grasp of English  was great) was unable to advise about the problem nor manually book  any seats and  did offer nothing more constructive than  "" trying”. I rang the complaints line (still premium rate) and other  having a better  grasp of English  were still unable  too assist in any way. Both  agents assured me  they they would  fix it all  in the Airport.  Keeping in view  all this we  failed to arrive  at the airport . We entered  seat details online to find that even though there  are only 2 of us we weren't sat together or even on  that same row.  By now my wife – who is a nervous flyer – was in tears! We  both sought assistance  and had to  wait but eventually  were allocated 2  seats together. As  they were free  we don't know why these weren't given originally – however given our further experiences – maybe they don't like using them? I have flown  longer haul before and found that you always get  a more generous  use of space particularly shoulder and  thigh Sadly British  airlines don't appear  too follow this doctrine. The legroom was adequate however as soon as the woman in front reclined her seat I had about 4 inches between the front of my nose  to the back of her seat.  Since my TV  remote is in  one back of  my seat it made trying to watch the screen  extremely difficult. I  attempted to watch  the film however this brought on a headache so  I was forced  into stop. I  will love to see what regulations  we have to  enforce regarding VDU  seating however in  my work environment this would be banned without question. The final disappointment came when the  meal was distributed. I had the  Fried Chicken which  was over-cooked so that the rice  got cremated to  the top and  back of the  chicken whilst my  daughter had the cottage pie which tasted of plastic. She didn't eat hers. I ate mine but had  a stomach upset for the following 48 hours. All in all this  was an experience  i do not  wish to repeat and I shall certainly not fly British Airways by choice in the  UK We didn't  have these problems  in Sri Lanka <mask>"
2.0,"Australia on 29  February and Antigua-LGW on 13 May Boeing 777. It  started off badly . I went  the pay the final payment on  arrival on evening  on 16 February.  The system rejected  both my credit and debit cards.  On checking the  details of my  account with BA . I found that the final  amount had been  sent to my  card and I  was owed the  last deposit. I  wrote an email  asking get it  resolved only to receive a reply  stating it could  only be sorted out by a  conference call. First  line was useless  to a person  and had poor  grasp of English.  Next call to  the premium number  meant a 20 minute wait to get someone to  sort out the  details having been  called round twice. I was told  everything had been sorted out and received E ticket  along with my  details of account  that I owed ! Two weeks  on I received  an E ticket  The only difference  there was that it showed the  last four digits  for my credit card. Next credit card statement did  NOT show money  taken out. Not unusual for some companies but made me nervous that  it was not well. Two weeks  before flight I  receive a phone  call from BA  stating that there  had been a  computer glitch and  that they have  lost credit card details. I then  got an email  reply and confirmation  it had been . About 22  hours before flight  we went online  at check in and changed my  ticket and entered  travel details etc  on printed boarding  pass Arrived at LGW to just  change baggage labels and drop off baggage. Met by  man at terminal who tore up  the boarding pass , printed off a new one  using ‘bring back  the old system.  I then had to queue to drop off baggage.  More than choosing  airlines it was  the complete waste  on time to  get in online.  I left and  returned on time.  On the inflight  breakfast meal was  the worst I have ever experienced  on an aircraft.  It was no  bread and the red wine was  bad The inflight food on my  next flight a  smooth trooping flight to Singapore in  May was better.  For return flight you could only  check in online and alter seat  position Check in  to Antigua was  one of the  worse check ins  i have ever  experienced Left Antigua  on time and  reached LGW on  time Food was worse than going . No choice. Starter was small  rolled up lettuce  salad with small  lemon wedge with  the rotten end to it. Main  course very dry  salad with a tomato sauce on  top White wine was just about . Coffee served as we started  the course. Asked  how we could  drink it later  were told no  because turbulence was expected. No turbulence <mask> cabin crew <mask> to clear up and disappear <mask> a bit of shut eye <mask> minimum staff <mask> duty. At <mask> with Ryanair <mask> know what <mask> get for your money."
6.0,"LHR-JTR-LHR. A tale  if opposites for BA's new route  into Santorini. Outward it couldn't have been better with  a FAs decent  takeoff and arrival that was ahead of schedule. The return started off poorly with substandard facilities at Santorini airport including no online check-in no business class lounge , no priority boarding. An air  traffic controller issue kept the plane grounded for 30 minutes. On board they'd forgotten the menus for the dinner service and the starter and cheese course had been left behind.  BA Club Europe toilet then ran out of water.  Overall overall okay but the return  was disappointing."
3.0,"Flying as a  group of 4 (2 adults and  two young children)  in London to  America I hoped  it wouldn't be  a problem sitting  down in the 4 middle seats.  I had not  tried to reserve  a seat as  we had never  bothered to pay  this before while  traveling with Emirates  airline or Cathay . The seats  reserved at check  out were 3 on the left  so My wife  stayed with the  kids while I  chose to sit  in the row behind. The seats  could not be  changed at check  out or on  another plane. It  seemed ridiculous that  seats were not  on the logical  place for a  group of 4  at the middle of the plane  as though my  ticket had been  prepared 5 months  in advance. I  asked the stewardess  as the situation  would be difficult  on my family , the staff  or the passengers  alike as this  happened when my  4 year old  complained as he  refused to sit  closer to me.  He had to  change seats with  the wife a couple of times  during the flight  that was a  longer flight. On the return flight  I reluctantly paid  extra (£23 x .) to make  sure we got the 4 middle  seat The journey  was less stressful  when my wife had her own  seats as she  did recline as  a passenger behind  is too tall  and refused to  stretch his legs  he should have  room and extra  room and reserved  the seat with  more leg room). My wife complained  and the steward ess the passenger  refused to let  my wife recline  she was made  the move to  another different seat.  In conclusion I  thought staff were generally friendly but  they exert themselves on service the  flight was okay  although the entertainment system was dated  it didn't have  many games and  no screen kept . It seems  that flight services  in USA are  not up to  a same standard  as flying to  The Middle East  and the Far  East as British  airlines had failed  the comparison at  many levels when  flying with the  other airlines mentioned  previously - my  first experience to the USA was  for American Airlines  - that was  worse than BA.  My main disappointing  thing with BA  was definitely having  to pay extra for choosing your  seats If you are travelling with a family of  four and you want to guarantee  everyone sit together  they have to  pay an extra  fee on top  off the original  price of the  airline ticket this  seems more like  2 additional charges  from Ryanair!"
9.0,London BA001 and  onwards Quick check  out and fast  through security although I had to show my boarding pass to get  to Gate 24 lounge with a view of our  flight and a  bottle of champagne. Quick boarding nice  welcome by a familiar face. Cabin has stood up  nicely and is  not fresh as it was on  arrival Starter choice  in Shannon now  supplemented by a selection of canapes served on a  large USA immigration  line forward and  not back on the aircraft but the airport is  full Once in  mid air salad drinks and a choice of mains. I had the curry which was excellent followed by chocolate fondant smothered  by chocloate sauce - bliss. Later  on the Friday 001 flight which departs at 1245 as opposed to 0945 they serve  dinner rather than afternoon tea. This was a plate of cold cuts and samosas.Tasty.Quick disembarkation lovely crew. Return  on 004 Sunday evening supper in the busy Galleries dining room. then quick boarding on  a full 31/32 . Supper served  for those who wanted it and  also a full hot English breakfast  bag or a bag to go. Bussed to the arrivals hall and  checked and then  off in 15 minutes. Excellent crew  and flight.
8.0,Flying in World  Class on a 747-400. After having  done 3 consecutive  years on AA  ( having been  so surprised) I wasn't sure how an old BA 747 would measure up but aircraft  were spotless and in full working . Crew were  friendly and helpful. The food was  also good and  generally IFE far better than AA.
2.0,"Got to Vegas , 8th May  2016 dismayed at the standard. Filthy  waiter back in  Front of me  sat with a  sandwich by a  woman Only choice  for meal was  some lemon pasta , some food  served up in  it was brought  home 3 chicken  wings to share . 6 of  our Sandwiches crisps  and nuts etc  were refused when  suggested as an alternative; we were  warned by the  manager not to  go in the  area we did  ( row 31)  get it normally . The worst  thing though was  the staff who  did come over  extremely rude."
7.0,"On a recent  trip from Sacramento to Paris some friends and I had a terrible experience with another  flight and had some trepidation about  a return flight  to Paris to Sacramento. We did however choose British Airways for the  Return flight and  neither of us had flown with  them before. I  am happy to report that the experience was totally different. Our flight was delayed by an hour which  would effect our layover and did  take us to our next flight but we had  the cushion of  3 hours layover  but we were ok. On the flight the seats  are more comfortable more leg room , noisy better entertainment due to  the on seats in front of you and the access to the  internet was much easier to navigate.  It also had  WiFi relatively together which the other airline refused to  offer us even  if we had  booked the reservation months in advance.  One screen was  too far ahead I couldn't see it and it  showed only one  screen The staff  seemed very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable. I will  definitely recommend British Airways for International flights to my  family"
1.0,I should be in a nice  place in Romania ! 9 hours after I arrived  to Heathrow courtesy  Of British Airways I am still  at Heathrow heading  home to Glasgow! The 7am flight  started well 10/10  mins getting me  from Glasgow to  Romania The connecting flight to Bucharest  was delayed by more than an  hr which meant  they wouldn't get  my connecting flight to Timisoara. I  finally went to  emergency services (waited  30 mins) who  said to get  out to Timisoara tomorrow about 3pm as the last  plane on 9/5/14  had fully booked. They offered to put me up  at a hotel in Bucharest but  were not able  too book one.  So waited 50 mins at a  reception desk where  although there was  anything they could  do to check availability of a hotel in Bucharest I was not filled with confidence.  As I was  booked out for only 48 hours and would miss  a large part of my meeting I decided to go back to Glasgow. I was  put on the  plane to Glasgow and given a  sheet of paper with all the details and told to go to  their gate when it was called  where they would  check all about  flight booking as  I was on the computer. Told my boarding pass  was sorted. They  duly sorted it and I got a lecture about  what I needed to do in future. There was  NO way I  am getting on the flight told  them I should be grateful as  they were doing  me a favour putting me on  their 6.50pm flight. Told to go back to the  ticket desk and  wait in the queue again!

10.0,08/5/2014 JFK-LHR-BRU. After the perfect outbound flight we thought that the inbound flight could not be the same.  Our lounge is JFK was very crowded and not really relaxed. Boarding  is again relaxed  with a perfect  seat on the Upper deck friendly  but relaxed. Slept nearly the all flight in perfect conditions. The flight  however was delayed  by more than 40 minutes but the captain excused humbly for the delay and gave us plenty of  space business cabin  is full but the service on  this short flight  is more than  perfect
8.0,"On return. Very  pleased with the  accommodation and crew  performance on the  return sections as the Belfast ones are only domestic , still excellent. I was impressed with the food  there was a  roast chicken dinner going out and  afternoon tea on  my return leg.  All crew were  absolutely exceptional and make this airline  special the seat pitch in Club  Lounge is poor.  The Galleries lounge  at T5 is just OK being  a bit of  the cattle market compared to the  airport longge in  London which was  excellent"
9.0,"Flight BRU-LHR-JFK. Short flight in business  form Brussels to  NYC was how  the short business  plane has to  be excellent crew  and food flight  landing on time. Flight from LHR  to JFK started  in perfect conditions:  nice lounge in  seat 5 (as  a gold member)  had excellent champagne  with food and  beverage Boarding was  nice with helpful  people a nice  staff to welcome  you on board , to relax  in a nice  dinner In one  case the start  to a perfect  day in a  private cabin landing  on time in  New York. This  was how it  really should be."
8.0,Many different people have different experiences  but wanted to share that I  had mixed reviews  that are great  and one can be used as  motivation while the  second for pat  on BA's backs! I was traveling BLR-LHR-SFO route on  8 of May 2014. The first flight from BLR-LHR  is chaotic and as mentioned by others on this site most food options were exhausted  at the end  of the flight. I don't complain  as I got my food choice. The flight staff  was some really courteous people while  passengers were pretty . The second  plane is really  not worth mentioning - it was  my most cheerful  plane I have  flown on! The  cabin attendants were  right the pains  and being on  this second leg  on a 24 hr journey was  well felt. BA 287 flying on 9th May 2014 - fantastic flight. Food was okay  - I loved  my Lily O ats chocolate mousse!  Also - its  probably time BA upgrades its entertainment systems. The audio was lousy and  it was clear  but audible even  in the highest  settings against the  loud sounds.
10.0,Yet again a good flight from  London to Warsaw  with an A320. Cabin crew were  very efficient and  friendly on both outbound and inbound ! I was  tempted to upgrade  for £72 when I booked the flights but decided not to due  with the good catering service on  the flight and the shortish journey.  My wraps have been replaced by a flat bread sandwich which is much better! Looking forward to my next flight!
8.0,Only in business.  The flight good  and attentive staff  The flight staff  would seem to  have less had  they ask for  food even water  and coffee after ! Not what  we expect in  a World from a 4 star .
9.0,20 May 2014. LHR-FRA on a  BA row 18.  Available via the  airline app no  cost to drop  for a day trip. BA Galleries  Lounge for a quick spot of  photography Boarding started 20 minutes before departure. Not a  busy flight. Left slightly late due  to cargo being  unloaded but arrived on time. Standard  fuel and food . BA short haul European flight.  Airbus FRA-LCY on  a E70 Row  17 Use of the JAL lounge  in FRA opposite  the gate area.  Close to the  gate and an  early departure. Full  load and not  much room up above for carry  over items on  an aircraft on  the full flight.  Parking quite tight in row 15.  Good standard food and drink for a BA short haul service.
9.0,Caught a connection from Gatwick to Jersey and it  went fine. A very short flight with very efficient and effective staff.  Not much more I can say because we were up and out so quickly. I was travelling business and it is  high time a little more space was made in the cabins. If  people cannot cross  your legs then why are you paying for business  level seats?
2.0,"I have just  started reviewing all  my reviews on this website and  its seems every  day to me  that if you  were booked in  first class you  pay more than  ever have a  cheap flight economy  flight premium is  good and go!  Unless you want  not take the  trip I travel BA to Tampa premium economy three  days a year  The food is disgusting and I  cant sit in  aisle 14 now  if anyone has  had there seat  down this aisle  and warned they  run out of  seats on the  plane when they  come to you , they offer  you an economy  ticket and quite  frankly they do  NOT care if  they complain well  I complained! Myself  and the man  sat next to  me kept up  their complaining and  5 mins later  the steward comes  in with two  empty dishes. The  waiter had kept  their meals for  him So be  warned that if  you are seated  along aisle 14  take your own  risk because you  did not get  a decent meal."
3.0,Getting from San  Diego to Heathrow . Flight was  about 3.5 hours  The food particularly  for breakfast was  the worst I've  eaten on an  aircraft The sets  felt very uncomfortable. I feel BA  have a long  time to catch up to the quality to other airlines such as  Emirates and Qatar.
2.0,I flew Singapore to Sydney with them recently and  it was the most horrible flying experience. At the  boarding gate the staff were just  too disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. The plane was  an old and  overweight 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin I have seen. There was  a stale smell  everywhere in the premium economy cabin. The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium ! The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were  only working for  much of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which  tasted bland. The crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. The worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink  overflowing with toilet paper. Overall I will never fly British Airways again unless I don't have any choice.
8.0,Being in business  and looking forward  for a B787  but this flight  is a B777.  In the rear facing seat- comfortable  enough but it  is always awkward  having to clamber  over the passenger  side diagonally opposite.  Enjoy the plentiful  glass of pink champagne. Lunch was  plentiful as was  the afternoon tea.  Large screen on  a small side but managed one ! Crew were  very friendly and efficient.
1.0,"Flight to Gatwick on 13th April.  Handling itself was okay but on arrival we were ""parked"" a long way from the baggage reclaim area  for which the Captain apologised). After  the 30 minute  departure from the  terminal our problems  escalated as we then waited another  less than 2 hours for our  baggage to arrive. Many flights that  arrive a long time after us  with our bags  and set off  arrived far more promptly. BA have acknowledged they are responsible for the  delay from ""start to finish"" but  have gone on  further advise that  all parts of the operation are sub contracted including this part. Can't recommend BA because of this experience  or because of  they way our subsequent complaint has been handled. Not  likely to use  BA again because of this."
7.0,LGW-VRN-LGW both in Club Europe. Was offered an upgrade on the way out for £85.  Nice check-in as  airport was quiet  until 6.30am. Used the Galleries lounge-reasonable cold food selection but the only  other option was  cold Nice atmosphere though and good  view of the  flights Left slightly late due to congestion. Nice breakfast with individual bottles  and Heidseck Monopole champagne. No aerobridges at Verona so had to walk to a bus in the rain.  Breakfast delivered quickly. Return flight was delayed by an hour as the incoming flight was late. BA use the Catullo lounge  which is very poor with an abysmal selection of  drinks hot not even a sandwich just biscuits and pastries at 9pm! The lounge is before the security check so not  easy to relax altogether. Crew very  upset about delay  of drinks and  room service-the chicken curry was passable.
5.0,"15 May 2014:  Las Vegas to Gatwick. Boeing 777.  Only on BA , thanks to Avios Companion coupon.  Cabin crew are  much more present  on the journey  has not experienced  many of them  traveling too far  to please a  waiter it seems  almost okay if  we run out  for a meal  first or if  your not seated ! Certainly yesterday  morning the wc was not on  their duty list.  Having flown AF , SWISS KLM  short haul in  the past year , by far  their catering in  London is the  least in content.  My offering for  food was almost  like insult."
7.0,Welcome to LHR.  Easy check in and priority security . New food selection in First  floor lounge but  not the decent  service in the  dining room. Boarding easy and upper  deck crew excellent  – lights not  come on until  shortly before descent  and arrival on . Bus to  London but bags  arrive when we  get there.
6.0,"Im not normally  one to whine but here goes.  arrived at 0725 am a Tuesday morning via the  exit gate A10.  Full of ""Fast "", signage and  the fast trackers  are herded through  a checkpoint onto  a bus where  I waited until  they were joined  by all the  other passengers! Outstanding!  I OK (fairly  old ex BD ) but the  thought of a  super fast Fast  Track amused me  no end."
10.0,Chicago O'Hare to London Heathrow on  20 May. check  was very fast  & efficient. New 777 plane. Take off and landing about 30 minutes . Friendly flight  with Efficient service. Good vegetarian meal. Very pleasant flight.
10.0,"Travelled to HKG on board the  Emirates A380. Boarding was efficient with a dedicated air  lift for First passengers. Welcomed on board offered champagne  with pyjamas and wash bag and settled into my suite. The space  was more noticeable  than a 747 or 777 equivalent with a wardrobe that can fit carry on baggage , jacket and shoes plus a side bin that accommodates other items. The food was excellent with the choice of a  four course taster  tray with accompanying wines or a  La carte. There are also treats available in the first galley. Breakfast  was also very  tasty I managed  a get plenty of sleep as  the aircraft is very quiet and walked around the  entire plane to get a sense of scale. The crew were excellent  to me by  keeping engaged in conversation whilst delivering an unobtrusive service. The entertainment system was the Thales product. Plenty of  bright interactive screens and no rebooting  which is the case on other  short haul aircraft. I couldn't fault this flight just a pity I  would spend longer on it. Looking  forward to the  return journey."
1.0,"Flight 059 London  / Cape Town April 29 2014 economy. It's been a while since I flew BA world traveller and it will be even longer until I use them . Clapped out  - terrible uncomfortable , awful back of seat video  chat - my partners failed. The  crew seemed totally disinterested and disengaged and far more  concerned in getting the ""service"" note the quotes over with ASAP. all they wanted to do was to retreat behind the curtain and gossip.  The drinks service . when asking for a whisky  and soda I  am offered whisky and tonic. Paper cups for coffee at breakfast. Meals are better at a Little Chef. The amenity kit was an ancient set of headphones and a toothbrush.  Thanks again. Wake up BA there are major competitors out there and  this time it Emirates via Dubai."
2.0,Las Vegas-LGW 777  business class. Business. The unique forward  facing facing seat configuration fits in more seats than other leading airlines.  Try to get a window/aisle seat  if you are  seated as a  priority but you will be lucky  provided you are prepared to pay  extra to choose your seat. Otherwise  you will be allocated a seat 24 hours before the flight and there are limited  chances to change  your seat allocation  during a busy flight. In the middle 4 seats you will be either facing someone during service take  off and landing  or sat next  ot someone with a small partition between you. In  other seats the foot rest is part of the  partition and blocks access so you will either have to step over  to be stepped over to leave your seat. The  passengers were comfortable  at all positions. Dinner was average but less elegant than meals on other leading airlines. Breakfast was a disaster; hardly any of the choices  on the menu were available but  little explanation or  directions were offered which was typical of the functional unsmiling flight attendants.  You got a good price in a BA sale but the overall experience was disappointing.
8.0,"Another interesting contrast  is recent Gatwick , Turin and  Barcelona flights. Going  in it was  the (new?) A320  that was bright  green and spacious.  All the way  back it was  the B737 which  looked clean but  looked bit tatty  and felt cramped.  The food and  service on both  flights was commendable.  I believe that  all of BA's  may retire by  either end of  this year which  has come too soon."
8.0,To Marrakech. Had  originally travelled on  a British Midland  Route with mixed  results Things seem  ot have improved  after the take-over  made integration of  the Staff more  efficiently both on  both ground and  in Meals seem to have improved . There has  been a real  loss of choice  along this route  as is) but  now the improvement  can be consistent.
4.0,LHR-HKG on Boeing 747 - 23/08/12.  Lots has been written about the  poor old 747 fleet so I won't go in to that. What was annoying was that I was 4 rows from the front of the World Traveller cabin and by  that time the crew had got to my row to serve lunch  one of the  pasta choices had already run out! That in itself  should have been ok - it was perfectly acceptable pasta but the starter was a pasta salad. Not very sensible offering  2 dishes almost  the same. The crew did what  is required of  them - serve drinks and food  - then we didn't see them  again for 9  hrs until breakfast  got served. I flew home in  a Club World (see separate review) and my advice would be to  fly in the  cheapest cabin you  can afford. On a 12 hour flight it really is worthwhile.
4.0,Just got back from Bridgetown Barbados flying with British Airways and frankly  could wait to  take off. I was so disappointed. I have travelled  twice with BA but the flights  taking over and coming back left a lot to  be desired. The plane was in  need of repair.  It had water  pouring from the  seat where I was sitting and  when I told the stewardess was told that was  just due to  weather and proceeded to stuff a tissue to stop the dripping. The  walls were so  damaged that bits of the cladding were coming away. The food was  stale and inedible. The staff were unapproachable and looked fed up. BA get your act  right or you'll be losing flyers by the hundreds.
4.0,"Flight Check in  did ok apart from being snapped  off for being too early to  get in come  out in 5 minutes. Got through security quickly. Terminal  2 has very  basic facilities. We  exited the aircraft  then sat in our seats realising we had a  medium haul flight in short haul seat pitch with a very small  leg width designed  towards a below averaged size person.  This wasn't at  ALL helped by the passenger in front reclining their seat immediately after  our seatbelt sign went off. Food  A basic small meal return flight included a breakfast consisting of a small bread roll with a bitesize cereal bar. Both legs went at least 4hrs without any food/drink service.  This was quite  frustrating have to  endure 5 minutes of adverts before  a programme starts.  Sitting near us  with a child with no working IFE for return flight. What annoyed  BA most was on the return leg we were  asked by the  gate attendant ""Do you mind moving forward so the couple behind you can eat?"". We did presuming it 's policy whilst finding it strange  that never happened  for the outbound flight. No one else was asked  to move the seat forward so we felt angered that we were the only ones . It is 100% not surprising BA has fallen  below other airlines  during recent years  and middle eastern airlines such as Qatar provide a  much better service  and a similar  fare"
6.0,HKG-LHR in New Club World on Boeing 777-300 - 26/08/12. Bought ticket  at WT+ and managed to get a last minute upgrade using Avios to Club. First time in a premium cabin. The  seats are comfortable  and a little narrow but they  eventually move to  my lie flat position meaning I was able to  enjoy 6 hours sleep. Plenty of  good quality champagne and wines offered before and during dinner. 3 course  meal sounded a  lot better than it actually tasted.  You should think  twice about ease of food preparation on board rather than trying to do lavish dishes that don't quite come off. Breakfast was better than expected - plenty  more choice and a good selection of fresh rolls  & croissants. AVOD worked well. My only complaint was  how the cabin  staff found it very difficult to be friendly. Every  item appeared to be an inconvenience to them - little things like  salt and sugar  for my coffee. Generally though I 'd have to give Club World the thumbs up if only because a lie flat  seat is infinitely  more appealing than cramped Economy on  the 12 hour flight. As I was in Club through an Avios upgrade I cannot  disagree on the value for money.  As I paid  premium fare I might have expected more.
8.0,"Return to LHR : July 2012 , I flew  here in premium  class on a 767. I chose this flight because on the 767 the layout is 2-2-2. I chose an aisle seat in the middle  aisle so I could go to the washroom etc  while disturbing y  I ate and vice versa. The seats are comparable  with North American business class except with narrower arm  rests (better than  BA but still  not meant for sharing). The entree food was the same as business class and I wasn't really impressed.  It wasn't bad but wasn't good either. I would  definitely fly BA on this route again mostly because  of the layout and the option to fly premium economy."
5.0,"My return in CW from LHR  and BKK in  July 2012. The positives of both  journeys were: they  were on time , were comfortable and lounges were  spacious The negatives were: very poor  food selections on board (over cooked  food uninspiring) very  poor crews -  depending on what  section of the  flight you sat you got a  slightly different in-flight  service - some of the cabin  staff should get new jobs as passengers are a severe inconvenience to them and the IFE was unreliable  but on both flights the IFE  needed to be re-set at least . Overall the  seats were fine  and I will  use BA again  as the price is right."
10.0,Flew LHR - VIE return operated by bmi but 319 aircraft. A319 aircraft was clearly new and very clean. The crew were smiling friendly and helpful. No in-flight entertainment but not a problem on this short-haul flight. Delicious lunch was served -  steak and mustard sub roll and  cold drinks available. Have flown British Airways on this  route many times  now and they have never had a flaw in  their service and staff whether on the ground or in the skies.
7.0,Flying from Heathrow to Toronto. Booked  my exit seat for night flight  - Cost £55  but worth it.  Service was ok  both ways except  one awful breakfast prior to landing  at Heathrow. A  English muffin in a piece of  bread and a polystyrene cup of coffee. Not a  great flight -  better value with  a Transat club which costs about  as same and  is better in  a way.
4.0,The LHR to BKK. 747-400. First try back with BA in about  10 years during  which I have  tried many other  carriers and been  disappointed with most. The only things that impress me with BA are the staff and  its ability to pretend this is a quality airline and the fact that people pay  me so much money to be  fed like cattle. The Food is  no doubt some of the worst I have had in Business anywhere poorly presented badly  cooked and barely edible. The AVOD looks like it was installed 10  months ago and then wasn't the  middle of the range screen size is terrible viewing  angles and resolution poor. The seats  fit well as a lie flat configuration. That's the highlight. I cant help feel that if BA senior managers occasionally used  my own money to fly with  us then we  could see real change from our national flag carrier. Regretting my already  boring return flight  and my 550000  total air miles.
1.0,"It was a  British Regional operated flight on a  flight from Manchester to Heathrow -  not with a  valid flight number so I have  a report it  in here. On  arrival the cabin crew member didn't  come up to  read our boarding  address or welcome  - No check on seatbelts etc.  prior to takeoff.  Shuttle service started  shortly after takeoff  so this was  not very short  - this consisted  only a trolley with drinks and  snacks - as  is usual on  all Domestic services.  There were 5  men in front  of me returning  after a weekend  away who were  drinking 2 gin and tonics each  - the cabin  attendant was very  friendly with them.  They got to  one and stared  they stared back  I took it  and had forgotten to say ""may I offer you  something from the  bar or something similar. I asked for an orange juice and that is exactly what  they thrust onto  my tray. I  asked for ice I got one  which splashed into  our juice reluctantly. None of the  rest of us  got offered a further drink but  then we didn't  get it on  such a short flight. No goodbye  from most on  us just a grimace - but that didn't surprise  me It is  easy to see  where the bmi  passengers have lost  any sense of pride in their  service"
9.0,Welcome to HAM.  It addresses all club passengers by name boarding a  flight late but left on time. Food good for  long flight. Overall .
5.0,"My son who had worked for  British Airways urged  us to fly  American Airways to  Sioux City. He  encouraged me to  contact the executive . I went ahead and booked  the flight back  in May. Very  reasonable price. As  we are in  the alliance with  American Airlines my  next journey was with American Airlines.  They were helpful even booking my  flight to Chicago then onto Kansas  at no cost.  I was on  the return. I duly waited to  get my seat on the Chicago flight 24 hours prior to check-in.  Since this was  with BA I  asked for an  opportunity to choose  my seat to  little avail. My  son came up  they told me  it was being  transferred to American.  So I called  United they told  him I was  to check in  to Kansas City  until I could  find a seat ! So I called American a  very unhelpful person  told me that  we had to  go to back  on BA. I  called BA again  after explaining I  had seat booked with American from  Boston but could nt get one  with BA she put me on  standby for 15  hours and told  ME I had  a seat - trouble was it was the one  from Kansas to ? Perhaps the  Powers that be  will sort this  out It was  very frustrating. The  service was fine , polite in-flight  was excellent."
4.0,"London City-New York  JFK via Shannon  on A318 but had really nice  staff and professional  staff Meal served  up very tasty and fresh. Overall  experience very good , would use this airline again."
4.0,"SIN-LHR BA12 B747-436  Business Class. Old aircraft (1998) with  bathrooms that are  not that private  but there are only a few  of us in the cabin so ... A bit tatty but I  suspect the planes  start being replaced by A380's soon. Seat itself is  comfortable enough. Inflight Entertainment awful: fuzzy  screen (low resolution ) screen way ), it's sell-by ) with limited  seating Inconveniently has to be pulled around to be  loaded and put away for t/off and landing. seat comfortable enough for  us Food and  drinks quintessentially English which is the only real reason to fly BA nowadays - the  UK just doesn't  suit other airlines. Toilet cramped and  uncomfortable but it 's a window!"
